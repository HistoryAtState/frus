                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government.
                    The series documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of
                    policies and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. A statutory charter for
                    the preparation of the series was established by Title IV of the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351 <hi rend="italic">et
                    seq</hi>.), which was added by Section 198 of Public Law 102–138, signed by
                    President George Bush on October 28, 1991.</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts which contributed to the formulation of policies and records
                    providing supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>
                <p>The volume presented here, which was compiled and prepared as a book manuscript
                    in 1987, meets all the standards of selection and editing prevailing in the
                    Department of State at that time and complies fully with the spirit of the
                    standards of selection, editing, and range of sources established by the statute
                    of October 28, 1991. This volume records policies and events of more than 30
                    years ago, but the statute allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year
                    line in the publication of the series.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in
                    the foreign policy of the final 3 years (1958–1960) of the administration of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>. This
                    subseries comprises 18 print volumes totaling more than 16,000 pages and 7
                    microfiche supplements presenting more than 14,000 pages of original
                    documents.</p>
                <p>This particular volume presents documentation on U.S. policy toward and relations
                    with the countries of Africa south of the Sahara. Material on North Africa,
                    including the conflict in Algeria, is in Volume XIII, Arab-Israeli Dispute;
                    United Arab Republic; North Africa.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The original research, compilation, and editing of this volume were done in 1981
                    and 1982 under the Department regulation derived from Secretary of State
                    Kellogg’s charter of 1925. This regulation prescribed that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series include “a comprehensive record of the major
                    foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities.” The regulation further stipulated that the additional
                    required records “needed to supplement the documentation in the Department” be
                    obtained from other government agencies. The Department of State’s historians
                    have had, for the series in general and for the particular volume published
                    here, complete and unconditional access to all records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat which comprehended all the official papers
                    created by or submitted to the Secretary of State; the special decentralized
                    files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division level;
                    the files of all overseas diplomatic and consular posts and U.S. special
                    missions; and all the official correspondence with foreign governments and with
                    other Federal agencies. Any failure to include a complete Department of State
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series <pb n="V"
                        xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"/>cannot be attributed to constraints or
                    limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access to Department
                    records, information security regulations and practices notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians preparing the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, including the volume published here, have enjoyed
                    full access to the papers of the Presidents and to all other White House foreign
                    policy records. All of this documentation has been made available for use in the
                    preparation of the Foreign Relations series thanks to the exceptional
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration, its
                    Office of Presidential Libraries, and the individual Presidential library. The
                    Department of State owes particular thanks for the research of this volume to
                    the staff of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library.</p>
                <p>In addition to Presidential correspondence and records of Presidential meetings
                    and conversations, the documentation in the White House files at the Eisenhower
                    Library was the most important source for the preparation of the volume
                    published here. Department editors had full and complete access at the Library
                    to all the institutional documentation of the National Security Council (<gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) including the memoranda of discussion at
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings, formal <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> documents, and related papers. There was also full access to
                    the subject files of Presidential records (particularly the Whitman File), the
                    files of other White House officials, and more informal policy documentation in
                    other collections in the Eisenhower Library. It should be noted that the editors
                    supplemented the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records from the Eisenhower
                    Library with documents in the Department of State files.</p>
                <p>The records preserved and maintained at the Presidential libraries include some
                    of the most significant foreign affairs documentation of other Federal agencies
                    such as the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State historians, with the
                    considerable cooperation of the various agencies, have obtained access to
                    records requested for possible inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes. Access to records of other agencies maintained at
                    the Presidential libraries has been supplemented by special research visits to
                    the historical files retained by these agencies or transferred to the National
                    Archives and Records Administration. Department historians have enjoyed steadily
                    broadened access to the records of the Department of Defense, particularly the
                    records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of
                    Defense.</p>
                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the United States Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the United <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>States Government cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Although prepared in compliance with an earlier Department regulation,
                    this volume was prepared in a manner fully consonant with the standards and
                    mandates for compilation contained in the 1991 statute.</p>
                <p>The List of Sources, pages XIII–XVII, identifies the particular files and
                    collections used in the preparation of this volume.</p>

                    Volume XIV</p>
                <p>In selecting documents for the volume published here, the editors have given
                    primary consideration to those records that would most fully explain the
                    formulation of U.S. Government policies toward Africa as a whole and the
                    individual regions and states of Africa. The decisions of and recommendations to
                    the President regarding these policies are fully documented as are the
                    discussions and actions of the National Security Council. The policy options
                    considered or adopted by the Secretary of State and the most important of his
                    actions to implement Presidential decisions are also comprehensively
                    documented.</p>
                <p>Correspondence and other exchanges between the U.S. Government and the nations of
                    Africa, nations with interests in Africa, and with the United Nations were
                    included to document the main lines of policy implementation on major issues and
                    to indicate the important items of information that attended Presidential
                    decisions and policy recommendations by the Secretary of State. The editors also
                    included selected intelligence reports and estimates and reports from diplomatic
                    posts that had, or may have had, some impact on the making of major
                    policies.</p>
                <p>The editors have not attempted to document the wider range of day-to-day
                    relationships, issues, and contacts between the United States and African
                    nations nor have they sought to present the record of the establishment and
                    conduct of diplomatic and consular posts or the appointments to these posts. The
                    editors also have not researched the files of other Federal agencies in order to
                    provide a comprehensive record of how those agencies contributed to formulation,
                    execution, or support of economic, military, and cultural policies toward the
                    African nations.</p>
                <p>In selecting documents for this volume, the editors have concentrated exclusively
                    on presenting previously classified or undisclosed records. Public statements
                    and agreements have not been included, but previously released information has
                    been appropriately identified to elucidate documents printed here for the first
                    time.</p>
                <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>
                <p>The amount of documentation devoted to Sub-Saharan Africa is substantially larger
                    than in previous volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    reflecting the increased attention that U.S. policymakers had to give to the
                    region as many African countries attained independence in the 1958–1960 period.
                    To present U.S. policies toward Africa within one volume, the editors have
                    focused on a selection of the most important issues.</p>
                <p>The editors believe that the Congo crisis was the single most important issue in
                    U.S. policy toward Africa in the period; more than half the volume is devoted to
                    the crisis, which began in mid-1960. Another major portion of the volume
                    provides key documentation on U.S. policies toward Africa in a regional context.
                    Those sections include documentation concerning general policy toward Africa,
                    the recognition of newly-independent states, and policy concerning the Horn of
                    Africa. Separate compilations are devoted to Ghana, Guinea, and South Africa,
                    each of which presented policy issues of broad significance. Guinea raised the
                    problem of recognition of a country that had unilaterally chosen independence,
                    when the former colonial power was discouraging international recognition. Delay
                    in U.S. recognition and establishment of diplomatic relations troubled relations
                    with Guinea and demonstrated the futility of such an approach. U.S. relations
                    with Ghana’s President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Kwame Nkrumah</persName> and
                    Guinea’s President Sekou Touré posed the problem of dealing with left-leaning
                    third-world governments. South Africa, with its system of apartheid, raised
                    policy issues of long-term significance with implications for U.S. policy toward
                    other regimes in southern Africa. Documentation on policies toward other African
                    countries is included in the regional compilations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Special Note on Intelligence Documents</p>
                <p>At the time the volume was originally compiled, the editors had access to
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates at
                    the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State. Other intelligence
                    records in the Eisenhower Library collections and Department of State files were
                    also consulted. These records did not, however, include material concerning the
                    planning and preparation for the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi> of the Senate Select
                    Committee on Intelligence, which was based on interviews and on <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> documents that the Agency had made available to
                    the Committee. The editors have identified in editorial notes and footnotes
                    drawing upon documents quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi> the
                    sources currently publicly available on the Lumumba episode.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>
                <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its
                    preparation for publication coincided with the development of procedures since
                    early 1991 by the Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with the Department
                    of State that have expanded access by Department historians to high-level
                    intelligence documents from among those records still in the custody of the
                    Central Intelligence Agency. Some of the documents made available to Department
                    historians were among those quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Interim Report</hi>
                    The editors concluded that locating and obtaining access to all the pertinent
                    documentation and submitting it for declassification review would have
                    necessitated considerable further delay in the publication of this volume. They
                    chose not to postpone publication of the prepared manuscript. The Department is,
                    however, using this expanded access, as arranged by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, for compilation of future volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.
                    Washington has not been included in the dateline if a document originated there
                    or if a conversation took place there.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are
                    corrected, but other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman
                    type. Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals
                    with an unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. The amount of material omitted because it was unrelated,
                    however, is not accounted for. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the
                    source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0013"/>major
                    policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been made to determine if a
                    document has been previously published, and this information has been included
                    in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The declassification review process for this volume resulted in the withholding
                    from publication of .38 percent of the manuscript as originally compiled. Most
                    of the excisions were of material pertaining to intelligence sources and
                    methods. Others included information given in confidence by foreign officials
                    and material that might be considered offensive.</p>
                <p>The Division of Historical Documents Review of the Office of Freedom of
                    Information, Privacy, and Classification Review, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National Security Information
                    and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X"
                        facs="0014"/>other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the
                    appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments.</p>

                    <p>I have done my best to make this brief, but Africa is a large place. I have
                        attempted to deal here with what I count as basic elements but I have
                        covered the separate territories in extensive oral briefings both within and
                        without the Department. These are impressions gained from one trip and
                        limited prior study.</p>
                    <p>It is risky to generalize about Africa. Some overall observations may be made
                        but their validity and applications vary. It is useful to bear in mind some
                        of the broad divisions in which the Continent and its problems fall, even
                        though these divisions are by no means precise. The first of these is the
                        difference between the Arab-Berber area of the Mediterranean coast and the
                        territory south of the Sahara. Another division is the differences between
                        the colonial policies and administrations of Great Britain, France, Belgium,
                        and Portugal. A third category is represented by the two independent
                        countries, Liberia and Ethiopia, which have never had the material benefit
                        of colonial rule and where progress, in terms of human welfare, is at the
                        lowest level. A fourth division is between the colonial territories where
                        there is a large white population and those areas where there is not. In
                        this connection, the Union of South Africa represents a separate
                        problem.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0032"/>
                    <p>By taking the foregoing into account, it is reasonably safe to record certain
                        general impressions. The movement toward self-government and independence by
                        Africans is a strong one and is accelerating. It is a real and powerful
                        phenomenon that is not always well-reasoned but is daily gaining momentum. A
                        few thoughtful African leaders are aware that there is too much haste and
                        too little preparation, but their moderating influence is slight, and they
                        are themselves often the captives of their own political actions,
                        declarations, and ambitions.</p>
                    <p>A relatively advanced degree of self-government has been granted in the
                        French and some of the British territories which in most cases seems to whet
                        local appetites for faster progress and to stimulate confidence in African
                        leaders in their ability to manage their own affairs. Resistance to the
                        increasing pressures for self-rule is strong in the Belgian Congo and much
                        stronger in the Portuguese territories and these colonial powers, in the
                        order named, will probably be the last to acknowledge the inevitability of
                        acceding to these pressures. I am convinced that in the long term all of the
                        colonial and trust territories and in Africa will achieve either complete
                        independence or independence qualified only by voluntary but equal
                        association with the metropolitan powers. Everywhere I went in black Africa,
                        I found varying expressions of “better the ragged shirt of independence than
                        the warm blanket of colonial protection”.</p>
                    <p>This movement toward self-government is being carried forward within the
                        framework of Western Europe political systems and social and economic
                        advances are based on concepts which Europeans have developed over the
                        centuries and which are suited to them and expressive of them. There is
                        grave doubt that these systems and concepts will turn out to be valid for
                        Africa. It may be that eventually there will evolve political, social, and
                        economic systems consistent with and expressive of the African personality
                        which still preserve the essentials of democracy and individual liberty. But
                        before such a happy result can be achieved, I foresee a very difficult and
                        probably long period of uncertainty, bad management, retrogression and
                        conflict with a strong chance of violence in some areas. There will be
                        plenty of troubled waters for Communist fishing.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion the most difficult problem in the modernization of Africa, and
                        the greatest factor making for instability, is detribalization. This vast,
                        primitive population is largely illiterate, more than half Pagan, and is
                        practically leaping from the Iron Age into the 20th Century. Africans are
                        being pulled away from a long-accepted way of life toward a more complicated
                        existence for which they are, in the mass, almost totally unprepared. The
                        change to modernity involves the abrupt abandonment of ancient folk-ways
                        which provided a sense of social, economic and even religious security and
                        an attempt to take <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0033"/>on a new set of
                        rules of life, little understood, and for which the African is not yet
                        fitted by education or experience. This swift transition is uprooting him
                        violently from the old, long before he is fitted to cope with the new. Even
                        with the African elite of the most highly educated and most sophisticated,
                        modernization has had limited success. This state of affairs will be bound
                        to continue for a long time and will produce instability and upheaval with
                        the accompanying danger that the population will be exploited by
                        unscrupulous and little qualified African leaders from within, or by noxious
                        influences from without, or both. By and large the Nationalist movements are
                        in the hands of moderates and it behooves us, as well as the colonial
                        powers, to be sympathetic to their desire for independence and to gain their
                        confidence in order effectively to counsel continued moderation and
                        patience. These moderate leaders will be expected by the people to produce
                        tangible results in the form of economic and social improvement. By
                        assisting in these fields, we can lend important support to their leaders.
                        This can be done through our aid programmes and by the encouragement of
                        investment and development by private enterprise.</p>

                        Africa, French Equatorial Africa and Madagascar. In Cameroun and Togo
                        separate administrative measures applied to this basic law granted these two
                        Trust Territories an increased degree of self-government. Elections were
                        held in all of these territories in the spring of 1957 and were followed by
                        the formation of territorial legislative assemblies and Councils of
                        Ministers. Most of the powers of local government are now in the hands of
                        native authorities with French officials acting as advisers and with
                        reserved powers being exercised by French High Commissioners. The more
                        important of the reserved powers are those affecting foreign affairs,
                        defense, and fiscal matters. The system seemed to be working well,
                        especially in French West Africa for which, in fact, it was designed through
                        the influence of African members of the French National Assembly led by
                        Felix Houphouet-Boigny, an African of the Ivory Coast and a Minister in the
                            present<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">He was Minister of Public Health in

                        It is working less well in the other territories where there are fewer
                        native leaders qualified to cope with a sudden and substantial grant of
                        power. The <hi rend="italic">Loi-Cadre</hi> has been considered in <pb n="4"
                            xml:id="pg_4" facs="0034"/>Paris to be an organic act establishing the
                        relationships between France and its African possessions for the indefinite
                        future. In Africa, it is viewed only as a step toward complete
                        self-government.</p>
                    <p>A serious problem in the political evolution of the French African
                        territories is that neither the French nor the Africans can foresee the
                        shape of their eventual relationship with the metropole. This is because no
                        one really knows what the French Union is and much less what it is likely to
                        become. The status of British territories after independence is clear;
                        membership in the Commonwealth. Even though no one has been able to define
                        the Commonwealth membership, it is an accepted goal.</p>
                    <p>African leaders in all the French territories were unanimous in their
                        attitude that they wanted to arrive at a close relationship with France—a
                        “Franco-African Community”, but one which would be determined by mutual
                        agreement <hi rend="italic">between equals</hi> and not by dispensation from
                        Paris. The French West Africans would like to see the French Union changed
                        into a “Confederation” in which the Republic would be one unit; French West
                        Africa, a second; French Equatorial Africa, a third; Madagascar a fourth and
                        probably Cameroun and Togo a fifth and sixth. There is also talk of
                        eventually including Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. They foresee these
                        territories as being all equal with the “Confederation” having only those
                        powers arrogated to it by the constituent units. There is a good deal of
                        dynamism behind this idea and we may see some interesting developments when
                        it encounters ingrained French centralism and basic conservatism. It would
                        be a remarkable political phenomenon if pressure from black Africa should
                        bring about a revolutionary change in the French constitutional structure. I
                        should not hazard a guess as to the outcome of this contest, but I am bold
                        enough to state the opinion that either the French Union will be changed to
                        permit substantially the same degree of autonomy for its African territories
                        as that enjoyed by members of the Commonwealth or those territories will
                        break away entirely and become separate, independent states. In either
                        contingency, there is a strong likelihood of fragmentation of the eight
                        territories of French West Africa and the four of French Equatorial
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The British Territories.</p>
                    <p>It is less easy to generalize about British territories where there is no
                        scheme of overall applicability such as the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Loi-Cadre.</hi> However, there is the declared policy of <gloss
                            target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> to lead dependent territories toward
                        self-government as rapidly as they are capable of accepting that
                        responsibility. Progress varies widely from that in Nigeria which will
                        probably become independent in April 1960<note n="4" xml:id="d1fn4">The
                            actual date was October 1, 1960.</note> to the High Commission <pb n="5"

                        Bechuanaland where much remains to be done and where the situation is
                        complicated by the fact that the first two are islands of British rule in
                        the sea of the Union of South Africa and three-fourths of the boundary of
                        the third is with the Union.</p>
                    <p>The presence in some British areas of white settlers in substantial numbers
                        who sooner or later will become minorities in states possessing large
                        African political majorities creates a situation of utmost seriousness.
                        Although some progress has been made by the Federation of the Rhodesias and
                        Nysaland in the plan of “Racial Partnership”, this progress is very slow in
                        comparison with African aspirations. Many expect that the Federation will
                        become an independent member of the Commonwealth, soon after its
                        constitution comes up for revision in 1960. If so it will be white
                        independence and the racial problem will remain unsolved.</p>
                    <p>I found in all the British territories an enlightened, progressive attitude.
                        There were a few individual exceptions but by and large there was a desire
                        to improve the lot of the natives and to prepare them as rapidly as possible
                        for self-government. There was a realistic recognition of the magnitude of
                        the task and lack of funds to carry it forward was universally deplored.
                        There was also a sense of urgency and fear that there is not enough time for
                        orderly preparation. I share this concern and think that we must be prepared
                        to deal with African states which will get independence long before they are
                        qualified to govern themselves.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Belgian Congo.</p>
                    <p>Belgian colonial policy has always been paternalistic beginning with the
                        acquisition of the Congo as a personal domain by Leopold II. Authorities in
                        the Congo have followed a programme of wide-spread elementary education,
                        vocational training and improvement in the standard of living. They have
                        gone in for a very limited amount of secondary education and none at the
                        college level until a year ago.</p>
                    <p>I got the impression that the Belgians were being jolted a bit from the
                        self-satisfaction that their programme was successful and that the Congo’s
                        population was politically docile. The virus of self-government has reached
                        the Congo and there appeared to be a rather recent realization on the part
                        of Belgian officials of its potential strength, coupled with a new sense of
                        urgency to do something about it. There was substantial evidence of African
                        self-assertion which will increase in volume and power in spite of anything
                        the authorities may do.</p>
                    <p>The Congo has always been ruled from Brussels with all political power in the
                        hands of the Governor General. The first move toward self-government, for
                        either Belgians or Africans, was made in December when municipal advisory
                        councils were elected from a common <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0036"
                        />roll for Leopoldville and Elisabethville, with elections in other cities
                        to follow. This is a small concession to African political aspirations, but
                        it is a beginning.</p>
                    <p>The Belgians will be slow to move but I believe that they will move in an
                        effort to preserve their economic position and political influence. They
                        will be stubborn, but Belgians have a way of looking out for their
                        equities.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Portuguese Territories.</p>
                    <p>The Portuguese insist that their African territories are not colonies but
                        overseas provinces of Portugal and the authoritarian political system of the
                        metropole is applied with even a stricter degree of control. They have done
                        little to improve the lot of Africans and forced labor is still openly
                        practiced.</p>
                    <p>The Portuguese show adeptness in the exercise of their rigid control, somehow
                        producing the appearance of lack of severity. They are very alert to any
                        evidence of African self-assertion and quick to suppress it. There is
                        constant vigilance to insulate the native population from outside influences
                        but there is a break in the insulation in Mozambique resulting from Africans
                        numbering into the hundreds of thousands returning from contracted labor in
                        the mines of the South African Union. In Angola, the Congo district
                        represents a similar but smaller breach of the insulation.</p>
                    <p>The Portuguese will probably be the last to give in to African self-rule but
                        sooner or later they will have to do so.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Union of South Africa.</p>
                    <p>There will be a general election in April which will return a parliament with
                        a five year mandate. Everyone with whom I talked predicted that the
                        Nationalist Party will remain in power probably with an increase in seats
                        resulting from gerrymandering, but with a reduced, possibly minority,
                        popular vote.<note n="5" xml:id="d1fn5">The Nationalist Party increased its

                    </p>
                    <p>This is a dead-end policy. Lip service is given to the theory of generous but
                        separate programmes of improvement for the Africans within their own
                        reserves, but need for black labor in white areas and lack of appropriated
                        funds have prevented progress.</p>
                    <p>In spite of harassment by the Government, there is growing confidence of the
                        African, Asian and “colored” leaders. In this they are encouraged by the

                        There is being built up on the basis of envy and resentment a burning hatred
                        for the whites; the atmosphere of sullen hostility was very apparent in
                        Johannesburg. I am afraid that if there is no change in the present attitude
                        of sitting firmly on the boiler it will one day explode and I saw little
                        evidence of any disposition to alter present policies although I did hear
                        some expressions of concern and fear for the future. No doubt the existing
                        situation can be controlled and continued for some time to come, but one day
                        a change will occur, probably through economic boycott and general strike

                        pattern cannot be ruled out. Ten million Africans, 400,000 Asians and more
                        that a million “colored” will not submit forever to discrimination, lack of
                        opportunity and humiliation. I am not qualified to predict when the change
                        will come but I am convinced that the European South Africans haven’t as
                        much time as they think. Some observers say not more than five to ten
                        years.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Islam.</p>
                    <p>Islam has a natural appeal to black Africans: its permits polygamy; the
                        brotherhood of Islam is real; it is something to join with a new kind of hat
                        to wear; it is adaptable to African customs and even superstitions, and it
                        is not the religion of white Europeans.</p>
                    <p>In West Africa there is a great band of Mohammedanism in the savannas and
                        desert areas, back from the coast, from Mauritania in the north swinging in
                        a broad arc down to the Belgian Congo. This population is largely composed
                        of Hamitic, and Nilotic tribes, consciously differing in race, language,
                        religion and mores from the Negroes of the coast. Mauritania, Senegal and
                        the French Sudan are about 100% Moslem and the northern regions of the other
                        territories are largely Mohammedan. In Nigeria, for example, there are
                        approximately 16,000,000 Mohammedans in the Northern Provinces out of a
                        country-wide population of 34,000,000. Increasing numbers of coast Negroes
                        in the West African territories are being converted to Islam.</p>
                    <p>With the discretion imposed by my limited time in this area, I made inquiries
                        about Egyptian influence. I found that it was less important than I had
                        expected and the consensus of informed opinion was that there was no great
                        danger that this black Moslem population would ever follow Nasser or any
                        other Arab leader. One reason given was that the memory of Arab slave
                        traders was too green. However, I think that we should be alert to the
                        emergence of another black <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0038"/>Mahdi<note

                        Islamic nationalist movement. These are warlike folk, numbering 25 to 30
                        million, and if such a movement were to develop it might well upset the
                        political structure all along the West Coast from Mauritania to the
                        Congo.</p>
                    <p>On the East Coast there are large Islamic populations from Egypt south
                        through Zanzibar and into Tanganyika. However, the situation here is
                        different. The rate of conversion of Pagans to Mohammedanism is slower.
                        There are rather stable non-African Islamic communities, especially in
                        Tanganyika and Kenya, principally Ismailis.<note n="8" xml:id="d1fn8"
                            >Followers of the Aga Khan.</note> The Sudan, excepting the pagan South,
                        the Somalias and somewhere near one-half of the Ethiopians are Moslem. Here
                        the Egyptians through Radio Cairo (the Voice of Free Africa), school
                        teachers, and other means have made some progress. However, there is
                        evidence in both Somalia and the Sudan that their heavy-handedness has
                        limited success. We shall be able to form a better opinion of the
                        effectiveness of these Egyptian activities when we can assess the power of
                        Mohammed Hussein, a Nasser disciple, who attended the recent Cairo
                        Afro-Asian Conference<note n="9" xml:id="d1fn9">The Afro-Asian Peoples’

                        who has recently been elected President of the Somalia Youth League. There
                        will be general elections in the Sudan next month, in which the Egyptians
                        will meddle, and the results will allow us a better judgment of Egyptian
                        influence there.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Black Versus White.</p>
                    <p>The black African’s attitude toward the white man shades from universal envy
                        through mistrust and fear to burning hate. That is a sweeping statement, but
                        I believe it to be true and of such importance that we should have it
                        constantly in mind as background to our actions and decisions as the
                        evolution of Africa proceeds.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communism.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have diplomatic missions in Libya, Ethiopia and the Sudan with an
                        additional one to be established in Ghana. Aside from these, Communist
                        penetration of Africa has been through trade unions, youth organizations,
                        the subversion of students in Paris and London and trade arrangements. A
                        considerable number of African political leaders, especially in West Africa,
                        have been avowed Communists or fellow travellers, some Moscow trained. Most
                        of these have renounced their Communist affiliations and have switched their
                        activities to Nationalist movements.</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0039"/>
                    <p>The permanent organization set up by the Cairo Afro-Asian Conference will be
                        a new instrument for penetration and such penetration will be more difficult
                        to combat as dependent territories become independent. Soviet money and
                        management will make this instrument a formidable one. More formidable still
                        if they use the Egyptians with skill, avoid the appearance of competition
                        with Egypt and keep Communist objectives hidden under the cloak of
                        Nationalism. I see no way to meet this threat except by concerted action
                        with other Western powers, especially those having possession in Africa.
                        This will require an understanding on their part of our objectives, and a
                        higher degree of confidence in our motives in Africa, than now exists. The
                        genuine danger with which we are all confronted should make this possible,
                        for it is clear that if Africa is lost to the West, Europe will be so
                        weakened and out-flanked as to make its defense impossible.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Libya, the Sudan and the Horn of Africa.</p>
                    <p>Next after Algeria these seem to me to be the immediately critical areas to
                        which we should give special attention and where we should very
                        substantially increase our political, economic, and military efforts. I
                        consider that Libya, the Sudan, Ethiopia and emerging Somalia should be
                        strengthened and secured in their ties to the West in order to protect
                        Africa. These are all very primitive countries, much has to be done that
                        will cost large sums, but I feel that the money would be well spent.</p>
                    <p>Relations between Ethiopia and the Sudan are excellent and their common
                        interest in the Nile is a strong bond. The Sudan, and especially its able
                        Prime Minister,<note n="10" xml:id="d1fn10">Abdullah Khalil.</note> ought to
                        be used in bringing about settlement of the Ethiopian-Somalia border; a
                        problem which we should make it our business to see settled before Somalia’s
                        independence on January 1, 1960.</p>
                    <p>Libya is weak, disunited, and very vulnerable to Egypt. The only element of
                        political strength in that country today is the power and prestige of the
                            king.<note n="11" xml:id="d1fn11">Idris I.</note> If he should die
                        suddenly, there would be a breakdown of central authority, a possible
                        separation of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania and conflict between the two must
                        not be ruled out. In any event, without strong intervention from the
                        outside, Libya could under these circumstances fall easy prey to Egypt.
                        British influence is very important here and we should do all we can to
                        encourage the UK to continue its active support. This brings me to North
                        Africa.</p>
                    <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0040"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">North Africa.</p>
                    <p>Behind Libya lies frightened Tunisia, war in Algeria and all the troubled
                        relationships of France with these two and Morocco. It is not necessary to
                        recite the dangers of the situation. But I want to express the opinion that
                        France cannot win with present attitudes and methods. Unless there is a
                        change and some form of negotiated settlement is reached, the French
                        position in North Africa will be lost with the grave danger that the area
                        will be lost to the West as well. I believe that before matters get worse we
                        should attempt, with British concurrence, to persuade France to change its
                        attitude and should that attempt fail, to serve notice that we propose to do
                        what we can to save the North African littoral in the name of Western
                        security.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. That the Sudan be included in the area for which the Bureau of African
                        Affairs is to be responsible.</p>
                    <p>2. That a programme for strengthening our position in Libya, the Sudan and
                        the Horn of Africa be developed without delay.</p>
                    <p>3. That the quality and quantity of our personnel in Africa be given a high
                        priority, especially in those territories where we shall be obliged to
                        establish Embassies in the near future. These will include Somalia, Nigeria,
                        and possibly Cameroun and the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland by
                        the end of 1960. We should anticipate Missions in Uganda, French West
                        Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Madagascar and Togo within the next three
                        to five years.</p>
                    <p>4. That, because of climate, unhealthful conditions, remoteness of many
                        posts, and lack of available facilities, a special buildings program for
                        Africa be requested of Congress. (This proposal will be submitted
                        separately.)</p>
                    <p>5. That <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> together with the planning staff,
                        and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s office, study the
                        advisability of developing a multilateral aid programme for Africa, taking
                        into account the development fund of the European Common Market, the
                        Foundation for Mutual Assistance in Africa South of the Sahara (<gloss

                    <p>My final recommendation is the most important. Events are moving very rapidly
                        in Africa and the pace will quicken. Let us plan ahead, anticipate problems,

                        It covers the period from August 1957 through March 1958. This map shows in

                        powers having dependencies in the area. It should be noted that the policy
                        (paragraph 25–a) specifically prescribes “avoiding an impression in
                        presently dependent areas that the U.S. is prepared to underwrite their
                        eventual independence” and (paragraph 13–d) “cooperate with the metropolitan
                        powers … <note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                        making it clear that we are not trying to supplant the metropoles.” The
                        importance of this admonition is borne out by the report which stresses the
                        existence of metropolitan suspicion, in varying degree and form, throughout
                        the area. In places such a Nigeria where there is no white settler problem,
                        this suspicion is minimal; but in other British dependencies, such as Kenya
                        and Tanganyika, where the white settler problem is acute, it is
                        considerable. The French remain suspicious of all <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                            >USIS</gloss> activities, and the Belgians have become so suspicious of
                        all U.S. activities in the Belgian Congo that it has been necessary to
                        approach them at a high level and tell them frankly the reasons and need for
                        increased U.S. activity in Africa. The Portuguese are most bitter and
                        outspoken about their resentment of what they regard as American
                        anti-colonialism.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the report stresses the susceptibility of the racial nationalist
                        and anti-colonial sentiments of indigenous peoples to political
                        exploitation. The Communists have used the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference,
                        and its permanent follow-up, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council, as their
                        principal vehicle to exploit this susceptibility; however, their domination
                        of this conference was so blatant that they may have overplayed their hand.
                        The Communists have also used terrorist and guerrilla activities with effect
                        in the French Camerouns trust territory, and continue to exercise potent
                        influence in the African National Congress in the Union of South Africa.</p>
                    <p>They have also been able to appear effectively in some areas as champion of
                        the oppressed colonies.</p>
                    <p>The final significant aspect of the report is the economic element of the
                        Soviet and Western activities in the area. In 1957 the Soviets spectacularly
                        increased their imports from Ghana over 1956, purchasing 11.4% ($17.5
                        million) of Ghana’s total exports, as compared with 2.4% in 1956. A Soviet
                        trade mission visited Ghana last November and Ghana trade missions are
                        scheduled to visit both Communist China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> in the near future. The West has also taken effective
                        steps in the economic field, including (a) your well received reply to Prime

                        against unfavorable American press treatment. Looking ahead, the U.S. has
                        extended an official invitation to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NK2"

                    <p>Before Mr. Randall commenced to make his report, the President broke in to
                        say that Mr. Randall’s written report,<note n="1" xml:id="d4fn1">Reference
                            is to “Report to the Council on Foreign Economic Policy on U.S. Foreign

                            territories in March and April and had conferred with U.S. officials
                            stationed in several others. He submitted recommendations to the Council
                            on Foreign Economic Policy on June 13 (<gloss target="#t_CFEP1"

                        recently read, was highly to be commended to all members of the Council. It
                        was interesting, intriguing, and valuable. The President said that he was so
                        impressed with the work of missionaries, as described by Mr. Randall, that
                        he proposed to increase his contributions. In short, this was the best
                        report that the President could remember reading for a very long time.</p>
                    <p>After thanking the President for his commendation, Mr. Randall stated that
                        his visit to Africa had been a very stirring adventure. He listed briefly
                        the many countries he had visited, and noted that he had had discussions
                        with some 21 senior U.S. officials in these countries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall expressed the opinion that it would be impossible to formulate a
                        general U.S. policy covering the whole of Africa. The backgrounds of the
                        several countries were simply too different. Policy-wise, we must look at
                        Africa either country by country or area by area. It was also Mr. Randall’s
                        view that Africa South of the Sahara was one area in the world where, in
                        general, military considerations took a distinctly second place to economic
                        and political considerations in so far as the formulation of national
                        security policy was concerned.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the economic life of Africa South of the Sahara, Mr. Randall
                        stated that he was much struck, in nearly every country in Central Africa,
                        by the problem of land tenure. There were no individual holdings in fee
                        simple; land was almost universally tribally or communally owned. This lack
                        of individual land ownership was a real drawback to economic progress in
                        Africa South of the Sahara.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall pointed out that in natural resources Africa South of the Sahara
                        was potentially very rich; but actually spotty or poor in terms of the
                        current situation. After describing the specific resources in the various
                        countries and areas, Mr. Randall made a plea that U.S. capital share in
                        economic enterprises with indigenous capital. Indigenous capital was perhaps
                        the best built-in safeguard against nationalization of enterprises.</p>
                    <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0045"/>
                    <p>The greatest resource of Africa South of the Sahara consisted of
                        hydroelectric power. Indeed, this was an unbelievably great potential source
                        of power. Mr. Randall illustrated his point by listing the various dams in
                        this great region which were either in operation or being built or planned.
                        He added that in His infinite wisdom, Divine Providence had located large
                        bauxite-producing areas adjacent to most of these dams.</p>
                    <p>The greatest problem confronting Central Africa was the human problem. The
                        Spirit of 1776 was running wild throughout the area. The various states and
                        colonies want independence now, whether they are ready for it or not. In
                        some respects this phenomenon was rather terrifying, as one deduced from
                        reading the biography of <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall then made comments on the political systems and the economic
                        development of the various regions of Africa South of the Sahara. He noted
                        that the political spectrum from right to left ran from south to north
                        geographically. All of us are familiar with the situation in the Union of
                        South Africa. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> took
                        a very tragic view of the future of South Africa, the policies of whose
                        government were certainly driving it to catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>The Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique were very badly governed and
                        administered. The Portuguese authorities exploit the resources of these
                        areas mercilessly, and put very little back for future development. They
                        believe that the best way to manage the natives is to avoid educating them.
                        Forced labor was very common.</p>
                    <p>Rhodesia, thought Mr. Randall, was a very bright spot in terms of development
                        of the native African; or at least it had been until the last week or so.
                        Much credit for the progress in Rhodesia should go to the U.S. copper
                        companies situated there.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Belgian Congo, Mr. Randall said that in a conversation
                        with the Governor General,<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Leon Pétillion.</note>
                        the latter had made the point that a man must eat before he can enjoy
                        freedom. The Belgians have therefore concentrated on providing some economic
                        opportunity for the natives of the colony. Having done fairly well in this
                        field, the Belgians are now beginning to move cautiously toward greater
                        political freedom and development for the natives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall commented that for his money the French were doing the best job
                        with the political development of the Africans. There was no race separation
                        visible in French Equatorial Africa. As you move further up the coast,
                        British influence has been very good in training the natives to political
                        maturity, but the British were behind the French in this respect.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0046"/>
                    <p>This great human problem in Africa South of the Sahara, continued Mr.
                        Randall, presents the United States in general, and the <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in particular, with a dilemma that we are
                        pretty well aware of. The Metropoles do not want the United States to
                        provide any assistance to their African colonies. On the other hand, the
                        newly independent states insist on knowing where the United States stands on
                        the problem of colonialism. So we are caught on the horns of the dilemma of
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on the one hand and of a free,
                        non-Communist Africa on the other. Mr. Randall felt the time was approaching
                        when we would have to take a firm stand against colonialism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Randall was about to conclude at this point, when General Cutler asked
                        him if he had not some observations to make on Liberia. Mr. Randall replied
                        that he had, but that this was a very sensitive situation, discussion of
                        which should be kept within the walls of this room. We did face a very
                        serious problem in Africa generally because of the segregationist practices
                        of such U.S. companies as Firestone and Republic in Liberia itself. These
                        companies have not developed the African worker as they should have. The
                        situation has become so serious that the Liberian Government has passed an
                        anti-segregation law. Mr. Randall indicated that he [is] going to talk to
                        his old friend Harvey Firestone about this problem.</p>
                    <p>General Cutler inquired whether it was not true that in Liberia segregation
                        was practiced even among blacks. Did not the descendants of the original
                        slaves from the United States keep the Negroes of the bush strictly
                        segregated? Mr. Randall replied in the affirmative, and said it was a quite
                        extraordinary phenomenon.</p>

                    <p>To assess current trends in French Tropical Africa, and to estimate their
                        effects on the stability and orientation of the region over the next few
                        years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. Relations between France and its Tropical African territories are entering
                        a critical phase. Demands for political advances—stimulated in part by the
                        grant or promise of independence to other African areas—have grown so
                        rapidly since 1956 that a new French policy approach is now required if
                        these territories are to be held in a long-term association with France.
                        (Para. 8)</p>
                    <p>2. Pressures for self-government or semi-independant status have built up
                        despite the uneven political and economic development of this vastly diverse
                        region. From the economic point of view, few, if any, of the French African
                        territories—which are highly dependent upon external assistance—can become
                        self-sustaining in the forseeable future. (Paras. 11, 17, 19, 26)</p>
                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0048"/>
                    <p>3. Radical student groups and labor leaders are forcing even the more
                        moderate African leaders to make greater demands on the French. Such
                        pressures are now strongest in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trust
                        territories of Togo and Cameroun, and least advanced in the Federation of
                        French Equatorial Africa, which lags behind the West African Federation.
                        (Paras. 31–36)</p>
                    <p>4. The assumption of power by General de Gaulle could lead to a revision of
                        the French constitution in a way which would accommodate African demands
                        over at least the short term. If such a revision is accomplished, it would
                        be favorable to the maintenance of a French-African community. Should there
                        be no French constitutional reforms affecting Africa, the most likely French
                        policy would be a temporizing one which in time might provoke considerable
                        unrest, and possibly violence, in Tropical Africa. (Paras. 43–44)</p>
                    <p>5. In either case, we believe that an African nationalist drive toward
                        eventual independence will be maintained. Within a year or so France will
                        probably be forced either to recognize, or set a date for recognition of,
                        the independence of both Togo and Cameroun. Within the next three or four
                        years, it will probably be compelled to grant virtual independence to French
                        West Africa, whether as a federation or as individual territories; French
                        Equatorial Africa would probably obtain a similar status within a few
                        additional years. (Paras. 45–46)</p>
                    <p>6. There is no organized Communist party and no Bloc consular representation,
                        but Communist influence appears to be playing a minor and indirect role in
                        the area. An exception is Cameroun, where a handful of hardcore Communists
                        seem active in the outlawed terrorist UPC (Union of the Camerounian People),
                        which had a few hundred partisans. Communist influence, mainly exercised
                        through the African labor and student groups, will probably increase,
                        although not to the point where local Communists will be able to gain a
                        dominant position in the nationalist movement over the next few years.
                        (Paras. 36–38)</p>
                    <p>7. We believe that present conditions and trends in French Tropical Africa
                        are leading to a situation several years hence which could be inimical to
                        Western interests. The region will probably witness the creation of a
                        collection of weak and unstable African states, at odds with each other and
                        with their neighbors, and highly vulnerable to both internal and external
                        Communist influences. Even if close ties with the West are continued, the
                        region is likely to adopt basically neutralist policies with regard to the
                        conflict between the Soviet Bloc and the West. (Para. 52)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Discussion was first centered on the Planning Board proposals for revision of
                        the economic paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5719/1. Mr.
                        Randall said the Planning Board paper was excellent and incorporated sound
                        policy. The President asked why greater emphasis appeared to be given to
                        assisting the British and French colonies, as against the Portuguese and
                        Belgian colonies. Mr. Randall replied that the British and French colonies
                        would achieve their independence earlier than the Portuguese and Belgian
                        colonies; and that the new independent states emerging from British and
                        French rule must be oriented toward the United States. The President asked
                        how we coordinated our policies toward these colonial areas with the mother
                        countries. Mr. Randall said this was a delicate problem. Assistance to the
                        colonies was often less offensive if offered in the framework of a
                        multilateral organization, so that it appeared as a mutual effort. The
                        President remarked that it was often difficult to cultivate good relations
                        with colonies. For example, there was great concern in Paris every time the
                        United States spoke a <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0050"/>friendly word
                        to a French colony. In Africa South of the Sahara we must be careful not to
                        get ourselves hated by both the colonies and the mother countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he agreed with
                        the policy stated in the Planning Board paper. He added that under the
                        Common Market Plan $500 million had been pledged for the development of
                        Africa; and some Europeans who were expecting to get raw materials from
                        Africa wanted a slow-down of the independence movement. Mr. Randall said the
                        current tendency toward a joint effort by U.S. and U.K. private capital in
                        African development would help our relations with the metropoles. The
                        President said that rather than slow down the independence movement, he
                        would like to be on the side of the natives for once. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> thought such a policy would raise
                        delicate questions in our relations with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> partners, and Mr. Randall agreed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that there
                        were great opportunities for educational work in Africa. The President was
                        reminded of a recent movie which had stressed the theme that the black man,
                        under the influence of religion, was taking a more realistic view of his
                        problems. Mr. Randall believed a great reservoir of good will for the United
                        States was being created by the missionary movement in Africa.</p>
                    <p>The President felt we must believe in the right of colonial peoples to
                        achieve independence as we had, but agreed that if we emphasized this right
                        too strongly, we created a crisis in our relations with the mother
                        countries. Mr. Randall said the nationalist movement in Africa was strongest
                        where education and religion flourished; we must recognize that to encourage
                        education and religion is to foster independence. The President asked why we
                        could not foster education and religion, leaving the mother country to
                        prepare the colony for independence. He felt we must, however, go along with
                        the trend toward independence. Mr. Randall felt that more emphasis should be
                        placed on education in Africa; there were risks in bringing Africans to the
                        United States to be educated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that Africa was usually
                        thought of in terms of the black man, but that one area in
                        Africa—Rhodesia—was eminently suitable for white settlement and development.
                        The Prime Minister of Rhodesia<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">Sir Edgar
                            Whitehead.</note> (who had once lived in the United States) was ready to
                        open the country to immigration from all sources. Salisbury was a booming
                        town. Among the impressive projects in Rhodesia was a tremendous dam on the
                        Zambesi supplying power for copper extraction.<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4"
                            >Reference is to the Kariba Dam.</note> In reply to a question by the
                        President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said Rhodesia’s
                        access to the sea was through Mozambique.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0051"/>
                    <p>Mr. Randall said that Rhodesia was undecided whether to adopt a racial policy
                        similar to that of South Africa, or to continue its concept of racial
                        partnership. U.S. capital invested in the copper mines was one favorable
                        influence in Rhodesia.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Smith (<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>) said he had found it very
                        difficult to recruit experienced competent officials for the <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> program in Africa. He had been trying for
                        six months to recruit 26 officials for Ghana.</p>
                    <p>The President then remarked parenthetically that he was having a continuing
                        protocol discussion with the State Department, which insisted that he invite
                        half a dozen American negroes to any White House reception of a
                        distinguished African visitor. The President feared the African visitors
                        felt they were being patronized.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called attention to the
                        Planning Board proposals for revising certain military paragraphs in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5719/1, and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        views on these paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>Secretary McElroy said he agreed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        views.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said the strategic
                        importance of Africa South of the Sahara had increased since <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5719/1 was written. The deterioration of
                        the Western position in the Near East generally, in the Suez area, and in
                        North Africa, enhanced the importance of Africa South of the Sahara,
                        particularly for anti-submarine bases and air routes. Also, Africa was
                        becoming less oriented to the West and more vulnerable to Soviet subversion.
                        In the absence of countermeasures, the advance of the Soviets through the
                        Near East and down through Africa was conceivable. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> felt that the military services
                        might be helpful in these circumstances by preparing the way for the
                        establishment in Africa South of the Sahara of naval bases, air routes, and
                        guided missile sites, even though such activity would of course be
                        expensive. In any case, we needed to anticipate the next Soviet moves.</p>
                    <p>The President said he agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                            >White</persName>’s summary of the strategic importance of Africa South
                        of the Sahara, but he disagreed with the idea that U.S. military activity in
                        the area would be beneficial. Military activity is usually ineffective as
                        the first step in establishing close relations with a country so that it
                        will be on our side in an emergency. We should first work through education
                        and cultural relations, and perhaps Africa will later invite our military to
                        help with defense problems. Our military installations are useless if the
                        people don’t want them. We must win Africa, but we can’t win it by military
                        activity.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said he believed a
                        statement on the increasing strategic importance of Africa South of the
                        Sahara belonged in the paper.</p>
                    <p>The President said he too would like a statement on strategic importance put
                        in the paper. He added that bases were of great value, but we couldn’t win
                        wars unless we won the people.</p>
                    <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0052"/>
                    <p>The Secretary of Defense believed that General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1"
                            >White</persName>’s references to military activity in the area had
                        meant activity in a low key. Secretary McElroy then raised the question
                        whether such assistance as the United States provides for civil airfield
                        construction in Africa South of the Sahara should not prepare the way for
                        possible conversion of these fields to military use.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President said we must work toward a continuation of independent
                        national neutralism in Africa South of the Sahara. The President’s remarks
                        on the liabilities of military activity were in accord with his own
                        observations in Africa. The Vice President felt we should take the
                        initiative in encouraging neutralism, which the national independence
                        movements favor, instead of assuming that a neutral is on the Soviet side.
                        We should discourage open military ties with the West and encourage
                        educational and cultural ties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said the Planning Board would
                        revise the military paragraphs of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5719/1
                        to reflect the discussion.</p>

                    <p>On August 20, the Department of State announced the establishment of a Bureau
                        of African Affairs. Congress had authorized the appointment of an additional
                        Assistant Secretary of State on July 18 in P. L. 85–524 (72 Stat. 363). The
                        new Bureau consisted of the Offices of Northern African Affairs and Middle
                        and Southern African Affairs. Responsibility for Egyptian and Sudanese
                        affairs remained within the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs,
                        out of which the African Bureau was carved. Algeria continued within the
                        purview of the Bureau of European Affairs.</p>

                        PRIOR TO CALENDAR YEAR 1960</p>
                    <p rend="center">Prefatory Note</p>
                    <p>1. Many of the problems of Africa South of the Sahara are long-range in
                        nature. Appreciable progress toward their resolution will in some instances
                        require a generation or more. The policy guidance contained in this paper is
                        addressed to those actions which the United States can usefully take in the
                        immediate future. Moreover, the projection of specific policies beyond this
                        period is not feasible because of the marked political changes probable in
                        the area after 1960.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Nature of U.S. Interests</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General</p>
                    <p>2. There is a growing awareness in the world that Africa is emerging as an
                        area which will have an increasingly important influence on the course of
                        world events and that the political alignment of the present and future
                        independent nations of the continent will be deeply affected by the policies
                        which Western nations, including the United States, pursue in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>3. The United States is concerned that Africa South of the Sahara develop in
                        an orderly manner toward self-government and independence in cooperation
                        with the European powers now in control of large areas of the continent. We
                        hope that this transition will take place in a manner which will preserve
                        the essential ties which bind Europe and Africa—which are fundamentally
                        complementary areas. Africa depends on Europe not only as a source of the
                        normal imports of undeveloped countries but also as the major supplier of
                        investment, both public and private. Europe in turn needs the African
                        market, as well as Africa’s minerals and agricultural products. The United
                        States, therefore, believes it to be generally desirable that close and
                        mutually advantageous economic relationships between the European powers and
                        Africa should continue after the colonial period has passed.</p>
                    <p>4. We wish to avoid in Africa a situation where thwarted nationalist and
                        self-determinist aspirations are turned to the advantage of extremist
                        elements, particularly Communists. We also wish to avoid the deprivation of
                        African markets and sources of supply to Western Europe, and the economic
                        dislocations that could result from the termination of the social and
                        economic development programs of the metropolitan governments in the
                        dependent areas (which currently average $300 million annually in excess of
                        ordinary budget expenditures).</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Economic.</hi> American economic interests in Africa are
                        important although not to be compared with other areas. Total American
                        investment in Africa South of the Sahara is now about $500 million, the
                        majority in the Union of South Africa. The area is a predominant source for
                        the United States of such strategic materials as asbestos, cobalt,
                        columbite, corundum, industrial diamonds, tantalum ore, palm kernel oil, and
                        chemical chromite. The United States also imports many other agricultural
                        and mineral products (including uranium) from the area. Our exports to the
                        area, although limited in almost all parts of the area by governmental
                        restrictions which discriminate in favor of the metropolitan powers, are
                        important to the countries concerned. <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0056"
                        />Total U.S. trade with Africa South of the Sahara now equals more than $1
                        billion annually. It is in our interest to promote and support as
                        appropriate the sound economic development of the area, both as an end in
                        itself and as an important factor contributing to democratic political
                        evolution.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Strategic.</hi> The strategic value of Africa South of
                        the Sahara stems principally from the area’s geographic location athwart
                        alternate air and sea routes to the Far East, and from its strategic
                        materials. In the event of war or loss of Western access to sea and air
                        routes through the Middle East, control of sea and air communication through
                        Africa South of the Sahara would be extremely important. Recent events
                        increasingly jeopardize our sea and air lanes through the Middle East,
                        thereby increasing the strategic significance of Africa South of the Sahara.
                        From bases in certain areas of Africa South of the Sahara, the Communists
                        could pose a serious threat to communications in the Atlantic, the Indian
                        Ocean, and the Red Sea, as well as to our important North African strategic
                        facilities, the Mediterranean littoral, and the flank of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Therefore, under these circumstances,
                        our primary strategic interest is to deny Africa South of the Sahara to
                        Communist control.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Political.</hi> Despite the remoteness of this area from
                        the Soviet periphery, its political stability is important to the United
                        States. Many African leaders look to us to support indigenous desires for
                        self-government, and the colonial powers look to us to support their varying
                        policies. Should serious disorders develop in the area, there might be a
                        further military and economic drain on some of the more important <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers, such as has been the case in
                        Algeria. Furthermore, our major European allies would be adversely affected
                        both economically and strategically by the denial to them of Africa South of
                        the Sahara. We have, therefore, a very real interest in orderly political
                        evolution in Africa South of the Sahara.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Social and Humanitarian.</hi> The United States has a
                        long record of humanitarian work in Africa through missionary and similar
                        organizations. Much of the good reputation we enjoy results from this type
                        of activity.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Broad Lines of Present Policy</p>
                    <p>9. Our present policies, which must by the size of the area and the
                        differences in people and forms of government vary considerably from place
                        to place, are designed to encourage an orderly development of the whole area
                        based on a mutually advantageous accommodation between the forces of
                        nationalism and the metropolitan powers. This policy manifestly has its
                        limitations, but for the foreseeable future it will remain the only logical
                        and correct course of action to follow. The United States has, of course, a
                        very great interest in promoting, wherever <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27"
                            facs="0057"/>possible, the development and maintenance of the closest
                        possible mutually-beneficial political and economic relationships between
                        the emerging African peoples and the peoples of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>10. Within this framework, we are attempting to bring our influence to bear
                        through:</p>
                    <p>a. Welcoming and extending political support to new states, such as Ghana, as
                        they emerge.</p>
                    <p>b. Technical and economical assistance.</p>
                    <p>c. Working directly with the metropolitan powers, through loans to them for
                        specific projects in their African areas, participation in international
                        conferences called by the powers in question, and informal exchanges of
                        views.</p>
                    <p>d. Working through the United Nations, particularly where the Trust and other
                        non-self-governing territories are concerned.</p>
                    <p>e. Supporting and encouraging constructive nationalism and reform movements
                        in colonial areas in Africa, when convinced they are likely to become
                        powerful and grow in influence; while publicly acknowledging steps taken by
                        Western European powers toward indigenous self-government. Such support and
                        encouragement can take the form of public statements by senior American
                        officials, visits of prominent Americans to the area, an exchange of persons
                        program, and general public and private sympathy in the United States for
                        the desires of dependent peoples for a greater degree of
                        self-government.</p>
                    <p>f. Opening new diplomatic and consular posts, strengthening the staffs of
                        existing posts, and increasing leadership, educational exchange,
                        informational and cultural programs.</p>
                    <p>11. Our future policy must be guided by the fact that in the long run the
                        orientation of Africa South of the Sahara will depend on where the leaders
                        and the peoples feel their best interests lie. To a considerable extent, the
                        African is still immature and unsophisticated with respect to his attitudes
                        towards the issues that divide the world today. The African’s mind is not
                        made up and he is being subjected to a number of contradictory forces. This
                        pressure will increase in the future. The African is a target for the
                        advocacy of Communism, old-fashioned colonialism, xenophobic nationalism,
                        and Egyptian “Islamic” propaganda, as well as for the proponents of an
                        orderly development of the various political entities in the area in
                        question, closely tied to the West. The eventual political orientation of
                        the emerging African states will probably be determined by what the leaders
                        and peoples conceive best serves their own interests, measured primarily in
                        terms of “independence” and of “equality” with the white man. Our policies
                        therefore must be designed to convince the African that the United States
                        wants to help him achieve his economic, political and cultural goals without
                        insisting that he align himself in the East-West power struggle.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Major Problems and Issues</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nationalism vs. Colonialism</p>
                    <p>12. Nationalism vs. colonialism is the great issue in Africa today. At the
                        moment, all others, no matter how important, are subordinate to it. Our
                        policies in any field will be of little or no value if we ignore this issue.
                        The problem is enormously complicated and no pat answers are possible. The
                        colonial powers follow different policies, from the Portuguese to the
                        British (in West Africa) extremes. Furthermore, the peoples themselves now
                        under colonial direction are different in culture, history, race and degrees
                        of development. But sentiment and pressures for self-government are
                        everywhere increasing at an accelerated rate. Premature independence would
                        be as harmful to our interests in Africa as would be a continuation of
                        nineteenth century colonialism, and we must tailor our policies to the
                        capabilities and needs of each particular area as well as to our over-all
                        relations with the metropolitan power concerned. It should be noted that all
                        of the metropolitan powers are associated with us in the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance or in military base
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Policy Guidance:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. Support the principle of self-determination (self-government or
                        independence) consistently and in such a way as to assure that evolution
                        toward this objective will be orderly; making clear, however, that
                        self-government and independence impose important responsibilities which the
                        peoples concerned must be ready and able to discharge.</p>
                    <p>b. Encourage those policies and actions of the metropolitan powers which lead
                        the dependent peoples toward responsible self-government or
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>c. Avoid U.S. identification with those policies of the metropolitan powers
                        which are stagnant or repressive and, to the extent practicable, seek
                        effective means of influencing the metropolitan powers to abandon or modify
                        such policies.</p>
                    <p>d. As appropriate, cooperate with the metropolitan powers in the development
                        programs of their dependent territories, making it clear that we are not
                        trying to supplant the metropoles.</p>
                    <p>e. Emphasize through all appropriate media the colonial policies of the
                        Soviet Union and particularly the fact that the Soviet colonial empire has
                        continued to expand throughout the period when Western colonialism has been
                        contracting.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Racialism</p>

                    <p>17. By and large, Communism has not been a major problem in Africa South of
                        the Sahara up to the present, but its potential influence is a matter of
                        growing concern. There is a discernible Communist influence in African and
                        Indian political groups in the Union of South Africa and penetration of
                        labor unions in West Africa. African students in Europe, furthermore, are
                        assiduously cultivated by local Communists and many have been subverted.
                        Soviet pretensions to being anti-colonial and non-European tend to be
                        effective in Liberia and Ghana, and these governments are flattered by
                        Soviet attempts to cultivate them.</p>

                        Union of South Africa has the most highly developed economy of any nation in
                        the area and its economy has been growing steadily. Ghana also has made more
                        progress toward a monetary economy than most of the African areas. Ghana has
                        aspirations for large-scale development to reduce its present dependence on
                        the one crop, cocoa, which is the primary source of its present prosperity.
                        In Liberia economic growth has been rather slow, largely because of the lack
                        of education and the dependence on a subsistence economy, although
                        substantial U.S. private investment has been of assistance. Ghana and
                        Liberia, and other states as they become independent, may require investment
                        capital and technical aid—in amounts varying with their several needs—which
                        the metropolitan powers will no longer be either willing or able fully to
                        provide. Successful U.S. programs in such countries can demonstrate to
                        Africa the sincerity of our friendship and help to prevent them from falling
                        under Communist influence.</p>

                            Capabilities of the Metropolitan Powers.</hi> There is wide variation in
                        the economic potential of the dependent areas and in the capability of the
                        metro-poles for contributing to their economic development. Some of these
                        territories apparently do not possess sufficient natural resources to permit
                        substantial economic development, even if the necessary manpower and capital
                        were available. Their lack of development potential may, in the future,
                        create serious problems. Other territories have the natural resources but
                        lack technical and managerial skills. The generally low level of per capita
                        income is another factor hindering capital formation, but lack of capital is
                        not in all cases a major obstacle. With respect to the ability of the
                        metropoles to contribute to the economic development of their dependencies,
                        the Belgians appear in the best position to continue the economic
                        development of their dependent area, the Congo—a rich area in its own right.
                        Portugal has financial resources to develop its territories as rapidly as
                        the absorptive capacity of these territories will permit, but Portuguese
                        colonial policy does not call for such development. British and French
                        capabilities are limited by their internal financial difficulties. Both
                        countries have invested large amounts in economic, social and educational
                        programs in their dependent areas in Africa South of the Sahara. The extent
                        to which they will be able or willing to maintain a flow of public capital
                        to their <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0061"/>territories require further
                        study, but on the basis of preliminary analysis it appears unlikely that a
                        sufficient flow can be maintained. On the other hand the foreign exchange
                        earnings of a number of British territories and the investment program of
                        the European Common Market for French and Belgian dependent African
                        territories may also prove substantial.<note n="7" xml:id="d8fn7">

                            <p>It should also be noted that the International Bank, which has
                                outstanding loans (guaranteed by the Metropole) of $259 million to
                                dependent territories in this area, can be expected to continue an
                                active lending program. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        </note> However, the prospects for adequate economic development support
                        from the metropolitan powers will be heavily influenced by factors other
                        than their financial capabilities. One very important factor will
                        necessarily be a metropolitan power’s appraisal of the likelihood that it
                        will be able to maintain close political and economic ties with a particular
                        colonial territory. Thus our success in attaining the previously-stated U.S.
                        objectives of preserving the essential ties between Europe and Africa, will
                        probably have an important impact upon the rate of Africa’s economic
                        progress, and upon the extent of Africa’s reliance on U.S. assistance. What
                        happens to the movement of private capital, which has been a major factor in
                        the economic development of many of these territories, seems likely to be
                        determined less by the financial problems of the British and French
                        governments than by the economic opportunities offered in the territories
                        and the climate for private investment maintained by these areas as they
                        achieve independence.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>a. The lack of skills and proficiency of African manpower is a major
                        limitation on productivity and economic growth. Colonial powers and private
                        investors have made only limited attempts to meet these deficiencies by
                        formal or in-service training. Provision of entrepreneurial and managerial
                        skills will be most difficult to achieve. The African countries could be
                        developed much more rapidly if a group of managers were trained for
                        industrial establishments, Government agencies, and the other institutions
                        which are essential to a developing economy. Disease and malnutrition
                        further reduce the effectiveness of labor.</p>
                    <p>b. The problem of developing Africa is basically one of changing traditional
                        and economically primitive societies to bring them within the compass of a
                        modern economy—of increasing productivity and enlarging the exchange economy
                        at the expense of the subsistence economy.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0062"/>
                    <p>c. Most Africans depend upon agriculture for a livelihood. Small-scale
                        subsistence farming is the general rule and the individual farmer ordinarily
                        has no cash crop. Increased production, involving a shift from subsistence
                        to cash-crop farming, and diversification of crops, are of immediate
                        importance for the economic development of the area. The generally
                        prevailing system of land tenure, which does not recognize individual
                        ownership, also discourages agricultural development in many of these
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>d. The economies of some of these countries are vulnerable because they
                        depend basically upon one commodity for most of their foreign exchange.
                        Because these commodity exports are often subject to wide fluctuations in
                        price, export earnings are at times severely reduced, and because these
                        exports are preponderantly to the Free World, Africans tend to hold Western
                        industrial nations responsible for price declines.</p>
                    <p>e. While a great deal has been done to provide railroads between the main
                        urban centers, a network of roads is required to reduce the dependence of
                        these countries on subsistence agriculture, increase the labor supply,
                        expand domestic markets, and otherwise increase the rate of economic
                        development. Little has been done to develop adequate communications
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>f. Mineral exploration and development are in their infancy in parts of
                        Africa. The minerals potential of several areas may far exceed what is
                        presently known.</p>
                    <p>g. Discrimination against Africans retards development of badly needed
                        technical skills, keeps literacy and productivity at a low level, and
                        adversely affects the rate of economic growth.</p>
                    <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Multilateral Economic Organization.</hi> The
                        possibilities of a multilateral economic organization for Africa have been
                        under discussion by the metropolitan powers, particularly the British. Such
                        an organization might serve as a forum for the consideration (without
                        binding commitment) of development programs and needs of African countries
                        and of proposals for economic and technical assistance by donor
                        participating nations. The great diversity in economic problems as well as
                        in cultural backgrounds and political status among the African countries
                        might limit the effectiveness of such an organization in actual practice.
                        Moreover, the usefulness of such an organization to the United States might
                        also be affected by its relationship to other international organizations
                        and institutions, such as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Economic
                        Commission for Africa, and by the extent of its membership (e.g., whether
                        all the metropolitan powers were to participate and whether the North
                        African countries, particularly Egypt, were to be included). However, such
                        an organization might have the following advantages from the point of view
                        of U.S. interests:</p>

                        attracting maximum amounts of external private capital; and to continue to
                        look to the extent possible to Western Europe and to international
                        institutions and to private capital as the primary sources of external

                        acceptability thereof to the particular metropolitan power concerned, the
                        fact that an area is dependent upon a metropolitan power should not itself
                        serve to exclude that area from U.S. assistance programs. The priority
                        accorded to the different dependent areas and the different types of

                        to the following:</p>
                    <p>(1) Increasing agricultural productivity and, where necessary, encouraging

                    <p>(7) Development of communications systems, particularly on a regional
                        basis.</p>
                    <p>Within the above categories, the United States should seek out projects which
                        are of particular interest to the Africans or to which they attach special

                        presently extending assistance to Africa or in a position so to contribute,
                        to develop an organization to serve as a forum for the consideration
                        (without binding commitments) of the development programs and needs of
                        African countries and of proposals for economic and technical assistance by

                        establishing a new organization if existing institutions are found to be
                        inadequate to the task. U.S. participation in such an organization should
                        not alter existing practices in extending its economic and technical
                        assistance primarily on a bilateral basis.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Education and Training</p>
                    <p>26. The most urgent need by far in Sub-Sahara Africa today is for increasing
                        the facilities and raising the standards in education. More and better
                        schools and teachers are everywhere required, and at every level. Of
                        particular importance is the expansion of facilities for technical education
                        at the secondary school level. American opportunities <pb n="36"
                            xml:id="pg_36" facs="0066"/>for assistance vary with the policies of the
                        metropolitan powers concerned and the resources of the independent
                        countries. Without increased educational opportunities it is impossible to
                        expect any early advancement of most African peoples to the point where they
                        are capable of running their own affairs.</p>
                    <p>27. <hi rend="italic">Policy Guidance:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. Give special attention to education and training programs designed to
                        develop Western-oriented leaders in the area.</p>
                    <p>b. Promote and assist surveys of the educational requirements of the area,
                        including the possible desirability of an American university along the
                        lines of the existing American institutions in the Near East.</p>
                    <p>c. Expand U.S. teacher training, vocational training, and training programs
                        for public administrator, industrial managers and managerial technicians,
                        and assist in the establishment of new teacher training institutions in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>d. Assist the educational institutions in the area with teachers, books,
                        visual aid media, scholarships and the expansion of facilities, particularly
                        for technical education at the secondary level and for higher education.</p>
                    <p>e. Encourage institutions of higher education to serve multi-nation, rather
                        than national, needs and assist these institutions as feasible to that end;
                        giving priority to the two African institutions presently using American
                        methods. Encourage private U.S. foundations and educational institutions to
                        support these projects.</p>
                    <p>f. Encourage expanded support by private American institutions and
                        foundations in the field of education and encourage the further development
                        of missionary schools in the area.</p>
                    <p>g. Encourage and assist in the development of training for Americans as
                        experts in the African field.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Detribalization</p>
                    <p>28. Although detribalization remains one of the major problems of the area,
                        little positive action by the United States is possible. The tribal and
                        family traditions of the people in question are such that they remain,
                        despite the many advances that are currently being made, extremely primitive
                        in many of their social outlooks. These traditions, while breaking up at an
                        accelerated pace, remain strong, and even the urban African looks for a
                        source of authority to replace the head of the tribe or family. Until some
                        new loyalty is provided, the detribalized African will be an easy target for
                        elements eager to exploit his traditional need for leadership and
                        guidance.</p>
                    <p>29. <hi rend="italic">Policy Guidance:</hi> No immediate tangible action
                        seems possible. In general, support the work of Western-oriented labor
                        organizations, educational institutions and, in some cases, government
                        leaders in a position to influence the African looking for a new source of
                        allegiance.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0067"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cooperation Within the Area and With the Metropolitan
                        Powers</p>
                    <p>30. The Balkanization of Africa is undesirable even though full consideration
                        must be given to the vast differences found in the area. Neither the
                        metropolitan powers nor the independent states have shown any great desire
                        to work together. The issuance of invitations by the Government of Ghana to
                        the other independent African states, including those of North Africa, to
                        attend a future conference may be a beginning. Periodic secret conversations
                        between the metropolitan powers take place from time to time and are
                        increasing in frequency, although no tangible achievements are yet
                        visible.</p>
                    <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Policy Guidance:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. Encourage intra-area cooperation among all concerned in the economic,
                        scientific and cultural fields. If inter-area conferences are held, consider
                        what role the United States should play in connection with such
                        conferences.</p>
                    <p>b. As an antidote to the blandishments of Egypt and the Soviets, encourage
                        the North African states to exert influence in the area, without engaging in
                        irresponsible irredentism, if practicable in the light of our relations with
                        France.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Islam</p>
                    <p>32. Islam is spreading rapidly in Africa, although there is resistance to it
                        in those areas where all Moslems are considered Arabs and all Arabs slavers.
                        Up to the present, it has been reasonably free of anti-Western overtones,
                        but its use by the Egyptians cannot be overlooked. Islam is more attractive
                        to pagan Africans than Christianity since it is more adaptable to their
                        traditional customs (e.g., polygamy) and way of life.</p>
                    <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Policy Guidance:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. No immediate action seems warranted. Islam is not necessarily hostile to
                        the United States. On the contrary, in many areas it has proved to be a
                        strong barrier to Communism. Unless its proselytizing forces are captured by
                        hostile elements, no action by the United States would seem to be called
                        for.</p>
                    <p>b. As noted above, encourage the Moslems of North Africa to exert an
                        influence in the area as a counterweight to the Egyptians.</p>

                    <p>On October 9, Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> spoke to the Western Regional Assembly at Lake
                        Arrowhead, California, on the subject of “The United States and Africa:
                        Challenge and Opportunity.” He addressed the issue of nationalism, which was
                        a major concern of U.S. policymakers:</p>
                    <p>“Having long recognized that traditional colonialism is coming to an end, the
                        United States supports the principle of orderly transition to
                        self-government and eventual self-determination in the interests of all
                        parties and peoples involved. The speed of this evolution, we believe,
                        should be determined by the capacity of the African populations concerned to
                        assume and discharge the responsibilities of self-government.”</p>
                    <p>The growing Communist threat remained another preoccupation of government
                        leaders in Washington. To thwart “the insidious international Communist
                        force, which would deny the area to the West and ensnare it into the
                        political and socioeconomic slavery of communism,” <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> stressed the need to
                        understand and to help to meet African aspirations. He also emphasized the
                        imperative of “adequate economic and technical assistance.” For text of his

                    <p>1. The rapid pace of political developments in the area, particularly in the
                        dependent territories, has created a situation in which the United States
                        often cannot perform a decisive role in view of its desire for orderly
                        self-determination of dependent peoples on one hand and its commitments to
                        its major European allies on the other. The United States, therefore, as
                        seen in the case of Guinea<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">In a referendum held

                        in the middle of a controversy between an emerging African state and a
                        European power with each side looking to us to influence the other. U.S.
                        programs and operations being undertaken are generally still modest in scope
                        with the exception of technical and economic assistance to Liberia. <gloss

                        programs are increasing but there is still much to be done particularly in
                        the light of increasing political and limited economic activities by the
                        Soviet bloc and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> in Africa. Basic
                        development loans in areas where there is little or no African participation
                        in government, while undoubtedly of economic advantage to the country
                        concerned, are looked upon by numerous indigenous Africans, rightly or
                        wrongly, as being of primary benefit to the European interests. <gloss

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                    <p>This report concerns African Nationalism and the crisis which is developing
                        in Africa South of the Sahara; the inability of European Settler Communities
                        to adjust to Nationalist demands; the imminence of widespread and continuing
                        disorder; and steps which the U.S. can take to counter the Soviet Union’s
                        campaign to gain control of African Nationalism.</p>
                    <p>The following conclusions are based on a visit to Africa in November and
                        December. It began in East and Central Africa where I called on many African
                        Nationalist leaders, European officials and “white settlers,” and ended in
                        Accra, Ghana, where I was present at the All-African People’s (Pan African)
                            Conference.<note n="1" xml:id="d11fn1">This conference took place
                            December 8–13, 1958.</note> The purpose of this journey was to study
                        African Nationalism and the political and racial unrest which is beginning
                        to spread through colonial territories, such as Kenya, the Congo, the
                        Rhodesias and Nyasaland.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Competition for Nationalist Goodwill</p>
                    <p>In any case the moment is near when the Soviet Union will be given its
                        greatest opportunity to split the world in two, by gaining a controlling
                        influence over Africa through its Nationalist movements. Secretary
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> has frequently warned about this. But there
                        is no reason why the U.S. should not also compete for Nationalist goodwill.
                        The recommendations which follow will suggest how the U.S. can ride along
                        with the Nationalist bandwagon without actually climbing on board, or
                        without taking sides against its European allies.</p>
                    <p>These proposals may seem inadequate to meet the serious situations arising in
                        Africa but they are only meant to meet the particular point which African
                        Nationalism raises at this moment.</p>
                    <p>Here are the recommendations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation 1—The State Department should encourage
                            U.S. Embassies and Consulates to increase the number and the frequency
                            of their contacts with Nationalist leaders.</hi> The importance of this
                        could be far reaching for the U.S. Seldom have so many new states been
                        coming to life at the same time, on the same continent, under the leadership
                        of so few people. Because there is a scarcity as yet of experienced African
                        leaders, it is easy to identify and to build goodwill among the actual
                        individuals who are about to become the Prime Ministers, and the other
                        prominent citizens of their respective countries. The establishment of
                        friendly contacts with these leaders should be one of the principal duties
                        of those who represent the U.S. in Africa. Such meetings should be for the
                        important purpose of keeping up with African thinking and making friends for
                        the U.S. There can be no valid objections to this by the Colonial
                        authorities. Nevertheless, there may be a reluctance among some of our
                        representatives to undertake this kind of activity, unless they are
                        periodically prodded by the State Department.</p>
                    <p>Much valuable work in keeping direct contact with African leadership was
                        being done by the Consulates I visited in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Salisbury,
                        and Johannesburg. It was particularly true in the case of the Embassy in
                        Pretoria, in spite of the suspicious and difficult attitude of the South
                        African Government. I was told that our representatives in South Africa were
                        ahead of all other foreign representatives in making African contacts.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation 2—The State Department should dispatch a
                            representative to Africa periodically for the particular purpose of
                            calling upon various African leaders.</hi> This would give “on the spot”
                        emphasis to the State Department’s direct interest in Nationalist thinking,
                        which would be much appreciated by the Africans. It would also put
                        regularity into the contact procedure and make it easier for the Consulates
                        to <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0072"/>expand their contacts. Having
                        recently called upon many of the leading Nationalists in East and Central
                        Africa, I can report that this approach to the Nationalist movement contains
                        a gold mine of goodwill for the U.S.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation 3—Congress should be requested to make
                            additional appropriations for leader grants so that a much larger number
                            of African political leaders may be invited to the U.S.</hi> This would
                        be one of the cheapest and most effective ways to build goodwill. For less
                        than one half the cost of one Sabre Jet, a large cross section of African
                        political leaders could be invited for a short visit to the U.S., provided
                        with suitable travel escorts, and returned to Africa with some understanding
                        of American life. Under present appropriations it has not been possible to
                        invite more than a handful of political leaders. Few if any of the Prime
                        Ministers in the 12 Locally Autonomous Republics or territories of French
                        West and Equatorial Africa have ever set foot in the U.S., although most of
                        them have visited Paris. Likewise very few African leaders from the Congo or
                        from the Rhodesias or Nyasaland have visited this country. An expanded U.S.
                        program for African political visitors would compete effectively with the
                        open house program which the Soviet Union and its satellites maintain for
                        African visitors.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Recommendation 4—More forthright statements should be made
                            by the U.S. Representatives in the U.N. which would unmistakably throw
                            U.S. moral support behind legitimate Nationalist aspirations.</hi>
                        During the 1958 session of the General Assembly, the U.S. made some very
                        helpful moves toward a pro-African position on Algerian independence and on
                        the South African race issue. It is hoped that these were only first steps
                        which will be followed by further equally helpful steps in the next General
                        Assembly. Because of the intense importance which Africans everywhere attach
                        to these issues, the position of the U.S. on them has a vital bearing on
                        American prestige from one end of the continent to the other.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. has so many critically urgent problems in Europe and Asia that one
                        hesitates to emphasize others. But I believe that a dangerous crisis in
                        Africa is so close at hand that there is no time to lose any opportunity,
                        however small, to build goodwill among those who will be leading the
                        independent Africa of tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">

                            >UN</gloss> vividly impressing me with rapidly evolving revolution in
                        Africa. Troubles in Algeria, French Congo, Belgian Congo, Nyasaland and
                        Kenya are out in the open, with rumors of trouble in Angola and Mozambique.
                        Events seem to be moving faster than was thought likely six months ago.
                        While British have an evolutionary spirit, events may go too fast even for
                        British. The emotional and unrealistic attitude of French towards Algeria
                        will add fuel to the flames.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances it behooves the US to think of its own interests in
                        the African continent and the catastrophe which we would confront if Soviet
                        Communism established itself there strongly. We should try to do what we can
                        to: prevent this and to be in a position so that we will be regarded as the
                        friends of those who are coming to power in the future. It is in the long
                        range interests of our European friends that we be in this position.</p>
                    <p>I suggest therefore that Acting Secretary designate a special representative
                        who would first visit the colonial offices and then travel throughout
                        Africa, especially to the troubled areas. Algeria may well be a special
                            case.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">Telegram 773 from <gloss

                    <p>Such a mission should put us in a better position in Africa and should get us

                    <p>Almost from the outset of his return to power in France in June 1958, General
                        Charles de Gaulle raised the issue of tripartite (U.S.–U.K.”French)

                        Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> on October 31 that France desired

                        tripartite study. Africa is vital to the West. If studied from a North-South
                        viewpoint, Africa was the hinterland of Western Europe. Today Africa is
                        being penetrated by Communist agents, and is caught up in the worldwide
                        movement for premature independence. It presents grave problems if not in
                        the fighting war, in the subversive war. France has great influence and
                        interest in this continent, and it would be particularly an appropriate
                        subject to be studied together.” (Memorandum of conversation by Robert H.

                            <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested to Ambassador <persName

                    <p>The second stage of the tripartite discussions, which was to focus on Africa,
                        was scheduled for mid-April. Louis Joxe, Secretary-General of the French
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed the French Delegation. On April 15, the
                        day before formal consultations were to commence, <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45"
                            facs="0075"/>“Joxe said he contemplated that these talks should be the

                        21. At the second meeting on April 17, Joxe offered remarks on Algeria, the
                        French Community, the Maghreb, and the Sahara. The third session on April 20
                        considered Algeria, Guinea, the North African states, a British paper on
                        Africa, and arms. The final two meetings were convened on April 21. A
                        discussion of military strategy carried over into the last session, which
                        also turned to economic aid. (Memoranda of conversation by Leon Dorros,

                        economic and strategic importance of Africa to the free world. The loss of
                        North Africa to the Soviet control would outflank Europe and it was doubtful
                        whether the free world would survive such a disaster. This area contained
                        Algeria and many of the newly independent countries of Africa. So long as
                        the area remained politically stable and Western-oriented and so long as its
                        economy could be developed on sound lines the Soviet task would be much more
                        difficult. He also referred to the strategic importance of the area,
                        mentioning the French and British bases there and the United States’ own
                        Strategic Air Force bases in Libya and Morocco. If we could secure the
                        friendship and cooperation of the inhabitants of North Africa this would
                        also have a favorable influence on the political position of the West in the
                        Middle East and in Africa South of the Sahara. But, if existing tensions and
                        disagreements became worse our whole position in Africa and the Middle East
                        would correspondingly be threatened.</p>
                    <p>Africa South of the Sahara was of less immediate strategic importance but its
                        vast resources could make a major contribution to the free world and its
                        political alignment would have a definite bearing on the global balance of
                        power. In fact, its influence was already felt in the United Nations where
                        the Afro-Asian bloc often acted most irresponsibly. Ever-increasing pressure
                        was building up from those forces which wished to disrupt the traditional
                        links of Africa with the West.</p>
                    <p>There was also ever-increasing pressure for self-determination which
                        unhappily sometimes led to violence. Self-determination had loomed large in
                        all recent “Pan-African” conferences, e.g., at the African Peoples’
                        Conference in Accra. Although it could not be said that the whole of Africa
                        had been represented at Accra, the Conference undoubtedly reflected
                        articulate African opinion in the continent.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">This

                    <p>The Soviet Union is well aware of this and has already gained a foothold. For
                        example, there was the Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Committee Secretariat
                        in Cairo. This was a kind of African Cominform. The Soviet Union is also
                        engaged in an orthodox diplomatic and economic offensive in Africa. The
                        Soviets seek to establish relations with all independent states and have
                        launched a program of economic and technical assistance. They had already
                        concluded trade agreements with Ethiopia, Morocco and Guinea. They were
                        paying particular attention to nationalism and “Pan-Africanism”. Against
                        this background, the efforts of the Western Powers to help the new developed
                        areas to find themselves assumed a crucial urgency. Some great and
                        imaginative steps forward had already been taken for example in the French
                        community, Nigeria and the Belgian Congo.</p>
                    <p>Change was inevitable and it was essential that it should take place in an
                        orderly manner and in the closest cooperation with the Western powers.
                        Europe and Africa were complementary, and the closest ties must be preserved
                        after the colonial period had passed. Above all, the United States wished to
                        avoid African nationalism turning into a massive anti-European movement
                        which the Communists could exploit. The Africans were on the whole immature
                        and unsophisticated and were subject to many pressures—Communist,
                        Pan-African, Islamic—all of which made it difficult for those African
                        leaders who were Western-minded to keep their followers on the right path.
                        In the long run the native Africans would take their decisions in the light
                        of what they considered to be their own best interests and the prospect of
                        achieving equality with the white race. The United States policy was to
                        assist the native African race to attain their goals without attempting to
                        attach political or military strings to their assistance. Western policies
                        should be designed to convince the African that we want to help him without
                        involving him in the East-West power struggle. The U.S. regards the European
                        Powers as best equipped for the leading role, and is concentrating primarily
                        on economic and technical assistance plus a modest amount of military
                        assistance. We are most anxious to work in the closest cooperation with the
                        former administering powers of the newly independent areas. As regards
                        self-determination we support the process of orderly evolution. We do not
                        wish to supplant the metropolitan powers and we do not approve of the
                        headlong rush to independence. But this did not mean that we would
                        necessarily refuse support or assistance to a newly independent territory
                        especially when direct United States’ interests were involved. We would like
                        the metropolitan powers to play the primary role in those territories for
                        which they had previously been responsible. This was unfortunately not
                        always possible, and the U.S. is sometimes forced to play a larger part than
                        it would wish to.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> concluded with a reference
                        to the importance of aid for Africa both bilateral and multilateral and said
                        that he would explain United States policies in more detail at a later
                        meeting. Service representatives would continue to attend the meetings when
                        required. He hoped the exchanges would be free and frank.</p>
                    <p>M. Joxe then made a general statement. The tripartite talks had two main
                        advantages. First they provided a forum for the exchange of information. In
                        many cases the detailed exchanges could be left to the experts. Secondly,
                        the talks provided a forum in which to define, insofar as possible, a joint
                        political and strategic policy. Africa was of vital importance to
                        France.</p>
                    <p>In the world-wide political and strategic contest, Africa was both a prize
                        and a battlefield. We were not yet faced with a clear-cut plan of action on
                        the part of the Russians and their allies but there were phenomena which
                        must be studied now. The value of Africa as a prize was clear. If the
                        Communists occupied or infiltrated into too many countries we would lose the
                        Battle of the Atlantic, Europe would be in danger, our communications in the
                        Far East would be cut, and we should lose a tremendous source of raw
                        materials.</p>
                    <p>Africa was also a battlefield. We had all seen the recent <gloss

                        that the drive for independence in Africa posed very dangerous problems. In
                        1950 there had been four independent countries in Africa. Soon there would
                        be 11. The French authorities were in the throes of a revolution
                        precipitated by the French Government itself. There was a continuing
                        nationalist pressure attended by “phenomena” perhaps inevitable, which could
                        easily mean that we were going to have serious trouble with the Communists.
                        If Liberia was well-established and the transition in Nigeria was proving
                        orderly, there were other countries where the omens were less favorable.
                        Nkrumah’s nationalist and Pan-African propaganda seemed to be aiming at
                        Nigeria and Togoland. Even if Nkrumah could be contained, Guinea posed a
                        formidable problem. Guinea had rushed headlong into independence.
                        Politically, economically and intellectually it afforded a classic example
                        of a country emerging from colonialism into an acute crisis of institutional
                        growth. All the symptoms were there of a State which, if not actually
                        Communist, was drifting towards Communism. There is, first, the trend
                        towards <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0079"/>authoritarianism. The African
                        revolution contained a natural element of susceptibility to authoritarian
                        regimes: democracy cannot be created overnight. Second, there is the
                        tendency to internecine struggle between members of the ruling elite, once
                        independence was won. Third, there is the concept of the “monolithic” state,
                        of which Guinea afforded a crude example and Tunisia a subtle one. Fourth,
                        there is the economic and social transformation which overtook these
                        countries. Their idea invariably was to pass as rapidly as possible from an
                        agricultural to an industrial economy. To this end they must appeal for
                        foreign capital and technical assistance and they tended to turn to
                        countries other than their “parent” for this. Equally they had a strong
                        tendency to break what they regarded as monopolistic trade links with the
                        former administering power. This made them vulnerable to the offers which
                        the Russians, with the advantages of totalitarianism, were able to make
                        while the Western Powers were still discussing among themselves.</p>
                    <p>The youth of Africa was easily tempted by “simple” ideologies. The vocabulary
                        of African youth was becoming increasingly “Neo-Marxist” throughout Africa.
                        He himself had recently been struck by this in Morocco. The vocabulary was
                        not yet Commmunist but it contained Marxist injection. A study of the press
                        and radio suggested that this vocabulary started in the Soviet Union and was
                        relayed through Cairo and through the Indian Communist Party. In many areas,
                        and especially in the Maghreb and in new countries such as Guinea, China was
                        a subject of great interest at present.</p>
                    <p>The Communists and their associates were exploiting the atmosphere of <hi
                            rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> throughout the Continent, as they
                        were exploiting the economic and social aspirations of the Africans, the
                        neutralist urge and the wish for independence.</p>
                    <p>Until 1953 the Russians did not appear to have attached more than a secondary
                        importance to Africa, but even then <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> had been conscious of the potential importance of
                        “young countries”. And in 1958 <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                            >Khrushchev</persName> had publicly given an importance to Africa which
                        we could not afford to ignore. All sorts of “African” institutions were now
                        springing up in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the Communist bloc. And
                        during the Youth Festival in Moscow<note n="5" xml:id="d14fn5">Held July
                            29–August 12, 1957.</note> particular attention had been paid to the
                        Africans, both those who came from the continent and those who attended from
                        European universities.</p>
                    <p>The African need for economic aid presented the Communists with a growing
                        opportunity. In competing with the Communists in this field Western powers
                        were handicapped by their “liberal” economic policies. Egyptian and Sudanese
                        cotton was a case in point and now there was Guinea.</p>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0080"/>
                    <p>Then there was the problem of Communist arms deliveries, first in the Middle
                        East and now in West Africa, not to mention the smuggling of arms into
                        Algeria, which was really a separate problem. Guinea had accepted massive
                        gifts of arms from the Czechs. This is sinister because Guinea would need
                        “instructors” in the use of these new arms. Morocco was another case in
                        point. But the technique of subversion was not yet fully developed: it was
                        still in the stage of exploration and exploitation.</p>
                    <p>For France, Africa was Europe in the sense that the defense of one was the
                        defense of the other and that if we allowed this exploitation to continue
                        Europe might ultimately have its flank turned and go under. <gloss

                        insofar as it went. But it was limited and it was essential that we should

                        Africa.</p>

                        risk of duplication. He added that Admiral Denny would be explaining the

                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> repeated the French thesis
                        that tripartite discussions should not cause complications elsewhere. On the
                        contrary he argued, prior tripartite agreement in advance should facilitate
                        general agreement later. As regards a program of work he suggested that
                        there should first be a general discussion followed by a discussion of
                        individual topics of interest, including strategy.</p>
                    <p>M. Joxe endorsed M. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>’s view and
                        suggested that each participant should first expound on their particular
                        problems and responsibilities in Africa. For his part he proposed to speak
                        on:</p>
                    <p>(1) Algeria</p>
                    <p>(2) Maghreb</p>
                    <p>(3) The Sahara</p>
                    <p>(4) The French Community</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> said that this should prove
                        most helpful to the United States as we are comparatively new in the field
                        and do not have the same historic responsibilities in the area as the United
                        Kingdom and France though our objectives were the same. He would welcome an
                        expose of French views and policies, especially on Algeria. This might make
                        it easier for us to gear our policies more closely to those of the French.
                        Quite frankly this had not always proved easy in the past as we have not
                        always been clear as to what the French policy was.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Sir Harold Caccia</persName> agreed and
                        suggested that the problem of education was one of the individual topics
                        which might be considered later in addition to strategy. For example, it
                        seemed important to clear our minds on whether our efforts should
                        concentrate on education abroad or education on the spot. The economic
                        problems of Africa should also be examined. There was already a multiplicity
                        of organizations and it was doubtful whether more were needed. The real
                        problem was whether the available resources were adequate to the task.</p>
                    <p>M. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> suggested that examination
                        of economic problems in detail should be done by experts.<note n="9"

                            <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> commented that the French
                        sought “military talks to cover both present activities in Africa of the

                        29, that the French viewed military talks “as a test of the usefulness of

                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is seeking.” Kohler

                        by denying the French request and urged that exploratory talks, which would

                        in talks that could result in the involvement of the military in foreign

                            >JCS</gloss> response, dated May 22, stipulated that in areas of the
                        world not covered by security pacts involving the United States (such as

                        impossible to undertake military planning in any area without first

                        basis for U.S. military participation in the talks; that the Department of

                        estimate through 1960 the prospects for political stability in the area and

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. In West Africa, British and French colonial rule is rapidly giving way
                        before the rising demands of Africans for the recognition and dignity
                        implicit in self-government and denied by colonial status. This process is
                        facilitated by the fact that there are in West Africa no settled European
                        communities such as complicate the problem in Algeria, Kenya, and Rhodesia.
                        (Paras. 12,14–15)</p>
                    <p>2. In most of West Africa there is no strong sense of distinct nationality
                        related to the particular states of the area, all of which are characterized
                        by great ethnic and cultural diversity. Such a sense of <pb n="55"
                            xml:id="pg_55" facs="0085"/>nationality, however, has begun to develop
                        in the more advanced states, helped by the growth of mass political parties.
                        (Paras. 13, 15-17)</p>
                    <p>3. The pace of political change in West Africa is being set by the members of
                        a very small educated elite, who have enlisted mass support through the
                        organization of political parties and labor unions. An essential
                        characteristic of most parties is personal loyalty to a leader; the trend is
                        toward the domination of particular states by a single party. The result is
                        a highly personal and authoritarian style of government, which is regarded
                        by the leaders as necessary to achieve unity and development in the face of
                        ethnic diversity and economic backwardness. We foresee little chance of a
                        trend away from authoritarian methods; in fact, as their problems become
                        more complex many leaders will probably become more vigorous in their use of
                        these methods. (Paras. 13, 20-22)</p>
                    <p>4. African leaders generally realize that they will need external aid in
                        order to achieve the economic development required to meet the rising
                        expectations of their people. Many, however, expect that after independence
                        economic aid will be forthcoming from a wide variety of sources. All wish to
                        maintain economic ties with the former colonial powers, but on achieving
                        independence will seek additional economic aid from both the US and the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc. (Paras. 18-19, 39-40, 42)</p>
                    <p>5. Within West Africa, there is a tendency toward interstate cooperation and
                        a strong emotional attachment to African solidarity. The various schemes
                        advanced to achieve these ends range in content from combinations to
                        maintain common public services, through loose political alliances among
                        like-minded leaders of separate states, to plans for federal union. The
                        union of Senegal and Soudan in the Mali Federation<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d17fn2">Mali was the name of a kingdom which dominated much of
                            West Africa during the 14th and 15th centuries. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> has real political substance. The Gharra-Guinea union is
                        more in the nature of an alliance of independent states in the spirit of
                        Pan-Africanism, which aspires to the liberation and unity of all Africa.
                        This loose association of states may grow, but is not likely to become an
                        organic union. (Paras. 26-31)</p>
                    <p>6. The outlook for internal political stability varies greatly from country
                        to country. Ghana is likely to remain stable and relatively prosperous.
                        Guinea’s prospects are less certain: Sekou Touré is a popular leader and
                        operates an effective political machine, but is in urgent need of technical
                        and financial assistance. Nigeria may emerge as the strongest state in the
                        area, but the extent to which it realizes this potential will depend on the
                        ability of its leaders to overcome the divisive tendencies which hamper the
                        development of national unity.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0086"/>
                    <p>Both Togo and Cameroun will probably remain stable until independence is
                        attained in 1960, but thereafter their prospects are uncertain. (Paras.
                        32–36)</p>
                    <p>7. Whether the territories of West Africa which have recently chosen to
                        remain in the French Community<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">Mauritania,
                            Senegal, Soudan, Ivory Coast, the Voltaic Republic, Dahomey, Niger,
                            Chad, the Central African Republic, the Congo Republic, and Gabon.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> continue to do so, will depend
                        largely on French willingness to satisfy African aspirations for increased
                        political stature, and on the leaders’ own evaluation of the economic value
                        of such relationship. The Mali Federation (Senegal and Soudan) is already
                        pressing for greater autonomy within the Community. If it does not receive
                        satisfaction, it will probably declare its independence. There is no strong
                        drive for early independence on the part of the other states of the
                        Community, but the secession of Mali would have an unsettling effect. The
                        Community is not likely to endure unless the French permit it to evolve into
                        an association of independent states. (Paras. 37-38; Annex 29)</p>
                    <p>8. Despite the socialistic and, in many respects, authoritarian outlook of
                        many of the leaders in the area, communism has not become a strong force in
                        West African internal politics. There are no known Communist parties in the
                        area. Nevertheless, Communist influence is likely to grow as the Sino-Soviet
                        Bloc establishes diplomatic and economic relations with the newly
                        independent states of the area. Given the generally unproven character of
                        the political institutions in the area, the situation in some countries,
                        e.g., Guinea or Cameroun, could develop in such a way as to facilitate a
                        substantial expansion of Communist influence. However, the West African
                        leaders are now in effective control in their countries, are jealous of
                        their new-found power, and would react strongly to prevent any element not
                        under their control from gaining a position of political importance.
                        Although Communist influence could increase significantly in one or more
                        countries of the area, we believe it unlikely that the Communists will
                        achieve a position from which they could control the policy of any West
                        African state during the period of this estimate. (Paras. 23-25)</p>
                    <p>9. For the next few years at least, the main thrust of Sino-Soviet Bloc
                        policy toward West Africa will probably be to establish a position as the
                        disinterested supporter of West African independence against the
                        “imperialist” powers. Accordingly, the Bloc will probably play down the
                        internal subversion of independent African states. In general, we believe
                        that the Bloc will make considerable progress in establishing its presence
                        in an area from which, in effect, it has hitherto been barred. (Para.
                        40)</p>
                    <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0087"/>
                    <p>10. The West African leaders will continue to be preoccupied with local and
                        African problems. They will react to the policies of other countries
                        primarily in terms of the real or fancied repercussions of these policies on
                        their own particular interests and on African aspirations in general. Their
                        attitude in international political affairs will be one of nonalignment with
                        either great power bloc. (Para. 43)</p>
                    <p>11. Beyond 1960, the West African countries are likely to be faced with
                        developments which will jeopardize internal stability and enhance Communist
                        opportunities for subversion. As the younger leaders begin to crowd the
                        present political leadership, political discontent will build up. But
                        because of the present leadership’s intolerance of opposition, much of this
                        political discontent will probably lead to conspiratorial activity—an
                        environment in which Communist talents are most effectively applied. (Para.

                        especially with respect to the prospects for self-government or

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. Most of the territories of East, Central, and South Africa have been
                        caught up in the continent-wide process of postwar economic, social and
                        political change, in which growing black African pressure for equality and
                        self-government is a central element. In contrast to West Africa, however,
                        accommodation to this pressure is complicated in many cases by the presence
                        of a well-entrenched white settler element and of large, though as a rule
                        politically less important, Asian or other minorities. (Paras. 9-10)</p>
                    <p>2. Over the next several years, Portugal will probably be able to control
                        whatever African unrest and agitation may develop in Angola and Mozambique.
                        For at least the next five years the whites of the Union of South Africa
                        will almost certainly continue to dominate the nonwhite elements of the
                        population—although the Nationalist government’s policy of apartheid will
                        lead to increasing nonwhite resort to <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0089"
                        /> boycotts, strikes, and passive resistance, marked by sporadic violence,
                        and will increase the likelihood of an eventual racial explosion. (Para. 23;
                        Annex A, Paras. 28–37)</p>
                    <p>3. In most other parts of the area, the next few years will be marked by
                        intensified political maneuver and negotiation and at least occasional
                        disorder and violence. Prospects for reconciliation of African, white
                        settler, and metropolitan interests vary greatly from territory to
                        territory, with much likely to depend not only on a variety of local
                        circumstances, but also on the resourcefulness and adaptability of
                        individual leaders and officials. In general, however, it appears likely
                        that at least one and perhaps as many as four or five of the presently
                        dependent territories will become independent within the next five years.
                        (Paras. 24-25)</p>
                    <p>4. Tanganyika is well on the way to self-rule under a strong African
                        political movement which has obtained white and Asian support. Rapid
                        progress toward self-rule is also likely in the Belgian Congo, where the
                        white settler element has little influence, and in the tiny protectorate of
                        Zanzibar, where some accommodation between the traditionally dominant Arab
                        minority and the increasingly active African majority appears probable.
                        There is no significant racial problem in Uganda; although the retention of

                        perpetuated tribal and sectional divisions, it is likely that the territory
                        will achieve self-government within five years. In the Belgian-administered
                        Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, and in the British-run High Commission
                        Territories, development of local self-government will also take place,
                        although at a slower pace. (Annex A, Paras. 2-5, 20–24,13,10–12, 25, 38)</p>
                    <p>5. The outlook in the remaining territories of the area is more uncertain.
                        Because of the growing strength of African pressures, Kenya may emerge as an
                        African-led state within five years, but white settler resistance and
                        African reluctance to compromise will probably lead to further bloodshed
                        before a solution is achieved. Controversy over the constitutional status
                        and racial policies of the self-governing Federation of Rhodesia and
                        Nyasaland will not be finally resolved in the constitutional review
                        scheduled by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for late 1960. Within the
                        next five years, African pressures will probably result in Nyasaland’s
                        breaking away from the Federation. In any event, unless the dominant white
                        element greatly liberalizes its “partnership” concept, the Federation will
                        probably find itself eventually in a position similar to that of South
                        Africa. (Annex A, Paras. 6–9,14–19)</p>

                    <p>6. Even in those territories where the transition to independence occurs
                        without undue disruption, the outlook for stability and orderly development
                        is generally unpromising. Grave problems of tribal disunity and backwardness
                        will confront the new African leaders, who are few in number and have
                        generally had less administrative experience than their counterparts in West
                        Africa. Moreover, the adjustment of political, economic, and social
                        relationships among the different racial groups will remain a major problem
                        long after the constitutional formalities are agreed on. (Para. 26)</p>
                    <p>7. The economic outlook also furnishes grounds for pessimism. Most of the
                        East and Central African territories are highly vulnerable to fluctuations
                        in world commodity prices. Economic growth at the rapid postwar rate is not
                        likely to continue. As African rule approaches, several territories face the
                        possibility of a decline in the rate of new investment and an exodus of
                        white managers and technicians. The new governments of the area will almost
                        certainly seek financial assistance from the US, as well as from their old
                        colonial rulers and international lending agencies. (Paras. 27–28)</p>
                    <p>8. Communist and Bloc influences are thus far negligible in East and Central
                        Africa and, at least over the next few years, we consider it unlikely that
                        such influence will reach major proportions. Despite the increased
                        opportunities for Communist political and economic penetration which are
                        likely to arise, the African leaders who have emerged thus far—unlike many
                        other Afro-Asian leaders—are essentially non-Marxist in their background and
                        will probably look primarily to the West for sympathy and support. In the
                        Union of South Africa, however, Communists already exercise a highly
                        important influence among nonwhite political movements and will almost
                        certainly continue to do so. (Paras. 29-31)</p>

                        northern and western portions of Africa, the diverse territories extending
                        from Kenya, Uganda, and the Belgian Congo southward to the Cape of Good Hope
                        constitute the last major area of white rule on the continent. Most of these
                        territories have been caught up in the continent-wide process of economic,
                        social, and political change. As elsewhere, growing pressure for economic
                        and social equality and for an effective voice in government is being
                        exercised on behalf of the black African majority by a small group of young

                        mass support. In contrast to West Africa, however, the situation is
                        complicated by the presence, in most of the territories concerned, of a
                        small but well entrenched white settler minority together with politically
                        less significant Asian or other minorities.</p>
                    <p>10. There are in the area only 3.8 million whites (or Europeans)<note n="4"

                            Population Statistics. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The Union
                        of South Africa accounts for 3 million of the whites and 1.8 million of the
                        other non-Africans. Outside the Union the white population exceeds five
                        percent of the total only in Southern Rhodesia. In most instances the
                        proportion of whites is much smaller. Nevertheless, the whites occupy a
                        dominant social and economic position, which is usually reinforced by
                        various forms of racial discrimination. The result has been the creation of
                        potentially dangerous racial tensions which complicate the process of
                        evolution from colonial status. Particularly in the several territories
                        under British control, the colonial authorities, in their efforts to insure
                        orderly development, are caught between black African pressures for equality
                        on the one hand and the efforts of the white settlers to maintain their
                        privileged position on the other.</p>
                    <p>11. Even apart from the Union of South Africa—a modern nation of farms,
                        mining, and industry lying almost entirely in the temperate zone—the area
                        considered in this estimate is one of great geographic, ethnic, and economic
                        diversity. Flanked by humid coastal plains, the high central plateau which
                        forms the bulk of the central and southern African land mass includes
                        tropical rain forests, the highlands which have attracted white settlers to
                        Kenya and the Rhodesias, snow-covered mountains, and vast deserts. The
                        African population itself includes hundreds of tribes with differing customs
                        and ways of life. Although mostly of Bantu stock, the Africans differ in
                        physical characteristics. In the economic sphere, modern towns, farms, and
                        mining enterprises are springing up against a background of primitive
                        agriculture, herding, and hunting.</p>
                    <p>12. The African population of this area is poorly prepared for
                        self-government. Despite the spectacular postwar quickening of economic
                        activity in such places as the copper belt of Northern Rhodesia and the
                        Belgian Congo, most Africans still live the primitive life of the
                        hinterland. Tribal loyalties and jealousies continue to play a major
                        political role throughout the area, thereby handicapping the efforts of
                        African leaders to develop unified political movements and provoking
                        sometimes violent intertribal conflicts. Historically, Africans of this area
                        have had less sustained contact with outside civilizations than those of <pb
                            n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0092"/> West Africa and, with some notable
                        exceptions, are less advanced culturally. More recently, the
                        near-monopolization of trade by Asians and other non-Africans, and the
                        repressive practices of the whites, have generally given the Africans less
                        opportunity than their counterparts in other areas of the continent to
                        develop the business, professional, and administrative experience which
                        would prepare them for self-government. Although literacy is growing, the
                        number of Africans with secondary level education is still small, the number
                        with a university education minute.</p>
                    <p>13. Nevertheless, African pressure for political equality has now assumed
                        major proportions through most of the area. In Angola and Mozambique, to be
                        sure, the Portuguese have been able to stave off trouble by repressing
                        political activity by either African or non-African residents and by some
                        measures for cultural assimilation. In the independent Union of South
                        Africa, African (and other nonwhite) agitation for political change has been
                        severely restricted. In most other places, however, significant mass
                        pressures, centering among the detribalized Africans of the towns and
                        minefields but in some cases extending well back into the tribal hinterland,
                        have already emerged. The British Government has long since realized that in
                        Central and East Africa, as elsewhere, the end of the colonial era is fast
                        approaching; over the past few years it has become deeply involved in
                        efforts to work out transitional constitutional arrangements which would be
                        acceptable to the various interest groups concerned. Even before the
                        Leopoldville riots of January 1959, the Belgian Government had recognized
                        that there was also urgent need to prepare for independence in the
                        Congo.</p>

                    <p>14. African nationalists are pressing for the transfer of political power to
                        Africans in most territories in the area. The strength and character of this
                        pressure vary with local conditions and with the outlook of the individual
                        leaders. A few are primarily tribal leaders intent on advancing tribal
                        interests. The most prominent, however, are a small group of confident young
                        men, some of them educated in Western Europe, who by dint of considerable
                        organizing and oratorical ability have placed themselves at the head of mass
                        movements and are regarded by their predominantly uneducated followers with
                        something akin to reverence. These men look upon themselves as the molders
                        of a modern Africa of nation-states, in which tribal divisions will
                        disappear and the African slogan of “one man, one vote” will become a
                        reality.</p>
                    <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0093"/>
                    <p>15. At present most nationalist leaders in this part of Africa are moderate
                        in approach and well-disposed by education (and sometimes by religion)
                        toward the West. They generally recognize that most of their followers are
                        motivated primarily by the hope of ending real or imagined economic and
                        social grievances rather than by any clearly perceived political goals and
                        that evolution toward independence is a complicated process in which white
                        cooperation could be valuable. Although they have pressed hard for early
                        independence when feasible, they have adapted their tactics to
                        circumstances. In the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, for example, the
                        African leaders actually favor a continuation of British supervision as a
                        protection against white settler dominance. Despite the extreme language of
                        many of their demands, most of them have sought to avoid violence except as
                        a last resort; except for certain South African leaders, none is a known
                        Communist. Nevertheless, they are a determined group with a strong sense of
                        mission. In the face of resistance to their demands, they will seek to
                        increase the pressure.</p>
                    <p>16. The firmness of the East and Central African leaders is likely to be
                        further strengthened by their growing ties both with other African leaders
                        and with each other. A significant move in this direction was the
                        establishment in September 1958 of the Pan-African Freedom Movement of East
                        and Central Africa by nationalist leaders from Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika,
                        Zanzibar, and Nyasaland. The official goal of the organization is
                        “government of Africans by Africans, for Africans, on Pan-African
                            lines.”<note n="6" xml:id="d18fn6">Nyerere and Mboya were the leading

                        this area. The Conference also established regular channels for cooperation
                        between African leaders throughout tropical Africa and led to provision of

                    <p>17. The white settler element is almost universally opposed to African
                        nationalism and to social contacts between races. Many of the settlers are
                        second or third generation residents—or in South Africa descendants of even
                        earlier immigrants—and they have a strong attachment to the lands they hold.
                        They usually feel that the hard work, skill, and capital which they have
                        devoted to building up Africa gives them the right to retain a dominant
                        position. Most of them consider the Africans manifestly incapable of
                        shouldering full economic and <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0094"/>
                        political responsibility at present and are often skeptical about the
                        African’s ability ever to throw off his primitive heritage and earn full
                        equality with the whites. Many feel that white supremacy and a strongly
                        enforced social and economic color bar are the only ultimate barriers to
                        miscegenation.</p>
                    <p>18. However, the solidarity of the white position has been weakened in recent
                        years. In the independent Union of South Africa, to be sure, the large white
                        minority, under Nationalist leadership, is stubbornly attempting to press
                        ahead with a policy of apartheid—in effect, maximum social and residential
                        segregation and preservation of the dominant white position in political and
                        economic life. In the colonial areas, however, the white settler tactic is
                        one of delay: to resist African nationalism where feasible but to concede to
                        it where necessary.</p>
                    <p>19. The largely self-governing Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (and
                        especially Southern Rhodesia, with its quarter of a million white settlers)
                        rejects apartheid in favor of a vaguely defined “partnership.” However, the
                        white Federation leadership is removing racial restrictions very slowly and
                        is accepting only a few carefully screened Africans as limited political
                        partners. Indeed, the whites are seeking increased powers and early dominion
                        status in order to deal with African pressures from a position of greater
                        strength. Elsewhere—including even Kenya with its “white highlands” and
                        memories of Mau Mau—there is growing realization that some concessions must
                        be made. In some cases efforts are being made to develop multiracial
                        parties. These tendencies toward accommodation may be strengthened by the
                        existence, even in South Africa and the Federation, of small liberal groups
                        who might serve as a bridge between the races, and by the presumed desire of
                        mining companies and other economic interests to avoid serious unrest. In
                        general, however, white willingness to accept greater African political
                        participation remains grudging. White proposals for legislative and
                        executive representation for the major racial groups fall far short of the
                        African goal of “one man, one vote.”</p>
                    <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Other Influences</hi>. Various other political forces,
                        local and external, exercise some limited influence on the situation. The
                        Asian and other nonwhite minorities of East Africa have given some valuable
                        support to African leaders, although they are often divided among themselves
                        and primarily interested in preserving their position as shopkeepers and
                        entrepreneurs in the face of African and white distrust. African nationalism
                        is strengthened by the example, advice and material help provided by
                            <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and other West African
                        leaders, with whom contacts are increasing. <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> pressure on behalf of the Africans, though flatly rejected
                        by South Africa, is a factor the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                        Belgium must take into account. Nasser has achieved some limited influence
                        in the area through propaganda and financial support to <pb n="65"
                            xml:id="pg_65" facs="0095"/>certain groups, but this influence is
                        probably declining. India’s similar appeal as a champion of anticolonialism
                        and as an Afro-Asian leader is reduced by its identification with local
                        Asians, who are not held in high esteem. Communism is not now significant
                        except among the nonwhites of South Africa.<note n="7" xml:id="d18fn7">For

                    </p>
                    <p>21. The position of the British Government, forced to deal with these
                        conflicting pressures over a broad range of local circumstances, is
                        particularly difficult. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> recognizes the
                        basic legitimacy of African aspirations for political participation and,
                        except for some reluctance to loosen its control over Kenya (which it wishes
                        to use as a military staging area and an emergency naval base site), is
                        attempting to prepare its territories for early independence through
                        progressive enlargement of the African and other nonwhite role in local
                        government. However, the Conservative government has clearly been reluctant
                        to clash with the white leaders of Kenya and of the Federation, even at the
                        cost of heavy attack from the more pro-African Labor and Liberal opposition.
                        It has resisted demands that it provide timetables for independence.</p>
                    <p>22. Belgium has now abandoned its once vaunted program for avoiding political
                        unrest by stressing African social and economic advancement and severely
                        limiting local participation in administration by either blacks or whites.
                        In January 1959 it promised to provide a gradual transfer of power to
                        elected African representatives and eventual independence for the Congo. All
                        the major Belgian parties contain groups favoring fairly rapid progress.
                        However, there are also many who favor a relatively slow and methodical
                        transfer of power.</p>
                    <p>23. Portugal has sought to insulate its African territories against
                        unsettling political influences. Angola and Mozambique are legally provinces
                        of Portugal, and Portuguese citizens there—including the some 35,000 African
                        assimilados who have qualified for citizenship—theoretically have certain
                        democratic rights. In practice, however, the centralization of power at the
                        national level and the authoritarianism of the Salazar regime prevent any
                        meaningful local political activity by either blacks or whites. In addition,
                        Portugal’s own poverty and its tendency to follow mercantilist economic
                        policies have served to retard economic development and the training or
                        education of the mass of Africans.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III Outlook</p>
                    <p>24. The next few years are likely to be turbulent, marked by intensified
                        political maneuver and negotiation and at least sporadic disorder and
                        violence. Although security forces on the scene, or those readily available,
                        will probably be able to localize and control most disturbances without
                        great difficulty,<note n="8" xml:id="d18fn8">See Annex ? for an assessment
                            of security forces. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> violence may
                        in some cases continue for fairly long periods.</p>
                    <p>25. Prospects for resolution of the struggle over independence and African
                        self-government vary widely from one territory to another, not only because
                        of the great variations in existing local circumstances but also because so
                        much will depend on the resourcefulness and adaptability of the local
                        leaders and colonial officials concerned. In general, however, it appears
                        likely that at least Tanganyika and perhaps as many as three or four other
                        territories will achieve their independence within the next five years.<note
                            n="9" xml:id="d18fn9">See Annex A for a territory-by-territory
                            assessment of the local situation and prospects. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> Advances in one territory will inevitably increase the
                        pressure for change in others. Cooperation among the African nationalist
                        movements of the area will continue but will probably not give rise to any
                        significant moves toward federation, at least during the next few years.</p>
                    <p>26. Even if the transition to independent self-government occurs without
                        bloodshed or upheaval, the outlook for stability and orderly development in
                        East and Central Africa is generally unpromising. The adjustment of
                        political, economic, and social differences among Africans, whites, and
                        others cannot be accomplished by an agreement concerning independent
                        self-rule. As elsewhere in Africa, the new governments will face staggering
                        problems of overcoming disunity and backwardness. These will place heavy
                        burdens on an African leadership which is unusually small in numbers and has
                        had little or no administrative experience. Should there be an abrupt
                        falling off of white participation in government and administration, the
                        problems would be compounded. In view of these circumstances, the conduct of
                        government is likely to become increasingly authoritarian, even though a
                        facade of parliamentary forms is maintained.</p>
                    <p>27. The economic outlook also furnishes grounds for pessimism. The rapid
                        economic development of the postwar period has only partially offset the
                        backwardness of the area.<note n="10" xml:id="d18fn10">See Annex D, Trade
                            and Estimated Per Capita Income. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                        Indeed, by bringing more and more Africans into the money economy, and thus
                        making the welfare of larger portions of the population dependent on world
                        market prices for a few primary products, this development has added a <pb
                            n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0097"/> new element of uncertainty to the
                        situation. Cyclical and other economic fluctuations, such as the post-1955
                        fall in world copper prices, are almost certain to have serious economic and
                        (in all probability) political repercussions. In general, moreover, it is
                        unlikely that during the next 10 years the favorable terms of trade enjoyed
                        by primary producing countries in the early 1950’s will return.</p>
                    <p>28. At a time when the new governments concerned will need funds to construct
                        roads, schools, and other basic improvements, there is likely to be a
                        reduction of the financial assistance previously provided by the metropoles.
                        There may be an even more serious decline in private domestic and foreign
                        investment. In many cases, moreover, there is inadequate usable land and few
                        known and readily exploitable mineral or other resources to attract
                        investment. Under these circumstances, the emerging local governments of
                        East and Central Africa are likely to expect economic assistance from the US
                        and other foreign governments as well as from their former colonial rulers
                        and from international agencies such as the International Bank for
                        Reconstruction and Development. Like other emerging independent states, they
                        will probably feel that the West is obliged to provide such assistance,
                        without particular regard to the economic merits of the situation.</p>
                    <p>29. In the colonial portions of the area, where communism is thus far a
                        negligible factor, the advance of African nationalism will almost certainly
                        provide increased opportunity for Communist and Sino-Soviet Bloc
                        penetration. Should the African drive for power lead to a protracted bitter
                        struggle, the Bloc might be able to provide much-needed moral and material
                        support to the nationalists. After independence is achieved, internal
                        instability and the need for external economic assistance will almost
                        certainly further openings.</p>
                    <p>30. At least over the next few years, however, we consider it unlikely that
                        Communist and Bloc influence will reach major proportions in East and
                        Central Africa. Wherever colonial and white settler rule persists, the
                        authorities will almost certainly continue their present restraints on
                        Communist activity. Moreover, the principal African leaders are
                        Western-educated and Western-oriented men whose general background, unlike
                        that of many other emerging Afro-Asian leaders, is primarily non-Marxist. At
                        least during the period of transition to independence, they will probably
                        tend to avoid actions which would jeopardize their chances of obtaining
                        public and official support from the US or other Western countries, or which
                        would provide the colonial authorities with additional reasons for delaying
                        political concessions. Moreover, they will probably be anxious to avoid
                        encouragement of political influences which might eventually compete with
                        their own.</p>
                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0098"/>
                    <p>31. However, communism is likely to remain a highly important influence in
                        the Union of South Africa, despite the recent development of a vocal
                        anti-Communist opposition within the major African political movement. The
                        Communists have already gained control of the national headquarters of this
                        movement. They have less influence at the provincial and local levels but
                        have achieved substantial penetration. They also dominate the most important
                        Asian political group, and are active among the “colored” (or racially
                        mixed) element. Despite the vigorous efforts of the government to crack down
                        on communism and the inclination of many African leaders in the Union to
                        reject communism as an alien philosophy, the government’s repressive
                        policies will force nonwhite political movements to continue to use
                        conspiratorial methods and extremist pressure tactics and to make common
                        cause with the Communists.</p>

                    <p>After mutual greetings and welcome by the President, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny
                        said that before his departure for New York (where he is acting head of the
                        French Delegation to the U.N.), President <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> and his African colleagues unamiously agreed that he
                        should try to meet the President of the United States. He then described to
                        the President the heavy responsibility he had had in the formation of the
                        Community, since at the time the new French Constitution <pb n="69"
                            xml:id="pg_69" facs="0099"/> was being drafted, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had invited him to be a member of
                        the drafting Committee which eventually wrote the new French Constitution.
                        He recalled that since 1956 he had been a Cabinet Minister in the various
                        French Governments which succeeded one another until the proclamation of the
                        Fifth Republic.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Houphouet-Boigny then explained in detail to the President the workings
                        of the Community and the advantages it brought to the former French African
                        Territories. One of the principal advantages of belonging to the Community,
                        he said, was that it was under the protection of the French Army (in which
                        the African states participate) and that, therefore, the African states’
                        meager resources did not have to be tapped for defense purposes. Another
                        great advantage was that in belonging to a larger entity its economic and
                        social development would proceed within a Western framework. Communism is
                        excluded from the Ivory Coast, said Mr. Houphouet-Boigny, and even
                        badly-needed technicians sent by France are not admitted if they are
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Houphouet-Boigny continued by saying that this evolution from colonialism
                        to the Community had been achieved—and must continue to be achieved—by a
                        gradual abolition of the French superiority complex together with a
                        corresponding abolition of the African inferiority complex. If the French
                        and the Germans are able to bury the hatchet and work together after a
                        series of bloody wars, there is no reason why Africans and French cannot do
                        the same thing.</p>
                    <p>With reference to Pan-Africanism, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny said that such a
                        concept was Utopian and only a useful propaganda device. He stated that his
                        principal fears lay in the so-called Afro-Asian bloc because Asia has
                        nothing tangible to offer Africa in its quest for social and economic
                        improvement. The future of Africa is with the West, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny
                        emphatically stated. Asia with its overpopulation is attempting to solve its
                        economic problems by utilizing its masses. On the other hand, Africa, which
                        is underpopulated, cannot follow this path and must rely on machines and
                        tools. It is looking for the means to finance these needs and, therefore,
                        turns to France, Europe and the West. Without them Africa would be isolated
                        and the prey of economic and ideological submission to Asia. France has done
                        and is still doing a great deal, but assistance must come from other areas
                        of the West as well. Therefore, he and the other African members of the
                        Community are looking to the United States to help keep Africa with the
                        West.</p>
                    <p>The case of Guinea is an example of the meaning of his appeal, said Mr.
                        Houphouet-Boigny. Communism is trying to get established in this country
                        through Russia and the Satellites and thereby to make Guinea a showcase of
                        communism in Africa. Although he completely understands the motives of the
                        United States in granting aid to <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0100"
                        />Guinea, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny asked that the United States not lose sight
                        of the larger aspects of the Community, which is Western-minded.</p>
                    <p>In replying to Mr. Houphouet-Boigny both during and at the end of the
                        conversation, the President agreed wholeheartedly with him that the larger
                        entities in Africa cooperating closely with the West were far preferable to
                        a series of small independent states; the President also agreed that
                        continent-wide federations could not be achieved at this time.</p>
                    <p>With regard to United States aid to Guinea, the President explained that we
                        did not want to see that country entirely committed to the communist bloc
                        and be made a showcase for communism. With regard to Western aid to Africa,
                        the President recalled his conversations last July with President <persName

                            the compilations on relations with those countries.</note> during which
                        it had been agreed that one nation alone should not carry the burden to help
                        develop newly independent countries. All must cooperate, the President said.
                        The President said that although France has a direct interest in the
                        Community and although America’s interest in Africa is somewhat scattered,
                        he wanted to assure Mr. Houphouet-Boigny that whenever feasible and
                        practical the State Department would consider with the greatest sympathy any
                        problems of the Community.</p>
                    <p>In closing, the President congratulated Mr. Houphouet-Boigny on his
                        determination to keep communism out of Africa, his broad outlook in
                        preferring a close association between Africa and the West, and for his
                        inspired personal leadership. The President also recalled with appreciation
                        the gift of the baby elephant which was presented to him some time ago in
                        the name of the Community.<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">The President met with

                        French in North Africa. This memorandum is designed to complete the picture
                        in highlighting a few of the problems we have with the French in Africa
                        South of the Sahara. In this area the principal French complaint has been
                        that we have been too friendly towards President Sekou Touré of Guinea who,
                        they maintain, is a Communist and that we have turned “deaf ears" to Prime
                        Minister Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and President Tsiranana of the
                        Malgache Republic in their advocacy of the French Community.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d20fn2">On November 21, French Minister Claude Lebel presented
                            the Department with a list of complaints about U.S. policy in Africa.
                            Telegram 2234 to Paris, November 25, which summarized the conversation,
                            stated that Lebel felt this indicated a “global U.S. policy of replacing
                            France in North and Black Africa.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                            770.00/11-2559)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Traditionally, French policies in their areas of influence South of the
                        Sahara have been notably more liberal and sympathetic than in North Africa,
                        the Levant or the Far East. With the exception of the 1947 uprising in
                        Madagascar and the 1950 Communist inspired riots in the Ivory Coast, there
                        has been no violence of any importance in the relations of France with its
                        African territories. The ratissage and similar acts of force are unknown in
                        this part of Africa. France since the close of World War II has steadily
                        advanced the African territories through a series of constitutional stages
                        to the point where they are now self-governing and free to leave the
                        Community whenever they wish.</p>
                    <p>Largely as a result of personality clashes between Sekou Touré and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>, Guinea voted “No” in
                        the last year’s referendum and left the French Community. The French
                        forthwith removed all traces of their former activities, including
                        technicians, equipment, security forces, files and funds and left Guinea an
                        easy target for Soviet Bloc penetration. The French have consistently
                        maintained the <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0102"/> position that Guinea
                        should be treated as a pariah and that the United States should do nothing
                        whatsoever to counter Communism in that country.</p>
                    <p>Although General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s personal
                        dislike of and pique at Sekou Touré remain factors in this policy, the basic
                        French motivation arises from the fear that if Guinea makes a success of its
                        independence, the present states of the Community will be tempted to follow
                        suit. This is, of course, a valid argument and one which we have attempted
                        to keep in mind in our dealings with both Guinea and the states of the
                        Community.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind and under heavy French pressure, the United States delayed
                        recognizing Guinea for a month following its independence. We also, at the
                        request of the French, delayed opening an Embassy and sending an Ambassador
                        until long after the Bloc had established itself. With such a slow start in
                        Guinea, it appeared essential that we not let that country go by default.
                        For this reason Sekou Touré was invited to pay a state visit which took
                        place towards the end of October. The French feel that Touré was given a
                        welcome more cordial than the circumstances warranted. This, of course, is
                        not the case and he was given the normal treatment reserved for Chiefs of
                        State. The fact that his visit aroused considerable public interest in this
                        country is something beyond the control of the United States Government. We
                        have so informed the French and have pointed out that Touré was accorded
                        similar treatment in both the United Kingdom and in West Germany.</p>
                    <p>As regards the Community, we have on every appropriate occasion expressed our
                        interest for it and the underlying concept behind it which to us represents
                        a worthwhile attempt to reconcile African political aspirations with the
                        economic facts of life. It is simply not true that we turned deaf ears to
                        Messrs. Houphouet and Tsiranana although, as you will recall, it was almost
                        impossible to get a word in edgewise in our talks with these gentlemen.

                            64 D 199)</note> Frankly, however, it is not reasonable to expect the
                        Community to last in its present form, and the Federation of Mali,
                        comprising the Republics of Senegal and Soudan, is currently negotiating
                        full independence with the French. We are hopeful that this can be arranged
                        without hard feelings on either side and that Mali will sign the necessary
                        agreements to continue its association with France. The basic difficulty at
                        the moment arises from the French desire to avoid the Moroccan experience
                        where Morocco was granted its independence subject to subsequent signatures
                        of a number of other agreements tying the country closer to <pb n="73"
                            xml:id="pg_73" facs="0103"/> France in the economic, cultural and
                        military fields. With independence, Morocco showed a reluctance to proceed
                        with these agreements, and French desires for continued close association
                        have never been fully realized. The French, therefore, wish the agreement
                        with Mali for independence and the agreements for continued association
                        would be simultaneous, whereas the Malians reportedly feel that this would
                        cast doubts on the genuine nature of their independence and they prefer,
                        therefore, to wait a period of time before signing the agreements of
                        association.</p>
                    <p>It is clearly not in our interest to become involved in the present
                        negotiations between France and Mali although we believe it highly desirable
                        that the Moroccan experience be avoided and essential that there be no
                        further episode along the lines of Guinea. The British are particularly
                        concerned about this development and have informed us that they are raising
                        the whole question of Mali with the French in Paris on December 7.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> referred to the difference of
                        view as to U.S. objectives toward South, Central and East Africa. The
                        majority of the Planning Board wished to establish three co-equal
                        objectives:</p>
                    <p>“Maintenance of the Free World orientation of the area, denial of the area to
                        Communist domination, and the minimization of Communist influence therein.”
                        (Paragraph 8)</p>
                    <p>“Orderly economic development and political progress towards
                        self-determination by the countries of the area in cooperation with the
                        metropoles and other Free World countries.” (Paragraph 9)</p>
                    <p>“Access to such military rights and facilities and strategic resources as may
                        be required in our national security interests.” (Paragraph 10)</p>
                    <p>The Treasury Representative on the Planning Board, on the other hand,
                        believed that “maintenance of the Free World orientation of the area and
                        denial of the area to Communist domination” should be primary and the other
                        objectives secondary.</p>
                    <p>The President said that the wording proposed by the two sides appeared to be
                        identical; it was simply a question of arrangement. He was inclined to agree
                        with the Treasury position because he assumed that if we were unable to
                        achieve our objective of maintaining the Free World orientation of the area
                        and denying it to Communism, we would not want to proceed with our other
                        objectives. In other words, it seemed to him that the two objectives he had
                        just mentioned laid down the necessary pre-conditions for any attempts to
                        realize our other objectives in this part of Africa. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that the position just taken by
                        the President had been taken in the Planning Board by the Treasury
                        Representative and by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMW2">Boggs</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                            >Merchant</persName> said the Treasury position was acceptable to the
                        State Department. However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJHJ1"
                            >Douglas</persName> believed that in the Cameroons, for example, the
                        U.S. might want to promote economic development and political progress even
                        if Communism did not appear there. The President agreed, but added that if
                        the countries of this area oriented themselves toward Moscow, we would not
                        wish to undertake programs for their orderly economic development and
                        political progress. As he saw it, therefore, maintenance of the Free World
                        orientation of the area and its denial to Communism was the precondition for
                        the remainder of our objectives. He preferred the Treasury version of the
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought the chances of achieving orderly
                        economic development and political progress towards self-determination by
                        the countries of the area were just about nil. In his view there was no
                        chance whatever for an orderly economic development. The President <pb
                            n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0105"/> agreed, saying that these countries
                        would be independent long before they achieved orderly economic development
                        or political progress. However, he felt that economic development and
                        political progress in this part of the world must be a U.S. objective
                        whether the countries concerned were independent or not. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had told him that within two
                        years there would be 30 independent nations in Africa.<note n="7"

                            <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had so informed the

                            <persName>Dulles</persName> said none of the 30 independent nations
                        referred to by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would have
                        the capability of governing themselves. The President agreed with Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName>’ remark, if South Africa were excluded. The
                        President said that the King of Morocco had told him that U.S. policy should
                        be to help the countries of Africa to become independent and then assist in
                        their development. The President had characterized this position as putting
                        the cart before the horse.<note n="8" xml:id="d21fn8">The President

                        <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> had a slightly different
                        point of view; he was anxious about Algeria and angry with France about the
                        boundaries at the southern end of Tunisia, but he wanted to resume close
                        relations with France.<note n="9" xml:id="d21fn9">President <persName

                        The Vice President said the British had told him that Ghana, although the
                        most viable nation in Africa, had only a 50 per cent chance for an orderly
                        development. The British anticipated that in many countries of Africa such
                        as Nigeria, a South American pattern of dictatorship would develop. The U.S.
                        must avoid assuming that the struggle in Africa will be between
                        Western-style democracy and Communism. We must recognize, although we cannot
                        say it publicly, that we need the strong men of Africa on our side. It is
                        important to understand that most of Africa will soon be independent and
                        that it would be naive of the U.S. to hope that Africa will be democratic.
                        The Vice President added that it was difficult to realize the problems faced
                        by Africa without visiting the Continent. Some of the peoples of Africa have
                        been out of the trees for only about fifty years. Since we must have the
                        strong men of Africa on our side, perhaps we should in some cases develop
                        military strong men as an offset to Communist development of the labor
                        unions. The President agreed that it might be desirable for us to try to
                        “reach" the strong men in Africa. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> felt it might be possible to try the same
                        procedures in Africa that we had successfully used in the Philippines. In
                        his view, an outstanding job had been performed by an American lieutenant
                            colonel<note n="10" xml:id="d21fn10">Lieutenant Colonel Edward G.

                        The Vice President said that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                        was being <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0106"/> influenced by a former

                            General of Ghana, September 1957–October 1, 1961.</note> Most of the
                        African leaders were incapable of exercising power when they obtained it;
                        they needed a great deal of advice. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                        that attempts were being made all around the world to provide necessary
                        advice to native leaders. However, if the advisors become conspicuous they
                        soon lose their utility. The President said he had had a personal experience
                        as an advisor to the Philippine Government. However, he had had good cover
                        in this assignment because attention had been concentrated on the activities
                        of General MacArthur. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt it was necessary
                        to work out some method of rewarding the individuals who are assigned to
                        give advice to native leaders. The President recalled that when he was
                        assigned to Washington during World War II, Quezon<note n="13"
                            xml:id="d21fn13">Manuel Quezon.</note> as leader of the Philippine
                        Government-in-exile had sought him out and insisted on giving him a monetary
                        reward for his services in the Philippines. He had, of course, declined this
                        reward. The point he wished to make was that the native governments felt a
                        great need for honest and loyal advice and were generally loyal to those who
                        advised them. The Vice President believed that the quality of U.S.
                        diplomatic representation in Africa was of vital importance. If the quality
                        of our diplomats in Africa were improved, if we sent politically
                        sophisticated diplomats to that area, a tremendous job could be accomplished
                        in orienting the African people toward the Free World.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then resumed his briefing on
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5920. When he referred to Paragraph
                        25, which provided that the U.S. would discourage the development of an arms
                        race in this portion of Africa, the President asked whether we had not had a
                        similar policy in Latin America. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> said our Latin American policy was somewhat different
                        because of hemispheric defense requirements; and the President agreed there
                        was a difference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> referred to the Financial
                        Appendix to <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5920 which showed that
                        technical assistance to South, Central and East Africa would total about $6
                        million for the period 1960-1963, while economic assistance would total
                        about $5 million for the same period. The Vice President asked whether $6
                        million for technical assistance and $5 million for economic assistance over
                        three years was enough. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>
                        said that a Special Africa Fund for special technical assistance on a
                        regular basis was under consideration as part of the Mutual Security
                        legislation for 1961. The President said he was very much in favor of the
                        Africa Fund. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> wondered
                        whether Paragraphs 26 and 27 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5920
                        would not to some extent impede the operation of the Africa Fund. Mr.
                        Riddleberger said that it was anticipated that $25 million would be
                        requested for the Africa Fund for the next <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                            facs="0107"/> fiscal year. The President believed we should encourage
                        missionaries, teachers and doctors to go to Africa. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> felt that the point raised by Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> was covered in Paragraph
                        27, which provided that the U.S. would be prepared to provide U.S. technical
                        and limited related assistance. The term “limited related assistance” was
                        intended to cover the Africa Fund.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then reported that at the last
                        Planning Board meeting on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5920 it had
                        been agreed that in view of the rapidly developing situation in the Belgian
                        Congo, the Council might find it necessary to update some portions of the
                        draft statement of policy dealing with that area.<note n="14"

                        area where agitators were able to prey on the superstitions of the people to
                        an unbelievable extent. The President remarked that man’s emotions still
                        have control over his intelligence. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> reported
                        that the imminence of independence in the Congo was causing many business
                        men and officials to leave the area. It now appeared that the Congo would
                        become independent this year. There was also some talk of the secession of
                        certain areas of the Congo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>
                        said the seceding parts wanted to form new states by annexing portions of

                    <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                    <p>1. The primary importance of the area of South, Central and East Africa is
                        its emerging political significance. There is a growing awareness in the
                        world that Africa is an area which will have an increasingly important
                        influence on the course of world events and that the political alignment of
                        the present and future independent nations of the continent will be deeply
                        affected by the policies which Western European nations and the United
                        States pursue.</p>
                    <p>2. In contrast to West Africa, the situation in this area is complicated by
                        the presence, in most of the territories concerned, of a well-entrenched
                        white settler minority together with politically less significant Asian or
                        other minorities. Despite spectacular post-war quickening of economic
                        activity in certain areas, most Africans still live the primitive life of
                        the hinterland and the African population generally is poorly prepared for
                        self-government. Nevertheless, African pressure for political equality has
                        now assumed major proportions throughout most of the area.</p>
                    <p>3. The principal problem affecting U.S. interests in this area is the
                        development of the dependent territories, in an orderly manner and in
                        cooperation with the European metropoles, toward ultimate
                        self-determination. If this transition takes place in a way which preserves
                        the essential ties which bind Western Europe and Africa, areas which are
                        economically complementary, close and mutually advantageous relationships
                        between the Western European powers and Africa can be maintained after the
                        colonial period has passed.</p>
                    <p>4. The political stability of the area faces severe trials as many of the
                        territories move more rapidly toward self-government and independence,
                        frequently amidst the strains and tensions of multi-racial <pb n="80"
                            xml:id="pg_80" facs="0110"/> and rival tribal societies. During the
                        transitional and independence periods, the opportunities for Communist
                        penetration and influence are likely to increase and complicate the already
                        difficult and complex problems of the area and make it more difficult to
                        assure the area’s identification with the West. There are indications that
                        the Communist Bloc is paying more attention to this area and that the Bloc
                        will increase its efforts to identify itself as anti-colonial. Communist
                        influence in Central and East Africa is negligible, and the African leaders
                        who have emerged thus far look primarily to the West for sympathy and
                        support. Should they fail to receive such support, they may be expected to
                        turn for it to the Communist Bloc or other countries not sympathetic to the
                        metropoles or the United States. There is a discernible Communist influence
                        in African and Indian political groups in the Union of South Africa. African
                        students both in Western Europe and in the Soviet Bloc are assiduously
                        cultivated by the Communists and many have been subverted.</p>
                    <p>5. African leaders seek the understanding and goodwill of the United States.
                        Above all, they want to be accepted and to be treated as equals and with
                        dignity and respect.</p>
                    <p>6. American economic interests in South, Central and East Africa are
                        relatively modest. In 1958 this area accounted for only 2.2 per cent of U.S.
                        trade (about $650 million). American investment in the area is approximately
                        $450 million but the great bulk of it is in the Union of South Africa where
                        most of the American economic interests lie. The area is a major source of
                        the Free World for such strategic materials as diamonds, cobalt, chromite,
                        manganese, copper and sisal. The United States is heavily dependent on the
                        area for diamonds, cobalt and chromite. The area is also an important
                        producer of many other minerals and agricultural products.</p>
                    <p>7. In the event of war or loss of Western access to sea and air routes
                        through the Middle East, control of sea and air communications in this area
                        of Africa would be extremely important. Under these circumstances, our
                        primary strategic military interest is to deny the area to Communist
                        control. In the future, moreover, there may be more significant requirements
                        (military and other) for U.S. use of rights and facilities in the area.
                        Installations in this area are already becoming increasingly important to
                        U.S. research and development in, and exploitation of, the fields of outer
                        space, missile weaponry, and world wide communications.</p>
                    <p rend="center">General Objectives</p>
                    <p>8. Maintenance of the Free World orientation of the area and denial of the
                        area to Communist domination, including:</p>
                    <p>a. The minimization of Communist influence therein;</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0111"/>
                    <p>b. Orderly economic development and political progress toward
                        self-determination by the countries of the area in cooperation with the
                        metropoles and other Free World countries; and</p>
                    <p>c. Access to such military rights and facilities and strategic resources as
                        may be required in our national security interests.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Regional Policy Guidance</p>
                    <p>9. In applying the policy guidance which follows to all parts of this area
                        except the Union of South Africa, be guided by the basic policy of
                        encouraging and, to the extent feasible, relying on Western European nations
                        to influence and support their respective dependent and recently independent
                        areas so long as such encouragement and reliance are consistent with U.S.
                        national interests.</p>
                    <p>a. Until an area achieves independence conduct U.S. activities and programs
                        in the area in full recognition of the responsibilities of the metropolitan
                        power involved, and, to the extent feasible:</p>
                    <p>(1) Consult with the responsible metropolitan power on U.S. activities and
                        programs in or relating to the area; and</p>
                    <p>(2) Avoid actions in the area or directly relating to the area likely to
                        cause serious misunderstandings between the United States and the
                        metropolitan power involved.</p>
                    <p>b. Should a situation arise in a dependent area or in an area having achieved
                        independent status in which reliance on the European power concerned would
                        not be in the U.S. interest, determine the independent U.S. course of action
                        relating to such area by taking into account:</p>
                    <p>(1) The need for establishing friendly working relationships with the newly
                        emerging state.</p>
                    <p>(2) The need to incline this state toward the Free World rather than the
                        Communist world.</p>
                    <p>(3) The effect of our policies on other Free World states having a colonial
                        heritage.</p>
                    <p>(4) The need for maintaining Free World harmony including friendly
                        relationships and consultations as appropriate with the metropolitan
                        powers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nationalism, Colonialism and Regionalism</p>
                    <p>10. Support the principle of self-determination consistently and in such a
                        way as to assure that evolution toward this objective will be orderly;
                        making clear that self-government and independence impose important
                        responsibilities which the peoples concerned must be prepared to
                        discharge.</p>
                    <p>11. Encourage those policies and actions of the metropolitan powers which
                        help prepare the dependent peoples for self-determination and responsible
                        self-government or independence. Avoid U.S. identification with those
                        policies of the metropolitan powers and the Union <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                            facs="0112"/>of South Africa which are stagnant or repressive and, to
                        the extent practicable, seek to influence the metropolitan powers and the
                        Union of South Africa to abandon or modify such policies.</p>
                    <p>12. As appropriate, encourage the formation of federation or other forms of
                        association among newly emerging states of the area which will enhance their
                        political and economic viability.</p>
                    <p>13. As feasible, support constructive, non-Communist nationalist and reform
                        movements, balancing the nature and degree of such support, however, with
                        consideration of our relations with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>14. Encourage participation of the moderate leaders in regional or

                    <p>15. Seek to correct distorted African views of U.S. race relations,
                        emphasizing, where appropriate, progress made by the United States in the
                        race relations field.</p>
                    <p>16. Encourage, where practicable, a more liberal approach in areas where
                        extremism is now the order of the day, pointing out on appropriate occasions
                        the likelihood that violence will result from continuation of rigid,
                        repressive racial policies.</p>
                    <p>17. To the extent feasible, encourage the concept of a system of government
                        and social relations which would be a middle way between the extremes of
                        black nationalism and the inequities and tensions generated by
                        apartheid.</p>

                    <p>19. Encourage American companies to set an example in practicing
                        non-discrimination in their operations to the maximum extent consistent with
                        local laws, and to train Africans for managerial positions.</p>

                        technique for political subversion. Nonetheless, maintain a flexible posture
                        that would minimize the damage to U.S. prestige in the event that such

                        appraisal of its strategic value to the United States, bearing in mind that
                        the United States may, in the future, require bases or facilities.</p>
                    <p>23. Discourage the development of an arms race in Africa and of the concept
                        that the United States is prepared to provide military assistance to any
                        nation which desires it. As countries in the area become independent,
                        encourage them to maintain adequately equipped and trained internal security

                        purpose, encourage the appropriate former metropole to provide such

                        trade and investment, (3) to take measures capable of attracting maximum
                        amounts of external private capital, and (4) to look essentially to Western

                        (excluding the Union of South Africa).</p>

                        to negotiate surplus commodity sales under P.L. 480 when appropriate.</p>
                    <p>26. In cases where U.S. assistance is provided:</p>
                    <p>a. Attention should be given to those activities which especially (1)
                        complement the efforts already undertaken by the governments of the area
                        concerned; (2) improve, develop, or conserve human resources by programs of
                        education, training, and health; (3) accelerate economic development by the
                        selective application of skills to the resources available, with particular
                        emphasis on the fields of agriculture, light manufacturing and processing
                        industries and public administration; (4) encourage private investment, both
                        domestic and foreign.</p>
                    <p>b. Within the categories in a above, accord priority to projects (1) which
                        are of particular interest to the Africans or to which they attach special
                        importance, (2) serve multi-national needs or are otherwise regional in
                        scope.</p>
                    <p>c. In the priority area of education and training give special attention to:
                        (1) surveys of the educational requirements of the area; (2) development of
                        appropriate research activities, the establishment and extension of training
                        facilities, and surveys of manpower requirements and availabilities; (3)
                        those programs designed to develop Western-oriented leaders in the area.</p>
                    <p>27. Encourage U.S. and Free World business to participate more actively in
                        the development of the economies of these countries by expanding trade and
                        investment. Seek the denial or limitation of exports of strategic

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Union of South Africa</p>
                    <p>1. The Union of South Africa is the strongest and most industrialized nation
                        in Africa. Of a total population of 14.4 million there is a permanent
                        European population of slightly over 3 million. South Africa is the world’s
                        largest producer of gold, and ranks as a leading world producer of diamonds,
                        uranium, platinum, chrome, manganese, iron ore, asbestos, antimony and
                        monazite. Until World War I the South African economy was based principally
                        on agricultural production and the mining of diamonds and gold. Since then,
                        and particularly since World War II, there has been rapid development in
                        manufacturing which now accounts for a larger proportion of the national
                        income than either agriculture or mining. With extensive reserves of coal
                        and iron, the Union is the leading steel producer in Africa. This steel
                        production provides the base on which the country’s industrial production,
                        which embraces a wide range of products, is built.</p>
                    <p>2. The closing of the Suez Canal in 1956-57 demonstrated the importance of
                        the sea routes around the Cape. The South African ports of Durban, Cape
                        Town, Port Elizabeth and East London, together with the Mozambique ports of
                        Lourenco Marques and Beira which handle the bulk of the cargo traffic for
                        the Union and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland constitute strategic
                        links with the rest of the world. These port installations in Southern
                        Africa, containing repair and supply facilities, are linked technically and
                        materially with the Union’s own industrial capability.</p>
                    <p>3. Gold production, which reached a value of $640 million in 1958, has
                        traditionally enabled the Union to import goods and services at an
                        exceedingly high rate, and has imparted to the economy generally a
                        resiliency which, inter alia, has been important in attracting further
                        investment capital. United States economic interests in the <pb n="87"
                            xml:id="pg_87" facs="0117"/> Union have increased considerably during
                        recent years. At the present time, approximately one-half of United States
                        private investment in the African continent is in the Union. There are
                        approximately 160 American firms with direct investments in the Union,
                        ranging in activity from processing and distribution to manufacturing and
                        mining. As a result of expanded U.S. economic activities in the Union, two
                        American banks recently established branches there.</p>
                    <p>4. The racial problem pervades every aspect of South African life and has
                        severe repercussions on the Union’s foreign relations. The race policy of
                        the Government is based on the concept of continued white supremacy and
                        apartheid, or separation, under which the African is considered to have
                        merely a transient status in the “white” areas of the country (i.e., outside
                        the Reserves and Bantustans<note n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">Bantustans are areas
                            in which Africans enjoy a measure of local self-government. [Footnote in
                            the source text.)</note>) and thus is restricted in his rights and
                        activities in these “white” areas. While the establishment of Bantustans
                        under the program of positive apartheid may slow the steady drift of the
                        African to the Union’s urban centers, the apartheid program does not have
                        the support of the African population and appears doomed to failure. From an
                        economic standpoint, the program is considered to be prohibitive in cost
                        and, if carried to its doctrinaire conclusion, would be seriously disruptive
                        to the country’s economy.</p>
                    <p>5. In view of the intransigence of the Union Government on its apartheid
                        policy, it is unlikely that repeated United Nation’s consideration of this
                        issue contributes to a solution.</p>
                    <p>6. The Union Government has refused to come to agreement with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> regarding the status of the former League of
                        Nations mandated territory of South West Africa. South Africa has argued
                        that it is under no compulsion to place the Territory under the U.N.
                        Trusteeship System since the United Nations is not the successor, in a legal
                        sense, to the League of Nations. This matter has been the subject of
                        considerable heated debate within the United Nations and the matter has been
                        brought before the International Court of Justice. In substance, the latter
                        has ruled that South Africa continues to have international obligations in
                        its administration of South West Africa in accordance with the terms of the
                        original mandate. Continued failure to reach an acceptable solution to this
                        problem poses a further threat to South Africa’s relations with the world
                        community.</p>
                    <p>7. South Africa’s military and security forces are organized primarily for
                        internal security, and secondarily for the defense of the Cape Sea route.
                        Internal security is the primary responsibility of the 28,000-man police
                        force. In addition, reserve military organizations are available for
                        quelling serious internal disorders. The Union Government <pb n="88"
                            xml:id="pg_88" facs="0118"/> outlawed the Communist Party under the
                        Suppression of Communism Act of 1950, and has since that time rigorously
                        banned many Communists from public activity, although Communist-line
                        publications have continued to appear. However, the comparative literacy and
                        sophistication of that part of the African population which has had a long
                        contact with European culture makes these Africans highly sensitive to the
                        inequities of their position and much more susceptible to extremist
                        solutions. Organized African groups are a primary Communist target and a
                        certain amount of penetration has taken place in all African political
                        groups. In this situation a continuation of the present racial policies of
                        the Union, by foreclosing moderate, evolutionary solutions, will increase
                        the appeal of Communist and other extreme programs and, over the longer run,
                        the chances of mounting violence between the black and white
                        communities.</p>
                    <p>8. While the security forces in the Union appear to have the situation well
                        in hand, there is an increasing possibility that African leadership may
                        succeed in enlisting mass support for an action which could cripple the
                        economy, such as a mass refusal to work or a boycott.</p>
                    <p>9. The Union of South Africa came into being on May 31, 1910, after the
                        British Parliament passed the South Africa Act of 1909. This united the four
                        self-governing British colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the
                        Transvaal and the Orange Free State. However, the three contiguous High
                        Commission Territories of Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland remained
                        under the British Crown, and this has since been a point of antagonism
                        between the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom. By the South
                        Africa Act, the United Kingdom Government may approve transfer of the
                        territories to the Union if and when the Union Parliament requests such
                        transfer. The South African Government, particularly in recent years under
                        the more extreme Afrikaner nationalism, has called for the incorporation of
                        the High Commission Territories into the Union. On the other hand, the
                        United Kingdom Government has maintained a discreet but firm insistence that
                        any changes in the Territories must reflect the wishes of the indigenous
                        inhabitants. In August 1959 the British Parliament approved a constitution
                        for Basutoland which provides for a locally elected Legislative Council and
                        autonomy in domestic affairs. A similar development in rule can be expected
                        in Bechuanaland and Swaziland in the future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi</p>
                    <p>10. The importance of the Belgian Congo derives from its size (900,000 square
                        miles; 13 million population), its central location, and its substantial
                        natural resources. The economy has undergone considerable development based
                        on the substantial extraction or production <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89"
                            facs="0119"/>of industrial raw materials and coffee, cotton, and palm
                        oil. Exports of all types of goods have been about $450 million annually.
                        There are prospects for extensive private foreign investment of a mutually
                        beneficial nature in the Congo, provided the Belgian Government is willing
                        to modify certain existing restrictions on non-Belgian capital.</p>
                    <p>11. The major causes of instability are the growing political agitation for
                        independence and the intense tribal rivalries. The prospect of independence
                        and the uncertainties as to the extent of continuing Belgian control create
                        growing tensions which are breaking out in open conflict. Racial issues have
                        not been a major cause of the instability in the Congo. There has been
                        rioting and tribal fighting throughout the area since the Leopoldville riots
                        in January 1959, just prior to the Belgian Government’s declaration which
                        promised that “Belgium intends to organize a democracy in the Congo which
                        will be capable of exercising the prerogatives of sovereignty and of
                        deciding upon its independence.”<note n="5" xml:id="d22fn5">The rioting took
                            place January 4–10, 1959, and the Belgian Government declaration was
                            issued on January 13.</note> A specific program has been outlined for
                        establishing political institutions in which the Congolese would have an
                        increasingly larger role to play. No date has been set for granting
                        self-government or complete independence nor has the eventual relationship
                        with Belgium been defined. However, the Congolese have been assured that
                        this decision will be up to them, and it is contemplated that by 1964
                        Belgian-Congolese relations will be reviewed, at which time the Congo
                        presumably could opt for independence. The presence of over 100,000 whites
                        in the Congo will probably not seriously impede these reforms.</p>
                    <p>12. Some 50 political parties have developed in the Congo and several of the
                        larger parties (particularly the <gloss target="#t_Abako1">ABAKO</gloss> or
                        Bakongo organization and the most important faction of the <gloss
                            target="#t_MNC1">MNC</gloss> or Mouvement National Congolais) have not
                        only announced that they will boycott the provincial elections planned for
                        December of this year, but also have demanded a completely independent
                        Congolese government by not later than 1960. This is only one of the
                        problems faced by the Belgians in dealing with political agitation against
                        the background of divergent tribalism and superstition. For example, the
                        Bakongo tribesmen of the Lower Congo, fearful of domination by the more
                        numerous tribes of the interior, are demanding their own tribal state
                        (including areas in the French Republic of Congo and in Angola) with only
                        vaguely defined ties to a federal government. Tribal riots and clashes may
                        be expected to continue.</p>
                    <p>13. The Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, with a total area of only 21,000
                        square miles, has a rapidly growing population of almost 5 million pressing
                        against the limited resource capabilities of a pastoral <pb n="90"
                            xml:id="pg_90" facs="0120"/> type economy. The reins of local power,
                        held by the Watutsi who comprise only 15 percent of the population, are now
                        being sought by the traditionally inferior Bahutu who account for almost 84
                        percent of the population. In addition to continuing tribal unrest, the
                        economic problems of overpopulation can be expected to plague the area for
                        some time to come. The area, which is administered as an autonomous province
                        with loose ties to the Congo, is definitely unprepared for independence and
                        in need of Belgian assistance to provide some semblance of both economic and
                        political stability. Progress toward self-government will probably be
                        slow.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Angola and Mozambique</p>
                    <p>14. Neither Angola nor Mozambique is of direct strategic, political or
                        economic importance to the United States. However, Portuguese ports and rail
                        connections in Angola and Mozambique are vital to the Federation of Rhodesia
                        and Nyasaland, and important to the Union of South Africa and the Belgian
                        Congo. Air routes through and over these provinces are strategically
                        important to the area as well as to several Western nations which are now
                        operating air routes over Angola and Mozambique. Both provinces furnish
                        labor to surrounding areas; the Union and the Rhodesias draw on Mozambique,
                        while Angola supplies part of the work force in the Belgian Congo.</p>
                    <p>15. Both provinces are undeveloped, and, while their full potential is as yet
                        unknown, they now produce coffee, cotton, sisal, diamonds, sugar, and copra
                        for export. Moderate quantities of oil have been discovered in Angola;
                        explorations are continuing in Mozambique.</p>
                    <p>16. The politically and economically repressive policies of the Portuguese
                        Government have thus far prevented in Angola and Mozambique most of the
                        political unrest and racial tension characteristic of other colonial areas
                        of Africa. However, despite Portuguese efforts to exclude unsettling
                        influences, African political awareness is emerging and is bound to grow.
                        Recent developments are likely to cause growing unrest.</p>
                    <p>17. Angola and Mozambique are legally provinces of the metro-pole. For this
                        reason there are sharp limitations on the ability of the United States to
                        influence developments in these territories.</p>
                    <p>18. In the northern region of Angola, where a portion of the vigorous Bakongo
                        tribe resides, there is a distinct possibility that political agitation by
                        the Bakongo in the Belgian Congo will have an unsettling effect, despite
                        Portuguese determination to put down any African challenge to their
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>19. In the remainder of Angola, there appears to be little possibility of
                        effective African political organization in the near future. Little is known
                        about the actual and potential strength of the underground <pb n="91"
                            xml:id="pg_91" facs="0121"/>Angolan Liberation Movement, the only
                        African political organization known to exist in the province. In
                        Mozambique, there have been isolated incidents involving resistance to the
                        Portuguese, but no organized African movement in known to exist.</p>
                    <p>20. In the short run, it is believed that internal threats to stability are
                        minimal, but in the long run, especially as neighboring areas (e.g., the
                        Belgian Congo) become African-controlled, the Portuguese can expect an
                        increasing African challenge to rule from Lisbon. Moreover, in both Angola
                        and Mozambique, dissatisfaction of the white settlers with the rigid
                        controls of the Salazar regime might prove to be a source of political
                        unrest. In anticipation of these developments, the Portuguese have
                        strengthened their military forces in both Mozambique and Angola.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland</p>
                    <p>21. The Federation has large mineral deposits and a small but growing
                        industry.</p>
                    <p>22. The Federation makes an important contribution to the strategic military
                        value of this area of Africa as described in paragraph 7 of the General
                        Considerations of the policy paper. The Federal Government has stated its
                        willingness to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the West in the defense
                        of the Middle East and has sent small but well-trained air forces to
                        participate in British exercises in the northeast Africa-Arabian Peninsula
                        area.</p>
                    <p>23. The Federation was originally formed to link Southern Rhodesia, Northern
                        Rhodesia and Nyasaland politically and economically. It was also hoped that
                        the Federation would provide the basis for a middle way between the extremes
                        of black nationalism and the inequities and tensions generated by apartheid
                        to the south. If the Federation can avoid both of these extremes, it will
                        have great importance as a stabilizing factor (and a good example of racial
                        cooperation) throughout Africa. However, in the Federation such a middle way
                        has not yet been achieved.</p>
                    <p>24. The trend of events since 1953 has been marked by a growing African
                        belief that Federation simply means continued white domination, despite real
                        gains made by Africans in the economic and social fields. The mass of
                        Africans, especially in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, are increasingly
                        vehement in their demands to govern themselves as they see the advances made
                        by Africans elsewhere on the continent. The response of the European
                        administering authorities and the settlers to African demands has so far
                        been too little and too late.</p>
                    <p>25. In this situation, unless efforts now under way achieve some
                        accommodation, there is a strong probability that strikes, boycotts,
                        intimidation of “moderate” Africans, and eventual general violence <pb
                            n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0122"/>may occur. The Nyasaland disturbances
                        of February-March, 1959, in which 51 Africans were killed, have so far led
                        only to mass arrests and detentions, and a token reorganization of the
                        Nyasaland Legislative Council. The results of a constitutional conference to
                        be held in October, 1960 will be crucial in determining whether there will
                        be widespread civil strife. At the present time, there are no serious
                        Communist-inspired or inter-tribal, threats to peace.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">British East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika,
                        Zanzibar)</p>
                    <p>26. The strategic and military importance of the area lies in its geographic
                        location and the presence there of important British military facilities. It
                        contains port facilities (particularly at Mombasa) needed for the most
                        effective defense of the Red Sea—Arabian Peninsula area. It also contains
                        extensive air transport and telecommunications facilities, which are
                        valuable if alternate routes through the Middle East are denied us. The
                        British have announced that Kenya will be developed as a staging area for a
                        mobile striking force that could be used in the Middle East. In view of
                        Kenya’s geographic position, port facilities, rail lines, and cantonments,
                        it is the logical place for such a staging operation. Although leading
                        African nationalists have opposed military development of Kenya, it is
                        probable that at the present time they are principally concerned at the
                        prospect of having such facilities used to ensure internal security before
                        self-governent is won.</p>
                    <p>27. The area produces raw materials (cotton, coffee, tea, sisal, diamonds) in
                        quantities which make East African production a factor of some importance in
                        world trade in those commodities.</p>
                    <p>28. The area’s political importance stems from its strategic location. It is
                        a region whose 21 million people are, with notable exceptions, generally
                        backward, poor and fragmented into disparate and contending groups. Without
                        British protection, the area would be a virtual power vacuum under present
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>29. The greatest threat to peace arises from the determined drive for
                        independence by the Africans and, in Kenya, from racial tension, primarily
                        between Africans and Europeans, although Asians are also involved. As it
                        becomes increasingly clear that Africans will control the government in
                        other East African territories, the pressure on Kenya African leaders to
                        keep pace with African advance elsewhere is growing. Despite a growing
                        realization on the part of many Europeans that African rule in Kenya is
                        inevitable, it is still probable that the Africans will feel compelled to
                        resort to strikes, boycotts, and other measures in order more quickly to
                        achieve their goals. In an atmosphere of high racial tensions, such tactics
                        can easily lead to general violence.</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0123"/>
                    <p>30. There is strong and widespread African dislike of Asians, who control
                        much of the commerce and industry of East Africa. To the extent that this
                        dislike continues to be expressed in actions such as the 1959 boycott of
                        Asian traders in Uganda, it may be expected to cause a flight of capital,
                        with consequent economic disorganization.</p>
                    <p>31. The possibility of inter-tribal conflict is great, especially as British
                        authority is withdrawn. Further, an effort by the Somalis to implement the
                        “Greater Somalia” concept would certainly create difficulties in northern
                        Kenya.</p>
                    <p>32. Penetrations by the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the Soviet
                        Union are potential threats to political stability, but the possibility of
                        subversion by both countries, particularly the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, may become greater as the East African countries
                        eventually become independent.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6004/1 is printed in vol. XIII,
                            pp. 740-749.</note> He read the following extract from Paragraph 2 of
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005:</p>
                    <p>“West Africa is probably the fastest changing area in the world today. New
                        countries are springing up with startling rapidity and the people of the
                        area are determined that control of West Africa will be firmly in West
                        African hands.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he concurred
                        completely in the statement he had just read. The happenings of the last
                        eighteen months in Africa were quite startling. For instance, Belgium had
                        agreed to grant independence to the Congo this June, a concession which
                        would have been unthinkable a year ago. This concession had stimulated
                        desires for independence among other countries of Africa. Africa thus
                        presented a picture of a changing situation and a battleground of the first
                        order. In fact, he would prefer that the countries of Africa not become
                        independent quite so fast. Despite his wishes, however, in the next decade
                        the membership of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would increase to
                        100 nations, 49 of which would be members of the Afro-Asian Bloc.
                        Consequently, the Soviet Bloc and the Afro-Asian Bloc voting together could
                        control the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If we continued to bank on
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as we had in the past, we must make
                        every effort to hold the emerging African nations on our side of the fence.
                        He felt he must emphasize the uncertainties of the situation and insist that
                        the U.S. not put itself in a straitjacket so far as assistance is concerned.
                        He would like to try to get the former metropoles to give greater assistance
                        to the new African nations. He felt this was a question of degree rather
                        than one of basic substance; the Planning Board could work out the language
                        for the paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said he shared
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s view that this
                        was a question of degree. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> also shared the view that the question was one of
                        degree, but felt the language was also important because language was a
                        guide to the operators. He said the two problems we had to worry most about
                        in the future were the problems of farm prices here and our balance of
                        payments abroad. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName>
                        felt the balance of payments problem was a world-wide problem in which the
                        whole world had a stake. Our balance of payments situation had recently
                        improved, but this did not mean that we could brush the problem aside for
                        the future. We should insist that other countries do their share in
                        providing assistance to the underdeveloped regions. Countries such as the
                        U.K. were not interested in providing assistance to Latin America, which was
                        regarded as a U.S. preserve, but the U.K. <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95"
                            facs="0125"/> had great interest in Africa. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> after his trip to Africa<note
                            n="8" xml:id="d23fn8">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> visited Ghana, Nigeria,
                            the Central African Federation, and South Africa, January 6–February
                            5.</note> had said that the U.K. must contribute to economic assistance
                        to that continent and a recent U.K. White Paper had emphasized British
                        economic aid to Africa. If we want the metropoles to assume part of the
                        burden of assistance, we must induce them to assume this burden in areas in
                        which they are interested. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> was not proposing that the U.S. isolate itself from
                        West Africa. He was willing to give assistance to Guinea and Liberia as
                        special cases. The majority, however, wanted an overall exception from Basic
                        Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5906/1),<note n="9"
                            xml:id="d23fn9">
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5906/1, “Basic National Security

                            III.</note> which had recognized this very problem. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> felt that the splits in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 could be easily resolved on a basis of
                        saying to the European countries, “This situation in Africa is your primary
                        obligation.” He did not want to subscribe to the idea that the interests of
                        European countries in nations becoming free and independent were different
                        from our interests. He did not want to agree to a blanket exception. He did
                        want to indicate to the European countries what we felt they should do
                        regarding assistance to Africa.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said it appeared to
                        him that there was no basic disagreement between the Departments of State
                        and the Treasury. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> felt
                        that the words used by Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                            >Herter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName>
                        in describing this problem were preferable to the words used in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005.</p>
                    <p>The President recalled that in conversations with him, European
                        representatives had said that they must put all their efforts in matters of
                        assistance into the areas of their former colonies or possessions. Both
                        Macmillan and <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> had made
                        observations along these lines. If we were to get the cooperation of the
                        European nations, we would have to get it with respect to areas where these
                        nations have the biggest interests and the greatest obligations. While
                        reserving our right to tender our assistance if necessary, we should put
                        responsibility for assistance to Africa on the U.K. and France.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> believed it was difficult to generalize
                        because so much depended on circumstances. If an African nation achieves
                        independence on the basis of cordial relations between it and the metropole,
                        then the metropole can render effective assistance to the new nation. On the
                        other hand, if independence is achieved under conditions of strain and
                        bitterness, the newly independent nation will not wish the help of the
                        metropole. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt the situation in the Congo
                        might develop in either direction. He believed the paper should be flexible.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> agreed that
                        flexibility in our policy was needed. He <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96"
                            facs="0126"/> added that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might
                        help to cover the contingency where a new nation afraid of domination by the
                        former metropole preferred assistance on a multilateral basis.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that he had felt in the
                        preparation of this paper that the State representatives had made the
                        assumption that whatever the metropoles did would be inadequate, while
                        Treasury and Budget had thought this assumption was too sweeping. A revised
                        paper might contain a statement of general principles followed by guidance
                        providing that the U.S. should consult with the U.K. and France to ascertain
                        what assistance is needed in Africa and what assistance it is possible for
                        the U.K. and France on the one hand and the U.S. on the other to give. State
                        representatives, however, had pointed out that there was a hazard in this
                        consultation; conferring with other nations about assistance to Africa might
                        be equivalent to inviting them to ask us to provide more assistance. The
                        President said that the nations we consulted might ask us to provide funds
                        to them which they could in turn give to the newly independent countries.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said this might be good
                        grounds for not consulting the U.K. and France, but he was reminded of the
                        discussion of Libya, during which the Council directed that we should
                        consult with the U.K. regarding assistance to Libya. Perhaps we were making
                        too many easy assumptions about the situation, while failing to communicate
                        with other countries to find out what could be done. The President agreed
                        that we must consult with other nations if we were to be successful in
                        achieving a cooperative effort by the industrial nations to help the
                        underdeveloped nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        said that discussions on this subject had been held with the U.K. and France
                        last fall. These countries no longer want us to channel funds to the new
                        nations through them. In other words, there had been a dramatic shift in the
                        attitude of the British and the French. The French had indicated they would
                        welcome a coordinated approach to the problem of assistance to African
                        countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said a meeting
                        on this subject was now scheduled for April 15 in Washington.<note n="10"
                            xml:id="d23fn10">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> He
                        agreed with Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> that our policy should be
                        flexible. We should obtain the maximum degree of assistance from the
                        European nations, but we should tender assistance ourselves when necessary.
                        The President felt the conference referred to by Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would be helpful. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that France had said it would
                        maintain its assistance to Africa after independence on the same scale as
                        before independence, but would need some aid from us in the form of
                        Development Loan Fund assistance. The President said it was possible that
                        the European countries could pour enough assistance into a single African
                        country to make that country very prosperous and thus have a great effect on
                        other African countries. He added that he did not <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"
                            facs="0127"/>believe the difference between the divergent views in this
                        paper could be measured as exactly as the Financial Appendix to <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 seemed to indicate.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> wished to make two
                        more observations. In the first place, during the next decade there would be
                        no such thing as an adequate amount of assistance. In the second place, it
                        was more important to the Free World for the U.S. to maintain a sound
                        position as the world’s reserve banker than it was for the U.S. to give a
                        billion or so more in assistance. We must avoid giving the world the
                        impression that we are overstepping our capabilities. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he could appreciate the
                        anxiety that assistance to West Africa might become an additional burden on
                        the U.S. However, he felt our total assistance burden was one problem, while
                        the distribution of our total assistance was another problem. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said the European
                        nations would not help in Latin America or Japan. If we induced the European
                        countries to provide assistance, such assistance would be provided only in
                        the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> felt the differences of
                        opinion reflected in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 were greater
                        than the differences of opinion expressed at the meeting. He read the
                        language proposed by the majority on Page 6 to the effect that probable U.K.
                        and French assistance will be far short of the reasonable needs of their
                        former dependencies. He urged that the Council not adopt this
                            conclusion.<note n="11" xml:id="d23fn11">The line objected to reads: “In
                            any event, probable U.K. and French assistance will be far short of the
                            needs for outside public assistance which many of the former
                            dependencies feel they will require.”</note> In support of this view, he
                        cited a recent article in The New York Times, which indicated that France
                        and other countries were putting large sums of money into African
                            territories.<note n="12" xml:id="d23fn12">Reference is to an article by

                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> then read the split
                        Paragraph 16 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 and suggested that
                        the right-hand column be adopted. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> suggested that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005
                        be referred back to the Planning Board for revision. He was not happy with
                        the splits in the paper and believed the Planning Board could do a better
                        job in the light of the discussion, although he would not promise that the
                        Board would re-submit a paper which was agreed on in all respects. The
                        President said he wished to press the U.K. and France as hard as possible to
                        give as much assistance as they could; we would take up the slack. He felt
                        that all parties to the discussion were trying to say the same thing. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said more peace and harmony
                        existed at this level of discussion than at the Planning Board. The
                        President said the Council must deal with the big picture.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then noted that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had proposed the insertion in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> 6005 of a new paragraph as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0128"/>
                    <p>“Establish technically competent observers in African countries to keep
                        abreast of military developments.”</p>
                    <p>The President said he hoped this provision did not mean that we would be
                        sending out more Military Attachés. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> said he was afraid the provision would mean more
                        Military Attachés. A paragraph of this kind had been omitted from the policy
                        statement on South, Central and East Africa because the Planning Board had
                        considered the question an operational one and had noted that it was the
                        subject of negotiations between the Departments of State and Defense.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> said the proposed
                        paragraph might result in more Military Attachés, but it was broader than
                        this. For example, in Ecuador a tremendous job of technical assistance was
                        being accomplished by one naval officer and five enlisted men. He felt
                        assistance of this kind was more important than monetary assistance. [8
                        lines of source text not declassified] The President said perhaps Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> had been talking about
                        obtaining information by sending out persons who rendered assistance to
                        African countries. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                        said the proposal by the Joint Chiefs of Staff was an operational rather
                        than a policy matter. He added that it was difficult to find individuals who
                        have any knowledge of Africa, as he had once discovered when he had tried to
                        set up an African Institute in Washington. The State Department was now
                        making an effort to train personnel for diplomatic posts in the countries of
                        Africa about to become independent.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Burgess said that attempts to reorganize the O.E.E.C. had been
                        directed at inducing the European countries to do a better job of rendering
                        assistance in the underdeveloped parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> noted that the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal on military observers had been
                        discussed by the Council and that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                            >Herter</persName> had indicated that it was an operational problem now
                        under discussion between State and Defense.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                    <p>There is general agreement in the Department that events in Africa have moved
                        so rapidly as to have overtaken our ability to cope with them. The political
                        evolution of Africa has indeed progressed to a point where, in my opinion,
                        the Executive Branch must be prepared to treat the continent as a major
                        policy area. My use of the phrase Executive Branch is deliberate, because
                        the only major policy disagreement is our divergence with Treasury and the
                        Bureau of the Budget (<gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss>) currently
                        epitomized in the pending National Security Council (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>) policy paper for West Africa.<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1"
                            >See <ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The fundamental split appears in the Economic Section of the paper, wherein
                        Treasury and <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> suggest primary reliance on
                        other free world sources of capital to meet the needs of West Africa. While
                        we hope and expect that the European countries will provide substantial
                        amounts of assistance, I believe we must depend to a larger extent than at
                        present on our own resources to take whatever action may become necessary
                        for our national interest. The political situation may change or relations
                        worsen so quickly between metropole states and their dependencies or former
                        dependencies that other Guineas may develop. Complete dependence on
                        metropoles or former metropoles is dangerously unrealistic if we are
                        determined to retain a Western-oriented African continent. The
                            Treasury-<gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> point of view would put the
                        United States in the position of being able to take positive action only in
                        order to counter Soviet moves and would condemn us to a negative, secondary
                        role in Africa. I very much doubt that additional committee work, surveys or
                        reviews would resolve this dispute. What is needed is a decision by the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Once such a decision was obtained we would be in a position rationally to
                        consider problems of assistance. The main policy lines seem to be clear.
                        However, intensive expert study on specific problems <pb n="100"
                            xml:id="pg_100" facs="0130"/> is needed. Much could be accomplished by
                        your designation of Africa as an area to receive priority attention by all
                        interested offices of the Department and associated agencies.</p>
                    <p>Pending such study and emergence of its results, we must decide immediately
                        whether we should seek additional funds now for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1961. As a practical matter, I do not believe it would be
                        wise to scrap our existing presentation this late in the legislative
                        process. I believe we can get through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                        with our presently requested levels of aid provided a number of recommended
                        actions (discussed below) are taken. Whatever additional requirements
                        develop during the year for new programs in emerging countries can, I trust,
                        be covered by the Contingency Fund.</p>
                    <p>I would like to highlight a recommendation which I believe would
                        substantially improve our position in African eyes without requiring an
                        immediate increase in aid for Africa. A major speech by the Secretary,
                        directed specifically toward the newly independent and emerging countries of
                        Africa and expressing US interest in their development and willingness to
                        help, would in my opinion, be of great help at the present time.</p>
                    <p>There is one additional requirement that I consider urgent: ways must be
                        found to increase the rate of loan activity of the Development Loan Fund
                            (<gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>) and the Export-Import Bank. These
                        institutions serve as symbols of the United States interest in Africa, thus
                        partially compensating for the scarcity of the International Cooperation
                        Administration (<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>) funds programmed for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961. I urge that <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> be instructed to give priority attention to
                        Tropical Africa and to review its criteria and procedures in order to meet
                        the special problems African loans present. <gloss target="#t_DLF1"
                            >DLF</gloss> operations in Africa are hampered by the inability of
                        newly-organized governments to prepare in proper form, the necessary
                        feasibility surveys and project data needed to support applications, by the
                        policies of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> generally to cover foreign
                        exchange costs only and by restricting procurement to the United States.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that we can any longer avoid a forthright position that we
                        are genuinely determined to help the peoples of Africa to cope with their
                        problems and secure their newly won independence on solid economic
                        foundations. Our posture must give Africans the impression that the United
                        States regards Africa as an important region in world affairs in its own
                        right and not just as an adjunct in the Cold War.</p>
                    <p>Although we are concerned with Communism we should not overemphasize it in
                        our public statements on Africa. To imply by words or deeds that we are
                        suddenly interested in Africa only because the Bloc has become interested
                        will result in driving Africans into cynical neutralism or worse. To pledge
                        our interest and intention to help, and then to fail to respond promptly and
                        adequately when <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0131"/>requests
                        materialize, would only tend to confirm an impression already unfortunately
                        created by the contrasting actions of the Bloc and the West in Guinea, that
                        only one side in the Cold War really understands and appreciates the
                        problems of newly emergency [emerging] nations.</p>
                    <p>The following paragraphs discuss specific topics which I believe are of
                        sufficient importance to warrant your attention.</p>

                    <p>A. Speech by the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>I have been impressed by the fact that most of the African leaders,
                        completely apart from any aid requests, want us to treat Africa with
                        dignity, understanding and as an equal. <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> in
                        its attached paper (Tab B) states: “The greatest immediate problem is the
                        lack of bold initiative in creating a new climate between the United States
                        and the emerging nations of this vast continent. We are faced again with a
                        situation not unlike that which confronted us at the time of the

                        task of creating peace with freedom and justice, a speech which sets the
                        record straight to the whole world, on US intentions to strengthen in Africa
                        and elsewhere, every democratic force in the free world.”<note n="2"

                    <p>As discussed above, there is urgent need for a decision on whether we are to
                        have a positive or negative policy on Africa. Although the issue is obscured
                        by the compromises and hair-splitting phraseology which emerge from the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> machinery, there is in fact a deep
                        divergence within the Government. Until this is settled, I do not see how it
                        is possible for us to pursue a positive, constructive or imaginative policy
                        toward Africa.</p>

                        investment fears political instability and the possibility that new African

                    <p>A group has been working on this subject for some weeks and it is making good

                    <p>One of the most dangerous weapons of Soviet economic infiltration in Africa
                        is bloc willingness to buy all the export produce of single commodity
                        countries. Until the West develops some way of assuring these countries a
                        ready market for their exports at reasonable prices our policy is to a
                        dangerous extent dependent on world commodity price fluctuations.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi>

                    <p>That you ask Mr. Mann<note n="10" xml:id="d24fn10">Thomas C. Mann, Assistant
                            Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.</note> to designate and chair a

                    </p>
                    <p>Africa is not Europe nor is it even India. We must seek to develop tools for
                        economic cooperation which are particularly suitable for Africa. New
                        concepts of mutual security assistance and the application of existing
                        concepts with greater flexibility are necessary. The terms of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> technical assistance agreements may have to
                        be altered to fit Africa’s sensitivities and inexperience. Procedures which
                        are suitable elsewhere in the world may not be acceptable because of
                        inexperience and sensitivity and should not necessarily apply in Africa.
                        Frustration and delay in US programs will jeopardize our position in Africa
                        through failure of these programs, which, in most cases, are not costly and
                        contribute greatly to the US presence.</p>

                        Briefing Note, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said he wished
                        to raise one additional point. At the Council Meeting of March 24 the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had proposed the insertion of a new paragraph in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 providing for technically competent
                        observers in African countries to keep abreast of military developments. The
                        Council had discussed this proposal and decided that the question was an
                        operational one. Accordingly, the paragraph had not been included in the
                        policy paper. General Cabell, however, was concerned over this problem and
                        wanted to discuss it further.</p>
                    <p>General Cabell said the paragraph proposed by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                            >JCS</gloss> was of interest to <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> but
                        was, in his view, too narrow. He suggested that the paragraph might be
                        amended to provide that competent observers would be established in African
                        countries to keep abreast of military or internal security developments. He
                        also suggested that the title of this section of the paper (Page 14) be
                        changed from “Military and Strategic" to “Military, Strategic and Internal
                        Security.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said he understood
                        General Cabell’s suggestions were acceptable to Defense, but he wondered
                        whether the Department of State still felt that the paragraph was of such an
                        operational nature that it should not be included in the policy paper. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he had no objection
                        to including the paragraph as amended in the paper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then asked leave to discuss
                        a broader aspect of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005. He noted that
                        discussion of this paper at two meetings of the Council had been devoted
                        primarily to the differences of opinion on financial assistance to the
                        indigenous countries, on the share of assistance to be provided by the U.S.
                        and the metropoles, respectively, and so on. After discussion, it appeared
                        that there was really not much difference of opinion on these subjects.
                        However, he desired to emphasize the overriding political significance of
                        the area, the fate of which is now hanging in the balance. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought the fate of the area would
                        depend on the actions taken by the U.S. and Western Europe (1) to solve the
                        difficult problems which the newly-independent countries of West Africa were
                        facing and (2) to meet the aggressive Soviet Bloc attack in the area. He
                        considered West Africa a priority area from the political point of view and
                        believed the U.S. would have to assume an active role to protect U.S.
                        political interests there. Such an active role for the protection of our
                        political interests would be a departure from the traditional U.S. position
                        with respect to Africa.</p>

                    <p>The President said it seemed to him that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> was saying that the Operations Coordinating Board
                        should do a very good job of implementing the policy in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005. Mr. Dillion agreed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then remarked that
                        Paragraph 18–B of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005 was technically
                        deficient in that it referred to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        assistance “other than development financing.” This language did not take
                        account of the fact that the World Bank was a Specialized Agency of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> said the language of the paragraph could be adjusted to
                        reflect the relationship of the World Bank to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. The phrase “other than development financing” in Paragraph
                        18–B was designed to preserve a provision which appears in Paragraph 32 of
                        Basic National Security Policy (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> set
                        the scene and outlined the events leading to the present meeting; he said
                        that <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>’s problem was epitomized by the
                        situation in Guinea, which illustrates the numerous frustrations involved
                        and the dangers of subordinating United States policy to that of the former
                        mother country. He stressed the need to simplify our aid procedures, and
                        noted the extreme difficulty in obtaining African countries’ concurrence to
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> umbrella agreements when “the
                        Chinese ask for no privileges for their people”. This was one reason for the
                        long delays in trying to carry out our modest offer of 150 scholarships to
                        Guinea.</p>
                    <p>The most important policy question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> said, is whether or not we are to rely mainly
                        on the metropoles to assist their former dependent areas in Africa. He
                        indicated his own skepticism about the role of the metropoles and mentioned
                        a recent telegram from Brussels in which the United States was asked to
                        assume the burden of large-scale aid to the Congo.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d26fn1">Telegram 1159 from Brussels, April 5. (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Ibid</hi>., 855A.00/4–560)</note> On the other hand, he referred to
                        the apparent decision of the French to continue aid to their formerly
                        dependent areas in return for certain military and political concessions. He
                        also referred to the split in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Policy
                        Paper on West Africa in which State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        opposed the Treasury on the role of the metro-poles; <note n="2"
                            xml:id="d26fn2">See <ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>.</note> he
                        feared that if Treasury’s views prevailed, they would compel a negative
                        policy on the part of the United States.</p>
                    <p>In the political and psychological sphere, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> recommended that the Secretary make a major
                        policy speech directed specifically toward Africa, to indicate our attention
                        and interest in the area, and our desire to be of assistance. He urged this
                        action only if the speech could be forthright.</p>
                    <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0141"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that among the
                        sources of economic aid, the Development Loan Fund could play a very
                        important role in Africa, especially in view of our difficulty in getting
                        larger aid funds. Under its present regulations, however, the <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> does not meet the needs of Africa.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded by
                        saying he considered the meeting well worthwhile and that he appreciated the
                        thought and effort put into the project. The papers submitted by the various
                        bureaus and agencies contained a great many interesting and valuable ideas.
                        He said that Africa is now getting priority attention, which is what it
                        deserves.</p>
                    <p>As to the recommendations submitted by AF, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said he wanted coordinated recommendations prior to
                        definite action by himself. <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> should take
                        the lead in drawing up a paper or papers indicating areas of agreement; it
                        should also point out divergencies of views if these existed. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said this would provide further
                        consultation before we “marched into action”.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, who had attended both
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> sessions on West Africa,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d26fn3">See <ref target="#d23">Documents 23</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d25">25</ref>.</note> did not feel that serious policy
                        differences existed on the West African paper. The Secretary of Treasury had
                        urged that the United States seek maximum effort from the European countries
                        to assist their former dependencies. If the European countries did not
                        supply their needs or if the African territories were unwilling to accept
                        aid from the former metropoles, and if additional aid were needed, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt all agencies in
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> were agreed that the U.S. should
                        fill the gap. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that
                        Treasury and Budget were not concerned in the operation of <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and grant aid; they could, however, exert
                        some influence on loans. Nevertheless, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> felt that <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> should
                        not be worried by Treasury’s attitudes but should be guided by the policy
                        outlined in the State Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said one could argue that Brussels’ Telegram No. 1159
                        lent weight to Treasury’s point of view—that the Belgians were always
                        anxious to shift the burden to someone else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned his statement in
                        the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting April 7 in which he drew
                        attention to the basic significance of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> document. He had urged the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>, in its concentration on language, not to overlook the
                        great political importance of the African area and the vital challenge from
                        the Soviet Bloc countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        had pointed out that the United States had to move rapidly and vigorously in
                        this unusual situation. Treasury and Budget had expressed no disagreement
                        with this statement of priorities.</p>
                    <p>On the specific <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> recommendations, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought that a speech by
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> was well worth
                        considering; such a speech would be no good without adequate content. The
                        Secretary could not <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0142"/> make a
                        decision until he had seen a draft or outline. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, therefore, recommended that <gloss
                            target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> send a draft speech to the Secretary in order
                        to crystallize what we had in mind.</p>
                    <p>In discussing appropriations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> did not think we were far enough along to mention
                        specific figures; but this was obviously a matter to be given priority
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> felt it would be difficult
                        for <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> to make fundamental changes in its
                        policies for Africa, without agreeing to changes for the rest of the world.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> recommended further
                        discussions between Mr. Brand of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> and
                        interested officers of the Department. This was particularly pertinent on
                        use of local currency. For example, it had been found that Tanganyika was
                        covering both foreign and local currency costs of a highway. It was believed
                        that the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> could handle foreign currency
                        costs on the two sections of the highway and that Tanganyika could cover
                        local currency expenses on both sections.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned that difficulty
                        in getting underdeveloped African nations to prepare projects according to
                        U.S. standards and in accordance with all the opportunities available to
                        them had been encountered in other parts of the world. This could best be
                        solved through <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> technical assistance
                        programs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said <gloss
                            target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                        should have further discussions to see what could be worked out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also raised the question of
                        what the Export-Import Bank had done in Africa. He considered that Mr.
                            Waugh,<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">Samuel C. Waugh, President and
                            Chairman of the Export-Import Bank.</note> with his knowledge of Africa,
                        could be quite helpful. He asked for a report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned that <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had set up a special group to work out a
                        coordinated program for Africa, including the question of stationing <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> officers in consular posts in Africa.<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">On March 31, the Temporary Advisory Group on

                            Assistance to Tropical Africa.</note> He indicated his readiness to
                        agree after the problem had been thought out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> mentioned Recommendation 7
                        in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>’s memorandum of
                        March 30, “Means of assuring friendly single community [commodity] countries
                        a ready market for their exports at reasonable and stable prices”. While not
                        minimizing the difficulties, he thought we should look into this to see what
                        could be done; he mentioned coffee as an example.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> referred to multi-lateral
                        vs. bi-lateral aid. He thought we needed them both. He thought we should
                        study ways in which we could help the U.S. to expand its activities. He
                        recognized two problems in this area; how to get the recipient nations
                        together and how to get the recipient nations to participate in
                        international organizations with contributor nations.</p>
                    <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0143"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> agreed we must supplement
                        bi-lateral aid with multilateral, and stated that the U.N. was at the
                        present carrying on at least 14 different kinds of assistance activities
                        which might be expanded and better coordinated. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> felt strongly that we must
                        continue bi-lateral aid in addition to multi-lateral.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed with Recommendation
                        10 of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>’s paper, that
                        we should encourage the African countries to become members of the <gloss
                            target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> also concurred that the
                        Exchange of Persons Program was very important; the subject should be
                        discussed further with the various agencies concerned such as <gloss
                            target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_IES1">IES</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As to the procedures to be used in following up this meeting, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> urged <gloss target="#t_AF1"
                            >AF</gloss> and the principal agencies concerned to draw up agreed
                        papers, with agreed terms of reference before setting up committees. Such a
                        paper or papers could be approved by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> at once, or he could resolve any differences. The
                        group present today could meet again in three months to indicate the results
                        of their efforts, but this might not be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> mentioned that
                            <gloss target="#t_UMSC1">U/MSC</gloss>—Mr. Bell—had recommended a
                        Marshall Plan-type task force operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> said he would be agreeable to a small
                        coordinating committee. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        said the agencies should work together to decide what kind of committee
                        there should be; they should also decide what studies were necessary and
                        should go ahead and make them. As to the scope of the efforts in the
                        development of recommendations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> that a Marshall Plan-type task force was not
                        appropriate this year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        noted that the paper submitted by E contained many novel and interesting
                        ideas which deserved careful study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Riddleberger, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, said today’s meeting
                        had focused the attention of everyone on Africa; he hoped the case of Guinea
                        would prove to be an exception. He favored “flexibility” but there was a
                        problem on how far <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> could go. He felt
                        that <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should attempt to get umbrella
                        agreements with African countries whenever possible. <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> had decided to establish a group and to move ahead on
                        procedures. He agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        that <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> decisions in the West African paper
                        would not prevent <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> from moving ahead on
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 program. Mr. Riddleberger noted
                        that the list of activities of the U.N., while numerous, were not very
                        impressive as far as programs are concerned; the U.N. aid had to be
                        supplemented. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> agreed but
                        believed that the U.N. might be in a position to exercise a unique influence
                        in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Riddleberger was agreeable to assigning personnel to African consular
                        posts; he could allocate people according to the circumstances which we
                        faced. Mr. Riddleberger said it was too late to modify programs <pb n="114"
                            xml:id="pg_114" facs="0144"/>for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> “61
                        but that contingency money could be used to supplement <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> remarked that it was not practical to submit a
                        request for supplemental funds for aid. Mr. Saccio noted that an allocation
                        of $40 to $60 million from the Contingency Fund requested for <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> “61 might be needed; Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that we hoped that the Senate
                        would restore the House cuts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Riddleberger mentioned his conversation with the Belgian Ambassador
                        regarding the Congo; the Congo’s favorable balance of payments of about $200
                        million had been more than offset by the flight of capital. The Belgian
                        Ambassador reported that restrictions had been placed on transfers of funds
                        from the Congo in order to halt this capital flight.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Riddleberger referred to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>’s very large
                        Exchange of Persons Program. This program would be continued.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Riddleberger thought it might be possible to make some adjustment in
                        funds, according to priorities. He felt that money in <gloss target="#t_TC1"
                            >TC</gloss> programs could be shifted on the basis of need; personnel
                        and money for Africa might be obtained through this re-programming for the
                        next fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Vance Brand of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> said that Africa was
                        fully considered in <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>’s planning. He saw
                        no need to revise <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>’s policies or
                        procedures for Africa. <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> was prepared to
                        send a mission to Africa to work out techniques and procedures which would
                        be in harmony with <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>’s existing policies.
                        He noted that Tanganyika and Nigeria might be examples where, by revising
                        the implementation of development programs, the foreign currency loans could
                        be made by <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>. Mr. Brand assured the group
                        that the Department could depend on <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>’s
                        cooperation but that, in accordance with current practice, State should
                        provide guidance on priorities.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> pointed
                        out that the basic question was whether we should only react to Soviet
                        initiatives or whether we should try to “beat them to the punch”. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> interjected that this was
                        certainly our goal; we hoped to find ways to outguess and to surpass the
                        Russians in this vital area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> emphasized that we must show the African
                        countries we do not help them only to counteract Communist aid.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bell of <gloss target="#t_UMSC1">U/MSC</gloss> thought the papers
                        submitted for the meeting showed the extent of worry within agencies
                        concerned about the situation in Africa. He was impressed by several
                        factors: If we are thinking of actions which will require funds in <gloss
                            target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> “62, we must have a program by the autumn of
                        this year. We must have a concrete plan which will stand up to attack, and
                        not mere generalizations. Mr. Bell considered that we would need specific
                        analysis of what United States’ interests are in the area, what plans or
                        problems exist in each country, and how these problems will develop. The
                        analysis should state our objectives, <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115"
                            facs="0145"/>what we should do, and how to do it. He remarked also on
                        the broad differences between various African territories. Mr. Bell
                        emphasized that the African Bureau needed more personnel, in order to handle
                        its increasing responsibilities. The staff of <gloss target="#t_AF1"
                            >AF</gloss>, already overworked, would not be able to develop the
                        studies necessary. If nothing were done along this line, Mr. Bell thought
                        the Department would be faced with attempting to react to one crisis after
                        another. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that our
                        objective must result in specific action on specific programs; we should,
                        therefore, look into overall problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Martin of E strongly endorsed Mr. Bell’s statement. He felt that the
                        problems should be considered as divided into three stages: first, we had
                        certain emergency problems; then that a task force should be set up (rather
                        than a series of committees) to determine over the next 6 months what we
                        wanted to do, country by country, and in time for 1962 MSP organizing; and
                        that finally we need to examine thoroughly in this area, without too many
                        previous commitments, the longer range organization and structure to channel
                        aid to Africa. In stage three, we should consider both multi-lateral and
                        bi-lateral aid, what role each should play, as well as how Africans could
                        best be brought into the picture. We should also carry out studies of
                        possible programs on a regional as well as country-by-country basis. Mr.
                        Bell agreed with him that Africa represented one of the greatest
                        opportunities which the United States had ever had.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> of <gloss target="#t_IO1"
                            >IO</gloss> emphasized the impact of so many new states emerging in a
                        short period and with unexpected rapidity. At the beginning, the new states
                        are wrapped up in immediate, constitutional problems. He thought it was
                        vital that the United States should adjust its programs for this crucial
                        period just before and just after independence when our efforts would make a
                        maximum impact. He thought it was only slight exaggeration to consider the
                        emergence of these new countries the most significant development of the
                        century. He thought the United States had a great opportunity in Africa if
                        we acted with imagination and courage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bradford of <gloss target="#t_CU1">CU</gloss> reported that the <gloss
                            target="#t_IES1">IES</gloss> program in Africa was relatively small and
                        highly selective. Mr. Thayer is the Secretary’s Coordinator for all cultural
                        exchanges. Mr. Bradford noted the extensive studies on that subject which
                        the Bureau of International Cultural Relations had already made.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Roberts of <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> remarked that our impact
                        on Africans depended 90% on what we did and only 10% on what we say. He said
                        we need to know where we are going. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> fully concurred with these observations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McBride of <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> warned that we should have
                        no illusions about getting more aid for Africa from the European metropoles.
                        The United States would be fortunate if we could encourage them to continue
                            <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0146"/>aid at present levels. He
                        pointed out that France had agreed to keep up assistance to Mali and to
                        Malagasy for the next several years at a relatively high level. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> of <gloss
                            target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> noted, however, that French assistance was
                        always conditional on political support by the French Community in the U.N.
                        and elsewhere. If this support were not forthcoming, French aid would be
                        withdrawn and other Guineas might develop. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that perhaps West Germany could provide some
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated his
                        readiness to take any necessary action, as soon as papers are cleared, and
                        to send letters or telegrams, if desired, to the field or to other agencies
                        on a piecemeal basis as they are ready. He declared again that Africa is a
                        high priority area. He would look to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> and <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> to guide
                        and lead in carrying out decisions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> agreed that <gloss
                            target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> would communicate with officials and agencies
                        concerned, in accordance with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>’s instructions, to see what actions were needed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> concluded the meeting by
                        requesting all agencies to give their full cooperation and support in
                        meeting the high-priority needs of the African area.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>1. The primary importance of West Africa is its growing political
                        significance. There is a developing awareness that Africa is an area which
                        will have an increasingly important influence in the course of world events
                        and that its political alignment will be deeply affected by the policies of
                        Western European nations and the United States. This increasing influence
                        may be expected to make itself felt primarily in the United Nations as a
                        growing number of independent African nations take their seats and join in
                        voting on many issues with the less-developed nations. African leaders seek
                        the understanding and goodwill of the United States. Above all, they want to
                        be accepted as equals and to be treated with dignity and respect. One of
                        their criteria of success in this connection is membership in the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>2. West Africa is probably the fastest changing area in the world today. New
                        countries are springing up with startling rapidity and the people of the
                        area are determined that control of West Africa will be firmly in West
                        African hands. Though many of the countries are sorely lacking in both human
                        and economic resources, this fact does not and will not slow the drive
                        toward self-government and independence. There are presently four
                        independent countries in West Africa: Liberia, Ghana, Guinea and Cameroun.
                        Independence is scheduled for Togo on April 27 and Nigeria on October 1,
                        1960. In addition Mali—an autonomous state, within the French community,
                        formed by federation of the former colonies of Soudan and Senegal—is now
                        negotiating with the French the terms under which it would attain <pb
                            n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0148"/>independence, probably this summer,
                        but with continued strong ties with France and with French assistance. The
                        Malagasy Republic has effected an arrangement looking toward its
                        independence this summer, and other states of the French Community such as
                        Dahomey, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast and Mauritania may follow their example
                        soon thereafter. Sierra Leone will shortly begin discussions with the
                        British regarding terms for its independence.</p>
                    <p>3. The political stability of the area faces severe trials as the remaining
                        territories achieve independence, frequently accompanied by the tribal
                        rivalries and external political pressures. At present the pace of political
                        change is being set by a very small educated elite. The trend in most
                        countries is toward domination by a single party and growing
                        authoritarianism in government. Communism has not yet become a strong force
                        in West African politics, and, except in the Malagasy Republic, there are no
                        known Communist parties in the area. However, during the early days of
                        independence, the opportunities for Communist penetration and influence are
                        likely to increase and complicate an already difficult situation and make
                        more difficult the area’s continuing identification with the West.</p>
                    <p>4. In this connection, the West will have to contend with a growing Communist
                        Bloc effort to gain influence in West Africa and to exploit anti-colonial
                        sentiments. The Bloc has already established diplomatic missions and
                        established economic and trade links with both Ghana and Guinea, and we can
                        expect a rising tempo of such activities, as well as offers of credits, in
                        other newly independent countries. A concerted Communist effort is also
                        being made with some degree of success to cultivate and subvert African
                        students in Europe and the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>5. West African leaders are jealous of their new-found political power and
                        are unlikely to surrender it to elements not under their control. In the
                        longer run, however, the efforts of younger leaders to obtain increased
                        political power at the expense of the present political leadership could
                        create a situation favorable to the growth of Communism.</p>
                    <p>6. Most new West African countries will probably adopt more or less
                        neutralist foreign policies and seek to avoid cold war entanglements,
                        although their underlying orientation may in fact remain more pro-Western
                        than their official pronouncements suggest. Most African leaders have
                        indicated a preference for Western assistance. However, some may turn to the
                        Communist Bloc for aid, not only if they feel the West has not been
                        sufficiently responsive to their needs, but also as a means of emphasizing
                        their neutrality. Many of the new West African nations will probably also
                        succumb to the temptation to play off the West against the East.</p>
                    <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0149"/>
                    <p>7. Within West Africa there are various schemes directed toward preventing
                        the further “balkanization” of the area. They range in content from
                        combinations to maintain common public services, through loose political
                        alliances, to plans for Federal union. With independence, however, the
                        political benefits envisaged in most of these schemes have become
                        considerably less attractive to many national leaders who regard such
                        schemes as an infringement on their newly-won independence. Over the longer
                        term, the less glamorous economic measures may provide a more solid basis
                        for regional cooperation.</p>
                    <p>8. If an orderly development of the countries of West Africa with a Western
                        orientation and in cooperation with their former European metropoles is to
                        be assured, it is important that the traditional economic ties which bind
                        Western Europe and Africa be maintained and that every effort be made to
                        encourage the former Metropolitan powers to continue economic and technical
                        assistance. On the other hand, strong anti-colonial sentiments will linger
                        and will make certain of the new countries reluctant to remain exclusively
                        dependent upon their former metropoles.</p>
                    <p>9. The policies of the former metropoles regarding their ex-dependencies
                        vary. The United Kingdom, which has provided economic assistance in the
                        past, has explicitly acknowledged its willingness to continue public and
                        private aid to less-developed members of the Commonwealth, and in September
                        1958 the U.K. Government announced new measures under which
                        newly-independent members of the Commonwealth would continue to be eligible
                        for development assistance loans from the U.K. Government. The British have
                        also indicated a willingness to provide technical assistance grants to
                        newly-independent Commonwealth countries. The French have said they are
                        willing to continue helping independent members of the Community such as
                        Mali which are willing to remain associated with France and who continue to
                        support France in their foreign policies. However, former French colonies
                        such as Guinea which choose to break with France, lose their claim on direct
                        French development assistance, although some forms of indirect aid have
                        continued. Such colonies also relinquish their claims on Common Market
                        development funds. It is probable, therefore, that both the United Kingdom
                        and France will continue to extend aid on a unilateral basis to their former
                        colonies in Africa. It would be unrealistic, however, to look to the British
                        and French Governments exclusively as sources of external assistance to
                        their respective former dependencies in the area. In any event, probably
                        U.K. and French assistance will be far short of the needs for outside public
                        assistance which many of the former dependencies will <pb n="120"
                            xml:id="pg_120" facs="0150"/>probably feel they will require. Moreover,
                        for reasons of political prestige and to reinforce their position of
                        independence, the independent African countries will seek to develop other
                        sources of aid.</p>
                    <p>10. The West African economy is characterized by the predominance of
                        subsistence agriculture of very low productivity. In some areas (almost
                        entirely limited to certain of the countries along the coast), impressive
                        gains have been made in such export crops as cocoa, coffee, palm products,
                        peanuts and rubber. As a result, some areas have accumulated substantial
                        foreign exchange holdings; notably, Nigeria and Ghana which have reserves of
                        about $600 million and $500 million respectively. Throughout the area,
                        efforts to increase the efficiency of food production have brought very
                        slight results because of the lack of technical knowledge and capital,
                        resistance to new methods, the system of communal land ownership, and
                        unfavorable soil and climatic conditions.</p>
                    <p>11. The best prospects for long-term economic growth seem to lie in the
                        further development of known mineral resources—iron in Mauritania, Guinea,
                        Sierra Leone, Liberia and Gabon; bauxite in Ghana and Guinea; scattered
                        deposits of diamonds in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia; and manganese in
                        Gabon. Modest oil deposits have been found in Nigeria and Gabon. The area’s
                        hydro-electric resources have so far been exploited only in Cameroun, but
                        plans for major installations are in an advanced state in Ghana, Guinea, and
                        the Congo Republic. However, the problem of financing remains largely
                        unresolved.</p>
                    <p>12. American economic interests in West Africa are modest. In 1959 this area
                        accounted for only about one per cent of U.S. trade (about $276 million).
                        American investment in the area is approximately $225 million, but the
                        greater bulk of it is in Liberia where until recently most of the American
                        economic interest has focused.</p>
                    <p>13. Our primary strategic military interest in this area is to deny it to
                        Communist control. We now have no significant military requirements in this
                        area. However, control of sea and air communications in this and surrounding
                        areas might become important to us in certain emergency situations, and U.S.
                        requirements for installations, rights, and facilities in this area might
                        develop with technological advances in weapons systems.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Objectives</p>
                    <p>14. Maintenance of the Free World orientation of the area and denial of the
                        area to Communist domination, including:</p>
                    <p>a. The minimization of Communist influences therein.</p>
                    <p>b. Orderly economic development and political progress by the countries of

                    <p>c. Access to such military rights and facilities and such strategic resources
                        as may become necessary to our national security.</p>
                    <p>d. Formation of federations or other larger political groupings of the
                        nations of the area.</p>
                    <p>Regional Policy Guidance</p>
                    <p>15. Impress on the countries of Western Europe, including the metropoles or
                        former metropoles, the continuing importance to them of a stable and
                        prosperous West Africa and conduct all U.S. activities with a realization
                        that a continued close Eur-African relationship is important to the United
                        States itself. Similarly, impress on the West Africans the fact that their
                        national well-being depends in large part on a continued close economic and
                        cultural relationship with Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>16. In applying the policy guidance which follows to all parts of this area
                        except Guinea and Liberia, urge the Western European nations to expand their
                        efforts to influence and support their respective dependent and recently
                        independent areas and, to the extent feasible, to exercise primary
                        responsibility for providing such influence and support, so long as this
                        policy is consistent with U.S. national security interests. Seek to reach an
                        understanding along the above lines with appropriate Western European
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>17. Until an area achieves independence conduct U.S. activities and programs
                        in the area in full recognition of the responsibilities of the metropolitan
                        power involved, and, to the extent feasible:</p>
                    <p>a. Consult with the responsible metropolitan power on U.S. activities and
                        programs in or relating to the area; and</p>
                    <p>b. Avoid actions in the area or directly relating to the area likely to cause
                        serious misunderstandings between the United States and the metropolitan
                        power involved.</p>
                    <p>18. In the event it does not appear feasible or consistent with U.S. national
                        security interests for the European power concerned to exercise primary
                        responsibility in a dependent area or a newly-independent area, be prepared
                        to provide influence and support for such an area, taking into account:</p>
                    <p>a. The need for establishing friendly working relationships with the
                        newly-emerging state.</p>
                    <p>b. The need to incline this state toward the Free World rather than the
                        Communist world.</p>
                    <p>c. The effect of our policies on other Free World States having a colonial
                        heritage.</p>
                    <p>d. The need for maintaining Free World harmony including friendly
                        relationships and consultations as appropriate with the present or former
                        metropolitan powers.</p>

                    <p>19. Pursue actions which will assist newly-independent areas to maintain a
                        Western orientation, mindful of the natural desires and intense
                        sensitivities of the Africans, particularly with respect to their
                        newly-acquired independence. Make clear wherever possible that
                        self-government and independence impose increasing responsibilities which
                        the people must assume.</p>
                    <p>20. Encourage expansion of those United Nations activities in the area and

                        World.</p>
                    <p>22. Encourage friendly relations between the nations and territories of West
                        Africa and between those nations and territories and other African
                        countries. Encourage friendly relations between West African nations and the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>23. As appropriate, encourage the formation of federations or other forms of
                        association among the newly-emerged states which will enhance their
                        political and economic viability.</p>
                    <p>24. As feasible, support constructive, non-Communist nationalist and reform
                        movements, balancing the nature and degree of such support, however, with
                        consideration of our relations with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                    <p>25. Discourage wherever possible, expansionist tendencies and ethnic
                        xenophobia.</p>
                    <p>26. Recognizing the importance of non- and anti-Communist labor
                        organizations, as well as farmer’s, business and similar organizations to
                        the political and economic development of Free World-oriented African
                        societies, encourage such organizations to follow courses of action
                        consistent with U.S. interests and the needs of the African people.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Racialism</p>
                    <p>27. Encourage American companies to set an example in practicing
                        non-discrimination to the maximum extent and to train Africans in managerial
                        positions.</p>

                    <p>28. Seek to correct distorted African views of U.S. race relations,
                        emphasizing, where appropriate, progress made by the United States in the
                        race relations field.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Activities</p>
                    <p>29. Cooperate locally with security organizations to combat Communist
                        subversive activities.</p>
                    <p>30. Encourage, in independent areas where practicable, a full appreciation of
                        the dangers involved in formal Sino-Soviet Bloc representation, in extensive
                        use of Sino-Soviet Bloc technicians and in other Sino-Soviet Bloc economic
                        and cultural contacts. Alert the governments of such nations, without
                        causing false suspicions of our own objectives, to the probability that the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc will attempt to utilize trade and assistance programs as a
                        technique for political subversion. Nonetheless, maintain a flexible posture
                        that would minimize the damage to U.S. prestige in the event that such

                    <p>31. Keep the area under periodic survey to determine any changes in the U.S.
                        appraisal of the strategic value to the United States, bearing in mind that
                        the United States may, in the future, require bases, rights or
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>32. Discourage the development of an arms race in Africa and of the concept
                        that the United States is prepared to provide military assistance to any
                        nation which requests it. As countries in the area become independent,
                        encourage them to maintain adequately equipped and trained internal security
                        forces. In those cases where external assistance is required for this
                        purpose, encourage the appropriate former metropole to provide such

                        objectives, consider providing U.S. assistance to meet minimum legitimate
                        internal security requirements, including technical training in U.S.
                        military institutions.</p>
                    <p>33. Establish technically competent observers in African countries to keep
                        abreast of military or internal security developments, subject in each case

                        and to private investment to meet their needs for external capital so long
                        as this is consistent with U.S. security interests.</p>
                    <p>b. Urge the United Kingdom, France, Portugal and Spain as well as other Free

                        on the basis of case-by-case appraisal of country of major project
                        requirements to extend economic development assistance or special assistance

                        assistance. Accomplish this in part by conducting forthright discussions
                        with the metropoles and countries concerned as to the probable limitations
                        of U.S. assistance both as to type and amounts. Initiate such discussions

                        accelerate economic development by the selective application of skills to
                        the resources available; (4) serve multinational needs or are otherwise
                        regional in scope.</p>

                    <p>[Here follow a paragraph listing the participants at the meeting and agenda
                        items 1-3. Vice President Nixon presided at the meeting. The following
                        remarks were made during the discussion of item 4, “Future <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Agenda Items.”]</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> asked whether there were any
                        other suggestions for new agenda items. The Vice President said he had an
                        obsession about Africa. Nigeria, Togo and a host of other African countries
                        would soon become independent. He asked whether the Council was satisfied
                        that there was nothing more concerning Africa to be discussed prior to the
                        end of the present Administration, recalling that the President had
                        expressed the desire to leave a neat shop for the next administration. The
                        Vice President said he believed Africa was potentially the most explosive
                        area in the world today because the newly-independent countries there do not
                        know how to administer their affairs effectively. He realized the Council
                        had adopted two papers on Africa recently<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">
                            <ref target="#d22">Documents 22</ref> and <ref target="#d27"
                            >27</ref>.</note> but he felt some basic questions perhaps not covered
                        in these papers, such as whether we would or would not support dictatorships
                        in Africa, would form worthwhile questions for discussion by the Council.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the State Department
                        felt that Africa was more important than the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> papers indicated. He had made a statement emphasizing the
                        political significance of Africa at the last Council meeting and the
                        President had directed that <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> should keep
                        a closer watch on the implementation of our policy toward Africa than it <pb
                            n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0157"/> normally kept on the
                        implementation of a country paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d25">Document 25</ref>.</note> The significance of Africa
                        for the future was difficult to state succinctly in a paper. The Vice
                        President believed the recommendations to be left by the President to the
                        next administration as far as Africa was concerned should be in better shape
                        than at present. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he too felt strongly
                        about Africa and believed Africa should be added to the list of future
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> projects. The Vice President felt it
                        might be desirable to devote an entire meeting to a discussion on Africa.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed the Council might
                        hold the discussion on Africa without having before it a policy paper. The
                        Vice President agreed that discussion should take place on the basis of four
                        or five basic questions prepared by the Planning Board. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> said such a paper might focus on
                        long-range problems. The Vice President agreed, saying the long-range
                        problems might include the future orientation of African countries, what
                        countries would become independent, how subversion could be combated, etc.
                        In his view a “battle plan" for Africa was needed.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President then said he believed it was vitally important that Africa
                        be up-graded with respect to the assignment of U.S. personnel. There was a
                        great tendency to consider that the best U.S. overseas positions were in
                        Europe, Asia and Latin America. Africa was a horrible place but the
                        Department of State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, and <gloss
                            target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> needed to send high-caliber personnel to
                        Africa. He realized that State had made some progress in this direction; for
                        example, had established the principle that it would not necessarily send
                        black envoys to the black countries of Africa. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought personnel now being assigned
                        to Africa by the State Department was high-caliber. He said the embassies
                        being established in the newly-independent countries of Africa resulted in a
                        requirement for a great many more Foreign Service officers. The Department
                        of State had been unsuccessful in obtaining funds for this purpose from
                        Congress. The Vice President agreed that some Congressional action, such as
                        complaints about entertainment allowances for Foreign Service Officers, had
                        been disgraceful and a false economy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that politics was involved; the State Department
                        had asked for only $50,000 more but had been given only $10,000 accompanied
                        by a three-page dissertation on liquor. The Vice President believed that we
                        must realize that our information officers and diplomats need to take three
                        hours for lunch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said one
                        pressing need in Africa was more buildings for offices and living quarters.
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said his knowledge of
                        Africa was limited but he felt a Point Four type program was ideally suited
                        to Africa. He believed the people of Africa would respond to programs
                        emphasizing <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0158"/> human relations such
                        as medical care, assistance in growing better crops, etc.<note n="3"

                            February 23; <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 611.51/2–2360)</note> He said
                        we had discussed this problem among ourselves and would cooperate to the
                        fullest extent in our objective of consulting fully with the French. He
                        suggested that there should be at least weekly Franco-American meetings on
                        African matters in Washington. In response to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>’s inquiry as to the level of these
                        meetings, the Secretary indicated that they could be at the Ambassadorial
                        level when some policy matter was involved but that he would think of them
                        as being normally at a lower level when it was primarily a question of
                        exchanging information. He would envisage such exchanges as covering
                        material which was made available from the African posts and as including
                        material in a wide number of different fields. He noted this should be a
                        mutual exchange. He added that we, for our part, intended to make known to
                        all of the interested agencies of our Government that this program for
                        consultation with the French on African problems existed in order that we
                        might be kept fully informed and thus, in turn, keep the French informed.
                        The Secretary emphasized the need for secrecy if these discussions were to
                        succeed.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville said he thought the United States approach was a most
                        helpful one. The Secretary added that of course contacts between our two
                        Ambassadors in the various African posts in the field should continue. Couve
                        thought this would also be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Couve then turned to a discussion of African problems per se noting there
                        were two separate Africas and the French so bureaucratically divided them in
                        Paris, though he knew Africa was handled as a single bureau by us.</p>
                    <p>He said that all of Africa South of the Sahara was in a state of great
                        ferment with emphasis at the moment on the Union of South Africa but with
                        the turn of the Portuguese areas coming next year. Couve pointed out that
                        independence is the order of the day and although none of the African states
                        are ready for it, it is a fact that the West must accept. He said that the
                        Belgians were acting foolishly but he believed that they had no other choice
                        under the circumstances. He said he expected early independence for the
                        territories of East Africa such as Kenya and Tanganyika. The Foreign
                        Minister went on to say that this radical transformation of Africa must not
                        be opposed. While <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0160"/> the metropolitan
                        powers cannot keep ahead of it, it is essential that they keep even and this
                        is what the French are trying to do in the Community.</p>
                    <p>In describing the present concept of the Community, Couve said that the
                        original concept became outmoded immediately after its adoption and the
                        French are, therefore, engaged in a radical transformation of Community
                        structure with no idea whatsoever of opposing African demands.</p>
                    <p>Couve then defined French policy towards these new states as being predicated
                        around the necessity of defending vested French interests and preventing
                        chaos and Communism. He said he believed that European influence would be
                        extremely helpful in any defense against both chaos and Communism. Couve
                        then mentioned the agreements just concluded with Mali and the Malagasy
                        Republic in which the French recognized the full independence of these two
                            states.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">These agreements were concluded,
                            respectively, on April 2 and April 4, 1960. The French Constitution was
                            shortly thereafter amended to permit continued membership within the
                            Community subsequent to a declaration of independence. Mali, which was
                            the name Senegal and the Sudan selected when they merged in April 1959,
                            became independent on June 20, 1960, followed 6 days later by Madagascar
                            or the Malagasy Republic.</note> He said this independence would not be
                        qualified and that the new states would be full members of the United
                        Nations although remaining in the Community. He said that the Community
                        would probably develop into a sort of commonwealth with the important
                        difference that the President of the French Republic would automatically be
                        President of the Community although without specific powers.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville said that the agreements would provide for the
                        organization of diplomatic services for Mali and Malagasy although the
                        French will represent them where they have no embassies. Mali and Malagasy
                        have, he said, undertaken to consult with the French on important questions
                        of foreign policy and defense in order to reach a common position. He said
                        that each state will have a small national army of about 4,000 men for which
                        the French will pay. Both Mali and Malagasy have asked the French to
                        participate in their external defense although no formal alliance has been
                        signed. Couve then mentioned that the French would either own or continue to
                        use key strategic bases in both republics.</p>
                    <p>In the economic field, Couve said that Mali and the Malagasy Republic would
                        stay in the franc zone and that France would continue to pay for essential
                        requirements as in the past. French expenditures would be for economic
                        development, budgetary support and technical assistance.</p>
                    <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0161"/>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister went on to say that the French Government is now asking
                        Parliament to ratify these agreements which means they will also have to
                        amend the constitution since the latter document as it now stands does not
                        provide for the Community’s becoming an association of independent states.
                        Couve said that similar arrangements are now open for the rest of the
                        Community states. He pointed out that several of these states are undecided
                        about the degree of association there should be among themselves. They are
                        mostly, he explained, too small to survive alone but not yet ready to
                        abandon newly won perquisites of power. He said they are still thinking it
                        over although they understand they will have to amalgamate in one way or
                        another. Couve said he envisaged this amalgamation as taking the form of the
                        four states of former French Equatorial Africa getting together in some form
                        of federation or confederation; some regroupment among the non-Mali states
                        of former French West Africa not presently capable of being defined; and
                        Mauritania going it alone, since Mauritania has little affinity with the
                        Negro states of the south.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville then said that the emergence of these states raises
                        problems in US-French relations similar to those in North Africa,
                        particularly Morocco and Tunisia. He said that obviously these new states
                        would have full relations with the United States thus creating a problem of
                        competition between the two countries. He said that this is always a
                        difficult problem with the differences in language, consciously or
                        unconsciously, at the root of the trouble. Couve said that he thought some
                        of our differences arose from United States policy of associating aid with
                        over-all strategic policy. He said that he thought the best we could do at
                        the moment was to keep each other informed and try to work together avoiding
                        the impression that one state is taking the place of the other. Couve
                        promised that France would continue to give all aid to the Community states
                        sufficient for their needs and he called attention to the vast number of
                        French Civil Servants not only in the Community but also in North Africa and
                        even in Guinea. Couve recapitulated by saying that France would provide the
                        Community’s basic development needs through development loans, budgetary
                        support and the common market.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if in the agreements just signed with Mali and Malagasy
                        the French had undertaken to furnish absolutely everything those states
                        required. Couve replied that no long-term commitments had been made in
                        advance and aid to these republics would be handled on a year to year basis.
                        He said that France would provide all the two republics would need within
                        reason but possibly not all they themselves might feel they need.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that he wished to assure the French that the last thing
                        the United States wants to do is to remove the skills and culture which an
                        African state has learned from the Mother Country. <pb n="132"
                            xml:id="pg_132" facs="0162"/>He said that the principal concern of the
                        United States was whether Africa is to become another battle ground between
                        the West and the Communist world. The Secretary expressed particular concern
                        over Chinese Communist influence as seen in Guinea. He went on to say that
                        the African states themselves will try to see how much aid they can
                        stimulate by playing with both worlds.</p>
                    <p>Couve replied that this was the main reason for the French attitude towards
                        Guinea. Guinea, he said, is a Communist state. At the time Guinea refused to
                        join the Community, the country was already under Communist leadership and,
                        therefore, the French were obliged to cut all ties because of the impact of
                        Guinea’s neighbors. Couve said that French friends in Mali, etc., have
                        become more and more conscious of the fact that Guinea is a danger to them
                        and most Community leaders are well aware of the dangers of Communists,
                        Russians as well as Chinese. He then described a meeting in Paris between
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and a number of the
                        Community presidents in which the latter attacked <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> hard and the peril to Africa
                        imposed by Chinese expansionism.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visited France, March
                            23-April 3, 1960.</note> Couve said that both he and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> were very surprised at this
                        approach. Couve said that this showed the degree of awareness of the
                        Communist danger on the part of the Community leaders.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Couve whether he could estimate how the Algerian
                        situation is developing. Couve said it was difficult to respond, that
                        basically it was a matter of the French cease-fire offer not having been
                        accepted. On the military side, Couve said, the situation was better than a
                        year ago, in fact it had been transformed in recent months. Couve added that
                        this was not a solution to the political problem of Algeria, however, even
                        though it helped to have a sounder military situation. He said that the
                            <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> position had become more and more
                        rigid recently on the non-acceptance of a cease-fire. He referred to the
                        recent <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> call for volunteers and said that
                        closer contacts between the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> and the Red
                        Chinese had probably been motivated by the desire to impress the United
                        States. Couve said it was not desirable at all that the Algerian war should
                        continue, but there was no effort by the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>
                        to end it. He thought there had been a real chance to end the war some
                        months ago at the time of the cease-fire offer in September, but he noted
                        that the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> had never at any point made an
                        attempt to enter into discussions with the French on that basis.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked if there was some change in the September program of
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> in the light of
                        Prime Minister Debré’s speech earlier in the week when he spoke of partition
                        of Algeria. The Secretary thought this was the first time this concept had
                        been referred <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0163"/> to openly. Couve
                        said that the idea of partition had been mentioned in <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>’s September 16 declaration and
                        had been discussed at that time by the <gloss target="#t_FLN1"
                            >FLN</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">Documentation on North Africa
                            and Algeria is included in volume XIII.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Couve then asked for the United States evaluation of the situation in South
                        Africa. The Secretary replied that South Africa has been a volcano for many
                        years and it is amazing that it has not exploded sooner. The Secretary said
                        that he saw no sign of any amelioration of the situation and felt it would
                        affect all of subsaharan Africa. Couve expressed the opinion that he did not
                        believe events in South Africa would have any serious repercussions except
                        in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and possibly in Kenya.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then briefly mentioned the serious problem imposed by the
                        sudden emergence of the Belgian Congo which finds itself with serious
                        financial problems at the very moment of independence. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that costs in the Congo have
                        risen sharply in the last few months. Couve replied that this was true but
                        the Congo is a relatively rich territory. Couve said that the problem is
                        compounded by the fact that with independence, governmental control often
                        breaks down with many Africans assuming that there is no longer any need to
                        pay taxes. He then asked whether the United States has any programs in mind
                        for aid to the Belgian Congo or Mali. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> replied that the basic concern of the United States
                        is to see the African territories develop in freedom and stay in the free
                        world. He said that in view of the heavy responsibility which the United
                        States has elsewhere, it does not wish to do anything it does not have to
                        and, therefore, hopes that the rest of the free world, particularly the
                        former metropoles, will continue to carry the major portion of the burden of
                        aiding Africa. Nevertheless, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said, the new African states clearly want some sort
                        of connection with the United States as a symbol of their independence. In
                        this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked
                        what the French attitude would be toward any American technical cooperation
                        in economic development problems. He said he realized that the Belgian Congo
                        was a different case, since the Belgians had specifically asked us to come
                        in. He said Prime Minister Debré had told him that the Community states
                        would want something from the United States and it would, therefore, be
                        useful if we could coordinate our programs, although it appears to him that
                        French plans were fairly inclusive and the United States did not wish to
                        push in on them. Couve agreed that independence for African states involved
                        consideration of United States aid programs but pointed out that there were
                        existing organizations such as the common market which could also play a
                        major role. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he
                        believed technical education should have first priority throughout Africa,
                        to which Couve replied <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0164"/>that the
                        problem of language was a very serious one. He asked that United States
                        officials keep in touch with the French on any programs which might envisage
                        this field.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary called attention to the contrast between the French policy and
                        that of the Italians in Somalia and the Belgians in the Congo, where these
                        two metropoles appear desirous of unloading everything on the United States.
                        He said that he feared this might create a precedent which will impel the
                        leaders of the Community states to feel they should be entitled to United
                        States aid simply because other African countries are receiving it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Saccio called attention to the Special Program for Tropical Africa for
                        which money has been requested from Congress for raising technical skills
                        throughout Africa. He pointed out that no decision has been taken as to how
                        to divide this fund between English and French speaking areas.</p>
                    <p>Couve again called attention to the language difficulty and said it would not
                        be easy for the United States to carry out educational programs in French
                        speaking areas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied
                        that there is an intense desire to learn English throughout Africa and
                        pointed out that because the United States had not been able to move quickly
                        in Guinea, the latter had engaged Russian English teachers. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the United States is now
                        prepared to send English teachers to Guinea without a technical cooperation
                        agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>
                        expressed the opinion that it was extremely important that English and
                        French be maintained as the major languages in Africa South of the Sahara.
                        He stressed the point that the United States does not wish to appear to
                        compete with the French nor to displace the French language.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that in
                        considering the Community, the United States hoped that France would
                        encourage the various republics to stay in as large units as possible. He
                        said that the United States realized that they probably all desired United
                        Nations membership but that we hoped the French could encourage them to
                        group themselves into a maximum of three units. Couve replied that the
                        French agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                        >Satterthwaite</persName>’s point but that it was a very delicate question
                        and one in which the French had lost their power to intervene directly. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> asked concerning
                        former French Equatorial Africa, wondering whether it would apply for <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership as a single state. In reply, the
                        Foreign Minister said that that is the idea of the Equatorial Africans at
                        the moment, but that they may have some difficulty in obtaining acceptance
                        by the United Nations if they do not actually represent a single government
                        or a single state. He doubted that this area would become independent before
                        next year in any event and said that the capital of whatever federation that
                        they be would be located at Pointe Noire.</p>
                    <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0165"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> referred to the
                        question of arms control and said he assumed that France would only support
                        internal security forces in the Community republics. Couve answered that
                        this was indeed the case and that France had agreed to supply and equip an
                        army of 4,000 men each in both Mali and Malagasy. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> pointed out that the United
                        States is not anxious to supply arms to this part of Africa. The Secretary
                        said that the only alternative to the equipping of these forces by the
                        former metropoles would be smuggling and Couve agreed that the latter was
                        very hard to control.</p>
                    <p>M. Couve de Murville then expressed concern over developments in the horn of
                        Africa particularly with regard to the concept of a greater Somalia and said
                        that France was worried lest the dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia come
                        before the Security Council. The Secretary said he believed that this
                        problem would soon arise. Couve said that the question of the boundary with
                        Ethiopia was far from settled and that there could be trouble even in
                        northern Kenya where there is a substantial Somali population.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said that before concluding the meeting, he wished Mr.
                        Parsons to have the opportunity to express the Department’s opinion
                        concerning the problems of the new African states and the Chinese question.
                        Mr. Parsons said that it is clear that France and the United States share a
                        common concern regarding Communist China and that it is very useful to have
                        talks such as this. He said the question is becoming particularly urgent in
                        view of the appearance of the several new African states and said that the
                        Chinese Communists would make an extra effort: (1) to be invited to the
                        various independence ceremonies; (2) to claim diplomatic recognition; and
                        (3) to obtain African support to vote against the moratorium in the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Parsons went on to say that the African states are not fully informed
                        concerning the moratorium and he believed it would be helpful if the
                        opportunity could be seized to explain this issue to them well in advance of
                        independence. On the question of recognition, Mr. Parsons found the attitude
                        of the Cameroun excellent and said he felt that we had the opportunity to
                        follow this most useful formula in Togo. He said that he hoped new African
                        states would all understand that any premature decision with regards to
                        recognizing Communist China may not be wise and might have repercussions on
                        other states while not directly affecting the African states themselves.
                        Couve replied that he understood Mr. Parsons’ points and said that he
                        doubted that the Community republics would establish embassies in either
                        Peiping or Taipei. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>
                        asked whether the French believed that in the long run the Chinese
                        Communists represented a greater danger in Africa than the Russians since
                        they can claim to be non-white. Couve replied that he believed that this was
                        in fact a real problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> said that there was also a danger that <pb
                            n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0166"/>Chinese technicians in Africa would
                        prove to be more competent than the Russians. In reply, Couve said that
                        there was no question but that the Chinese Communists represented a very
                        real danger to Africa.</p>

                        United States in the area, recorded the following conclusions and
                        recommendations:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Political</p>
                    <p>1. It is imperative for the attainment of United States policy objectives,
                        which involve the denial of the area to Sino-Soviet bloc domination, that
                        the United States identify itself with the legitimate aspirations of the
                        peoples of Africa. Such identification involves in the first instance a
                        clear demonstration of U.S. sympathetic interest in their problems and
                        treatment of the new countries of Africa on a basis of equality. While
                        conventional diplomacy through personal contacts and public positions plays
                        an important role in establishing areas of common interest, economic aid
                        will be an increasingly necessary instrument for the attainment of United
                        States objectives in Africa.</p>
                    <p>2. The situation in Tropical Africa is distinguished by its special urgency
                        and its rapid, often unpredictable evolution. The period immediately before
                        and after the attainment of independence will be crucial for the
                        establishment of friendly and cooperative relations between the U.S. and the
                        new African nations. Early and effective action in responding to the needs
                        of such countries can be more economical than action at a later time: one
                        dollar spent now may well be as useful <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137"
                            facs="0167"/>to the U.S. interest as ten dollars spent two years from
                        now. In general, the attitudes initially created in the new nations are
                        likely to have a long-lasting influence on their positions and policies in
                        the world at large and in the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>3. Regarding Algeria, the Conference noted with concern the unlikelihood of
                        an early settlement of the war and the grave menace which the continuation
                        of this conflict represents for the furtherance of U.S. interests throughout
                        Africa. It also took note of the continuing effort of the Sino-Soviet Bloc,
                        and especially the Red Chinese, to acquire influence in the <gloss
                            target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>. It considered this indicative of
                        Sino-Soviet intention to ensure a Communist presence and influence in
                        Algeria if and when a settlement of the Algerian problem is achieved. The
                        Conference felt that while the U.S. had understandably refrained from
                        becoming deeply involved in this delicate and difficult problem, we should
                        nonetheless remain alert to the possibility of making a definite
                        contribution toward a settlement. Such a contribution might bring about a
                        change of current opinion in Africa, which seems to associate the United
                        States closely with the French war effort. The Conference also felt that if
                        prospects for a settlement improve, the United States should begin a careful
                        examination of possible steps to influence the future orientation of the
                        Algerian area of North Africa, bearing in mind that circumstances could so
                        develop as to make speedy action imperative.</p>
                    <p>4. The Conference devoted much time to discussion of the problems posed for
                        the West, and for the achievement of our objectives in Africa, by French
                        policies and attitudes in Africa South of the Sahara. While recognizing the
                        need to conciliate France in view of its staunch position in Europe, the
                        conferees wished to record their view that this conciliation, if carried too
                        far, will impair and might even jeopardize the effectiveness of our effort
                        in Africa.</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to the creation or maintenance of larger African political
                        groupings, the United States should continue to support the idea of greater
                        African unity, recognizing, however, that this is not an immediate prospect
                        and that the present trend in Africa is in a direction of national rather
                        than supra-national aspirations. The United States should be careful not to
                        endorse prematurely any specific proposals for African unity that may be put
                        forth by African leaders. In this connection it was the view of the
                        Conference that the Garvey-DuBois-Nkrumah classical Pan-African concept
                        appears to be a declining force.</p>
                    <p>6. The entry into the United Nations of a sizable number of new African
                        states will have an impact on U.S. participation in that organization. The
                        Conference noted the importance of early discussions with <pb n="138"
                            xml:id="pg_138" facs="0168"/>the leaders of the emerging states to
                        provide them with essential background on key United Nations issues and to
                        promote a sympathetic understanding of the United States approach to these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>7. There is no U.S. strategic requirement for the buildup of indigenous armed
                        forces in Africa. The African states should be discreetly encouraged to
                        agree among themselves on some form of regional arms limitation and control.
                        The U.S. may, however, have to provide military assistance, limited as far
                        as possible to internal security requirements, to forestall the Sino-Soviet
                        bloc in some African countries.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Economic</p>
                    <p>1. With respect to United States aid policies in general, the Conference
                        noted the recent shift in emphasis from grant aid to loans, which may
                        reflect a reasonable adjustment to the great changes that have occurred in
                        the world economy as a result of United States aid over a long period. The
                        Conference expresses the belief, however, that the requirements of Africa,
                        although uniquely African, correspond more to those which existed in Europe
                        fifteen years ago or in South and Southeast Asia five years ago. If our aid
                        is to be effective in Africa, our policies and aid instruments must be
                        adjusted to the particular situation prevailing there. This may require
                        departures from established present world-wide policies and aid patterns and
                        a return, in the case of Africa, to patterns and practices that were applied
                        successfully elsewhere at an earlier time.</p>
                    <p>2. Because the needs of the new African countries are very extensive and
                        varied, an attempt to meet all of them would be self-defeating. Although
                        some U.S. assistance to all the new countries is desirable and necessary,
                        the U.S. must be selective in its approach, taking into account also the
                        important aid programs of some of the former metropolitan powers which
                        continue to have important interests in the new African countries. While the
                        United States must continue to urge that aid from the metropoles be
                        maintained and if possible increased, there is no assurance that such aid
                        will in fact continue. Therefore a number of crisis situations may arise in
                        Africa through the creation of vacuums into which Soviet and other Communist
                        aid could flow on a massive scale.</p>
                    <p>3. It was the belief of the Conference that the greatest dangers appear to
                        exist at the moment in Guinea, Cameroun, Togo and Mali (in addition to the
                        Belgian Congo which was not in the area covered by this Conference and
                        where, as in Guinea, we are already faced with such a crisis). In the case
                        of Cameroun and Togo, which are now fully independent, the United States
                        should inquire about the aid plans of the French Government and should urge
                        France to continue its assistance. If it appears that France is preparing to
                        exact political concessions from those countries in return for aid and that
                        those concessions <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0169"/>are being
                        refused, the United States should be prepared to step in with the aid
                        programs required to avoid a repetition of the situation that arose in
                        Guinea. Account should also be taken of cases where there is a lack of
                        receptivity to aid from the former metropoles.</p>
                    <p>4. If the objectives of United States policy in the area are to be attained,
                        American assistance must be timely and responsive not only to African
                        economic and internal security needs and to U.S. security requirements but
                        also to African political requirements which may well involve departures
                        from aid patterns in less primitive or more stable countries. United States
                        assistance should create a climate which will engage the expectations of the
                        leadership in a Western direction so that the countries of the area will not
                        be tempted to look upon Sino-Soviet bloc aid as essential for the solution
                        of their problems.</p>
                    <p>5. The United States should seek strengthened multilateral aid programs
                        including programs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, but
                        such programs can be no more than a modest supplement to United States
                        bilateral programs. The United States should also explore the possibility of
                        some coordinating mechanism for aid to Africa which could maximize resources
                        available from the former metropoles and other potential donors while giving
                        the African countries a forum in which to discuss and coordinate their aid
                        requirements. Since the realization of such a plan involves many
                        difficulties and since the situation requires both flexibility and speed,
                        the United States should not permit consideration of such new patterns to
                        delay the establishment and implementation of bilateral programs which would
                        continue in any case even if a multilateral “umbrella” were erected over
                        them.</p>
                    <p>6. The strong conviction was expressed that certain provisions of our
                        standard bilateral agreements for technical and economic assistance
                        represent definite liabilities. Reference was made especially to provisions
                        dealing with diplomatic privileges and immunities for personnel of aid
                        missions and for contract employees. Several participants from posts in
                        North and West Africa declared that such provisions represent not only
                        irritants but dangers for the reception of our aid programs and for our
                        relations with those countries. It was also noted that in many countries
                        special privileges for American technicians might upset relationships for
                        thousands of technicians from former metropoles who do not enjoy similar
                        privileges and whose continued presence in those countries is essential.
                        (The same difficulties arise with respect to privileges and immunities for
                        personnel of U.S. Government agencies other than <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss>–e.g. Defense, <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_FBIS1">FBIS</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>7. The United States should be prepared to waive certain formalities which
                        are not absolutely necessary, especially when such formalities would involve
                        delays in critical situations. African countries cannot be expected to
                        analyze their needs or to submit detailed <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                            facs="0170"/>justifications for aid requests because in many cases they
                        do not know their real needs and do not know how to analyze them. In some
                        cases <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> should be prepared to act promptly
                        on obvious needs without waiting for formal written requests from recipient
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>8. The Conference also expressed itself in favor of a relaxation of the
                        formalities attending the initiation of <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss>
                        loan applications. These formalities represent a serious obstacle to the
                        attainment of our objectives and reduce even further the utility of this aid
                        instrument in the African context.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Cultural and Information</p>
                    <p>1. There is a need for greatly expanded information and cultural activities
                        in Africa especially tailored for the various regions. The Conference
                        expressed its hope that United States Information Service posts in the newly
                        emerging countries will be fully manned, equipped and financed in the
                        shortest possible time.</p>
                    <p>2. One element of primary importance for the achievement of American policy
                        objectives in Africa is a wider dissemination of knowledge of the English
                        language. As far as the former French dependencies are concerned, however,
                        this encounters a special degree of sensitivity and resentment on the part
                        of the French Government. It was concluded that the United States must,
                        without renouncing its objective of creating a wider knowledge of English in
                        the countries concerned, take into account the attitudes of the French
                        Government; that, accordingly, it cannot be our policy or program to move
                        forward on a broad front and with an intensive effort in all cases; but
                        that, rather, an ad hoc approach is indicated, moving forward wherever
                        French sensitivities appear less intense and stressing, in all cases, that
                        it is not our purpose to displace or diminish the French cultural influence
                        in the countries involved.</p>
                    <p>3. Better coordination and planning are required between the various programs
                        that bring Africans on visits to the United States. Contract agencies should
                        be particularly careful to so arrange grantee programs as to minimize the
                        danger of racial incidents. It was noted that different treatment of
                        grantees in various different categories can give rise to invidious
                        comparisons which are harmful to the program. It was also noted that the
                        effectiveness of visits to the United States is reduced when they involve
                        many short visits in different parts of the country rather than fewer and
                        more intensive visits. Grantees should be discouraged from making
                        excessively ambitious plans for travel in the United States when the length
                        of their visit will be limited.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0171"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Administrative</p>
                    <p>1. Unconventional situations require unconventional methods to deal with
                        them. In African hardship posts we are sometimes confronted with such
                        situations. Unusual requests from African posts must be viewed in this light
                        and deserve more than reference to applicable procedures and
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>2. With respect to building operations, the situation in Africa requires a
                        much greater degree of flexibility on the part of <gloss target="#t_FBO1"
                            >FBO</gloss>. In many cases the need for housing is so pressing, and
                        opportunities for rental are so limited or even non-existent, that <gloss
                            target="#t_FBO1">FBO</gloss> should be placed in a position to construct
                        authorized housing on a crash basis in a period of months rather than
                        years.</p>
                    <p>3. Recognizing that the present budgetary situation of <gloss
                            target="#t_FBO1">FBO</gloss> severely limits the initiation of new
                        construction projects or the purchase of office and living quarters, the
                        Conference felt that the attention of Congress should be directed to the
                        fact that in many African countries annual rentals are designed to amortize
                        a building in three or four years, and where we are left with no
                        alternative, our payments of rent unavoidably result in a much larger
                        expenditure of public funds over a period than would be involved if we
                        constructed or purchased buildings.</p>
                    <p>4. With respect to tours of duty, it was felt that greater flexibility is
                        needed at hardship posts especially in the case of clerical personnel after
                        one year, even within the area, since the change alone would revive morale
                        and stimulate new interest.</p>
                    <p>5. The Conference noted the utility of area training for Africa. It agreed,
                        on the other hand, that there is little merit in training personnel in
                        African languages since English and French are usually the official
                        languages and are spoken by members of the elite and by significant elements
                        of the populations; whereas African dialects are of limited utility not only
                        geographically but even within particular communities. However, increased
                        study of French by personnel proceeding to French-speaking African posts was
                        found very desirable.</p>

                        to Ethiopian Foreign Minister Yilma Deressa in his capacity as chairman of
                        the Conference of Independent African States. The draft message reads as

                        self-government is most gratifying. In your efforts at this Conference to

                    <p>The United States viewed the impending conference as “potentially the most

                    <p>I wish to thank you for the interest you have taken in our Conference at
                        Tangier, for your attendance there and the contribution you made, and for
                        the time and trouble you have taken in setting down your impressions in
                        writing. At the same time, however, my impressions of the consensus of the
                        Conference differ in important respects from those in your memorandum of
                        June 2 which you sent me on June 16.<note n="1" xml:id="d32fn1">Not printed.
                                (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>First of all, it is my conclusion that the Conference showed a clear
                        consensus that we will not be able to prevent Communist economic penetration
                        of the African continent but are setting as our objective to keep Communist
                        contacts and influence within reasonable bounds, i.e., to prevent the
                        penetration of sensitive sectors and to avoid conditions in which African
                        nations will turn to the Bloc for massive aid. It seems to me that this was
                        brought out quite clearly in my opening statement in which I interpreted the
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> objectives. While these objectives
                        do not apparently seem sufficient to you, I think there was no uncertainty
                        about them at the Conference.</p>
                    <p>You state in your memorandum that “Conceivably, if the Western powers were
                        really determined to exclude the Soviet, and were pre-pared to meet all
                        reasonable African desires for development (not always existent) quickly and
                        painlessly, Soviet penetration might be confined or restricted if not
                        prevented.” Your memorandum, further-more, seems to set up the alternatives
                        of either having such a comprehensive and all-inclusive program or else
                        accepting defeat in certain areas of Africa while concentrating on others
                        where the prospects are more promising. I do not agree with such artificial
                        alternatives, and wonder whether upon reflection you will not agree that we
                        are not really caught up in such a dilemma.</p>
                    <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0174"/>
                    <p>There is a tendency, I think, for some officers in the Department to feel
                        that it is the task of the United States Government to create conditions in
                        Africa where the Soviets will have no opportunities at all to give economic
                        aid. However, the requirements of the African continent are so great that we
                        are in my opinion bound to be defeated if we set for ourselves such an
                        overly ambitious objective. If we tried to meet all African requirements we
                        would only scatter our resources and encourage African countries to invite
                        the Soviets and the West to the kind of competitive bidding in which we
                        would soon find ourselves in the position of gamblers having to double the
                        stakes in order to keep in the game. I do not believe this would be
                        realistic or wise.</p>
                    <p>I think I detect a note of impatience, if not of irony, in your memorandum
                        where you purport to summarize our discussions of French aid to African
                        countries. (“Great uncertainty seemed to exist as to what should be done in
                        any case.” “It was not very clear how the anticipated erroneous French views
                        would differ from ours … “)<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">All ellipses are in
                            the source text.</note> Actually, I think the Conference brought out
                        very clearly that our commitment to consult with the French about aid to
                        their present or former dependencies constitutes a serious but unavoidable
                        policy problem, but that the French have a right to ask for such
                        consultations because they are at present pumping half a billion dollars a
                        year into Africa and are extending the kind of massive assistance in
                        personnel services which the United States would be quite unable to provide.
                        The Conference noted that it would be a fatal mistake for us to jeopardize
                        such assistance by trying to charge forward in spite of French objections.
                        Our major problem, as was brought out again and again at the Conference, is
                        to gear ourselves to move in quickly if the French permit a vacuum to be
                        created as in Guinea. This is, of course, a contingency situation. I realize
                        that such situations make your job more difficult, and perhaps the tone of
                        your memorandum reflects some frustration that we have not been able to make
                        it easier. However, there is no use fighting the problem: The French do have
                        a large program of assistance in Africa and we must be concerned, first of
                        all, with maintaining that program.</p>
                    <p>Your memorandum seems to reflect a certain disappointment that the Tangier
                        Conference did not call for an especially large US aid program. It is true
                        that we reached no such conclusion. At the same time, however, the
                        Conference did express itself quite clearly that we are confronted with a
                        crisis situation in Africa; that early US action to engage the expectations
                        of the new countries in a Western direction would be of vital importance;
                        that “ten million dollars spent now may well be worth one hundred million
                        spent two years from now;” that action on our part should not wait for the
                        creation of some concerted <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0175"/>Western
                        mechanism for assistance; that the present aid instruments are not suited to
                        the situation in Africa and that we should be prepared to revert in some
                        instances to instruments that have been used successfully in other parts of
                        the world at earlier times (including grant aid and where necessary
                        budgetary support); and that we should be alive to situations where Soviet
                        actions would necessitate our preempting certain sensitive sectors.</p>
                    <p>You state that the “major impediment to further Bloc penetration appears to
                        be only the lack of a firm Soviet decision to move in.</p>
                    <p>Certainly opportunities for penetration are obvious, numerous, almost made to
                        order … “I strongly believe that the same opportunities also exist for the
                        United States. The trouble is, as I see it, that the United States
                        Government seems to be unwilling to budget sufficient funds to enable us to
                        pre-empt sensitive sectors and to fire at targets of opportunity, which is
                        precisely what the Soviets seem to be preparing to do. Since we cannot
                        occupy all positions, planning on a contingency basis seems essential—but it
                        is just this principle which is being continuously denigrated.</p>
                    <p>Nor can I agree at all with your statement that “one gets the impression our
                        people are, if not content with this limited pattern (reliance on technical
                        cooperation, cultural exchange and old-fashioned diplomacy), at least not
                        prepared to urge strongly a larger action program or to define their ideas
                        as to what might be effective.” The difficulty, rather, seems to be that you
                        and others in the Department expect us to come up with concrete plans for
                        aid on either a continent-wide or a country-to-country basis, failing which
                        it is felt that we cannot go to Congress and ask for the necessary funds to
                        counter the anticipated major Soviet effort in Africa. I do not believe it
                        realistic to expect this kind of neat programming precision in a fast-moving
                        situation when there are so many unknown and variable factors.</p>
                    <p>You state “no impression was given me that our representatives have very much
                        information or assessment of the Soviet intentions in such matters.” That is
                        entirely correct, and it is the reason why we may be defeated in Africa if
                        detailed information of this kind is a precondition for United States
                        preparation for action. You also state that “The strategic significance or
                        political importance of the area seemed to be viewed in low key, especially
                        by the Washington <gloss target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss> representatives, who
                        cannot be accused of encouraging grandiose schemes.” I am afraid that such
                        sentences convey an entirely inaccurate impression of the proceedings in
                        Tangier. Surely, the encouragement of “grandiose schemes” is not the only
                        measure of our seriousness in viewing the African situation.</p>
                    <p>I completely agree with you that we need better information, clearer analyses
                        of the problems, prompt and effective programs of political and economic
                        action, stronger staffs and clearer policy guidance. <pb n="146"
                            xml:id="pg_146" facs="0176"/>However, if we are going to wait until all
                        of these elements or conditions are met we will surely be defeated in
                        Africa. The solution does not lie in waiting until we have larger staffs in
                        Africa, have solved the problem of African technical education, have G–2–d
                        Soviet intentions in great detail—or in throwing up our hands in despair and
                        concentrating only on the most promising countries in Africa.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that we have a real difference of basic approach. Your
                        memorandum attempts to place on the Bureau of African Affairs and its field
                        representatives the blame for the inability of the United States to move
                        swiftly in a swift-moving situation in which not all the factors are known,
                        in which the intentions of our opponents are not yet quite clear, and where
                        neatly worked-out programs of the conventional kind cannot be prepared
                        quickly. I think we can work out a different approach together, and I
                        earnestly solicit your cooperation to that end. Perhaps you can think of
                        ways in which the findings of the Tangier Conference could be used to
                        document the urgent needs of the African area and the unique situation we
                        have there, so as to justify what someone at Tangier called “unconventional
                        solutions to unconventional problems” in Africa.</p>
                    <p>I greatly appreciate the comments you made about the personnel situation at
                        some of our African posts, and the need to beef up some of our posts so that
                        we can be better prepared for the emergencies that are sure to arise there
                        in many places. I know that I can count on your support in carrying our
                        requests to the highest levels in the Department if necessary.</p>
                    <p>Our report of the Tangier Conference, which sets forth its conclusions and
                        summarizes the proceedings in some detail, has been circulated to the field
                        and will be disseminated throughout the Department as soon as field comments
                        have been received. Meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could let me
                        know to whom, in addition to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
                        >Hare</persName>, your memorandum was disseminated, so that I may send
                        copies of this memorandum to them also.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Bell

                        course of this introduction, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>
                        noted that the Vice President was unable to attend the Council Meeting and
                        indicated that he would see that the Vice President was briefed on the
                        Council discussion. He then introduced Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that the State
                        Discussion Paper had been prepared as a talking paper. It indicated pretty
                        well what the situation is now and what problems we faced in Africa. When
                        the State paper had been discussed in the Planning Board, the Board had
                        developed sixteen questions on the basis of it. It would take too long,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated, to deal with
                        all of these questions in detail and some of them were somewhat repetitive,
                        but he would attempt to deal with three or four of the principal questions.
                        The main point to be made about Africa, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said, was the fairly obvious one
                        that the continent is in a state of extreme flux at present and that if the
                        U.S. was to react properly to the situation, we required maximum
                        flexibility. In all of our security operations—in military operations
                        through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or otherwise, diplomatic
                        actions, and in economic and other activities—we should emphasize doing what
                        needs to be done in a particular case rather than what accords with our
                        basic ideas as to the ideal way of handling the situation. Another thing
                        that was different <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0178"/>in Africa as
                        compared with other areas, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> suggested, was the need for and advantage of a
                        multilateral approach. The U.S. had backed the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> in the development of its unique position in the Congo and
                        we have to a large extent succeeded in keeping the Soviets out. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought the decision to
                        provide aid to the Congo through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                        the correct decision. As regards Africa generally, it was different from
                        other underdeveloped areas in that the former colonial powers had a real
                        interest in providing support. They are presently assisting the area to the
                        extent of $500 million per year and are ready to continue such assistance.
                        The U.S. position in Africa therefore was different from that in other
                        underdeveloped areas in that we were supporting other industrial countries
                        rather than assuming the main role. Another unique problem in Africa was the
                        lack of qualified U.S. personnel for service there.</p>
                    <p>With these general observations for background, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated he would now take up three or
                        four of the Planning Board questions. He read the first part of Question No.
                        2: “Should the U.S. and the Free World seek competitive or cooperative
                        relationships with the Soviet Union in Africa?” Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that in several areas of
                        Africa, the Soviets were trying to break in. To cooperate with them would
                        only cause them to get in earlier and easier. We had to compete, although
                        not on every program, country, or thing. We should pick out those things
                        that we could do best and concentrate on them, getting together with other
                        Free World nations on those things. The achievement of Free World
                        cooperation could be accomplished through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> or through the new assistance group. We should seek to
                        prevent the Soviets from gaining a major position in Africa although we will
                        have to adjust to some Soviet presence there.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> next read the second
                        part of Question No. 2: “If the U.S. is to compete, will our present
                        techniques satisfy the need to help the new African governments to limit and
                        control their contacts with the Bloc, including their development of
                        relations with Communist China, and especially to prevent their acceptance
                        of Bloc assistance in the military and other sensitive fields?” Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that U.S.
                        techniques are too cumbersome. This was partly because of the need to have
                        the same policy everywhere in the world and partly because of Congressional
                        and General Accounting Office requirements. We had to live up to these
                        requirements, but we also had to find ways to act quickly.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read the third
                        part of Question No. 2: “Should the U.S., in anticipation of Bloc efforts to
                        overthrow pro-Western regimes by subversive means, help the Africans to
                        develop adequate internal security forces, perhaps by increased emphasis on
                            <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0179"/>the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            programs were intended to develop forces adequate to provide internal

                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that 1290–d programs were
                        desirable where they would work but that they should not be undertaken for
                        all of Africa. They would work well in some countries, not in others.
                        Moreover, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated,
                        it might be necessary in a few countries, as it had been in Ethiopia, to
                        provide military assistance on a preclusive basis to keep the Soviets
                        out.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read the last
                        part of Question No. 2: “Would it be feasible to apply the principles of a
                        Free World “Monroe Doctrine” for Africa as a means of curbing Communist Bloc
                        influence?" The answer to this question, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated, was “no”. The African
                        states would resent it very much if outsiders announced such a doctrine for
                        Africa. Such action would promote the very things that we were against.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then proceeded to
                        Question No. 3: “Is neutralism in this area necessarily undesirable from the
                        point of view of U.S. interests?” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> stated that neutralism was not undesirable if the
                        countries were genuinely neutral—that is, friendly to the West and to free
                        enterprise. But if they went as far as Guinea, neutralism could be
                        undesirable. In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the U.S. should seek
                        the support of the African states on the majority of the issues in which we
                        are interested. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        noted our success in obtaining African support for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> actions relating to the Congo. The African states believe
                        that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has gone too far and are
                        in this case supporting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> against one of
                        their own people. Concluding his discussion of this point, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that neutralism was
                        better than Communism.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> turned next to
                        Question No. 10: “It is U.S. policy to encourage and, to the extent
                        feasible, rely on Western European nations to influence and support their
                        respective dependent and recently independent areas so long as such
                        encouragement and reliance are consistent with U.S. national interests. Is
                        this an adequate, realistic policy and is it still feasible in the light of
                        current developments in Africa?” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that the answer to the first part of this
                        question, relating to the adequacy and realism of the policy, was “yes”. The
                        answer to the second part was less clear. When the policy had been
                        developed, Guinea and Liberia were exceptions. Now we were faced by the same
                        thing in the Congo where we could not rely on Belgium. It was still our
                        objective to get the Belgians back into the Congo, but whether this was
                        practical we do not know. It is not practical at the moment, however. We
                        hope that the situation in the <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0180"
                        />Congo is a unique situation. The French have said that they can take care
                        of their own ex-colonies. Whether these colonies, as they become
                        independent, will continue friendly to France is a question. In particular,
                        it is questionable whether they will consistently support France in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If they do not, France may say that
                        it will not support them. The U.S. was working with the French, trying to
                        keep them in a position of supporting their ex-colonies; this was presently
                        their own policy. The position with respect to the British areas was at
                        present satisfactory. Nigeria was now independent and Sierra Leone would
                        become independent early in 1961. This would leave only East Africa in a
                        dependent status. Whether East African territories, as they become
                        independent, will be as friendly to the British as West African territories
                        was a real question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        indicated. Summing up, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> stated that the answer to the Planning Board question
                        therefore was that our present policy was the correct basic policy but that
                        it might not work everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read Question
                        No. 12: “In view of the current use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        in the Congo crisis, should we now plan to give increased emphasis to
                        multilateral economic aid and technical assistance throughout Africa? Is
                        existing machinery adequate or are new agencies required?” Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that he agreed that
                        increased emphasis should be given to a multilateral approach except with
                        respect to development assistance. The expanded <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> technical assistance program and <gloss target="#t_OPEX1"
                            >OPEX</gloss> were good programs. There were some real problems,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted, however, in
                        having assistance to Africa going through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. For example, there was the 50-50 shipping problem.<note
                            n="9" xml:id="d33fn9">Section 111 (A) (2) of the Economic Cooperation
                            Act of 1948 (P.L. 472), approved April 3, 1948, required that 50 percent
                            of the matériel provided as assistance be shipped on U.S. vessels. This
                            provision was carried forward in subsequent Mutual Security
                            legislation.</note> We might be able to work this out with the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by getting them to use some of our shipping.
                        However, we will have legislative problems if we provide more assistance
                        through multilateral channels and new legislation will probably be required
                        next year. The Africans have made proposals for new multilateral approaches
                        to aid. If such approaches are developed and the Africans move ahead on
                        them, State feels that we should support them. At present, however, we did
                        not know whether these proposals would get off the ground. This last
                        question and the question of personnel are of greatest importance. We
                        needed, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated, to
                        get together a list of people in the U.S. who are knowledgeable on Africa
                        and available for service there. There are not too many people in this
                        category and this is one of the reasons we have supported a multilateral
                        approach.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0181"/>
                    <p>Finally, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> turned to
                        Question No. 1: “What should the U.S. be prepared to do in the event of
                        anarchy or widespread rioting and bloodshed in other African states similar
                        to that which has occurred in the Congo? If reliance is to be placed on
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> emergency forces, are further
                        preparatory steps required?” Answering this question, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that we hoped this was not an
                        immediate problem. We believe that the Congo represents a unique situation.
                        However, in some of the British colonies (e.g. Rhodesia) and the Portuguese
                        colonies, we might in the long run be faced with such unfavorable
                        developments. There were two things, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> stated, on which we were taking action as a result of
                        the Congo experience. That experience indicated that our emergency
                        evacuation plan was inadequate. It was adequate for the immediate area of
                        the Congo, but not in taking account of the problems created in surrounding
                        areas into which the evacuees moved. A State-Defense team would go to Africa
                        in October and develop a better regional evacuation plan. However, despite
                        the strain that was placed upon the areas that received the evacuees, the
                        evacuation had gone very well. The second matter that was under
                        consideration was a Defense proposal that a small naval force with a few
                        marines might visit the area and might be available in an emergency to
                        assist with evacuation. This force would consist of four small naval
                        vessels. Such a group might go sailing around the coast of Africa as an
                        extension of the goodwill visit of the Commander, South Atlantic, to the
                        area a year or so ago.<note n="10" xml:id="d33fn10">Documentation on this

                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated, was required in

                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Emergency Force. The creation of a special
                        force for Africa would raise the question of white vs. non-white troops
                        which had already been raised by <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked whether Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> wished to add anything to
                        what he had said about the Planning Board questions. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> responded that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had generally covered them but that
                        there were a couple of matters he would like to mention. There was a
                        suggestion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said, that the
                        President might wish to consider the creation of an African Advisory
                        Commission similar to the Inter-American Commission. He recognized, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> stated, that this was a
                        debatable proposition. Secondly, against the background of difficulties
                            <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had experienced in recruiting a few
                        technicians for the Congo, should the U.S. institute a major program to
                        develop and recruit people <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0182"/>for
                        service in Africa? For example, would it be useful to make use of the
                        services of retired army officers in the area? Such action would require
                        legislation because retired army officers could not receive pay for such
                        work without giving up their retirement pay. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded to this last point by
                        stating that State was compiling a list of people available for service in
                        Africa. Once this list had been compiled, we might find that something more
                        was needed in the way of inducements; for example, income tax benefits. The
                        President stated that he did not see anything wrong with such benefits. In a
                        sense people working in Africa would be working for the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and income tax benefits were extended to
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> indicated that he would not object
                        to tax benefits. Treasury was supporting Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_BMW2">Boggs</persName>’ bill to extend tax benefits to those
                        who brought capital into underdeveloped countries. Such measures were all
                        right if they were limited in application to underdeveloped countries.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he agreed
                        in general with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>’s point with
                        respect to personnel but before we decided what we needed in the way of a
                        program, we would need to make a thorough study of what was available in the
                        way of human resources at present. He pointed out that <gloss
                            target="#t_MIT1">MIT</gloss> every year trained a class of about fifteen
                        people for work in underdeveloped countries and that when the present class
                        had been asked, eight had volunteered for service in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that he was
                        leery of proposals for creating a special commission on Africa. The
                        situation in Africa was different from that in Latin America. In Latin
                        America the U.S. has a very large number of contacts with labor, business
                        and intellectuals. In Africa, on the other hand, our contacts were very
                        limited. The number of people with direct knowledge of Africa or with
                        business in Africa was very limited. State did work with the very few
                        individuals who are knowledgeable about Africa. It worked with U.S.
                        businessmen in Liberia and Olin-Mathieson in Guinea. Beyond these there was
                        practically nobody. If you brought big business into such a commission, you
                        would simply be giving the Soviets something to shoot at. They would say
                        that we are exploiting Africans for our own business interests.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the problem of technicians, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> said that he had heard a figure of 30,000 as the number
                        of people required in the Congo. Whatever the U.S. did, we could obviously
                        do no more than scratch the surface of such a problem. Mr. Riddleberger
                        indicated that the figure 30,000 was too high; it was more like 10–15,000.
                        However, the question of how many people were required depended upon on how
                        far down in the hierarchy one went—for example, whether one included
                        traders. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that for this
                        reason we clearly needed a multilateral approach—we could not do the job
                        alone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that
                        in the Congo the only way we could solve the problem was to find some way to
                        bring the Belgians back in.</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0183"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> pointed out that
                        the Canadians had a number of people with 25–30 years experience in Africa
                        and that if they made a real effort they would be able to send some really
                        able people. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> went
                        on to say that when the Council had earlier discussed the sharing of <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> costs in the Congo and the question of the
                        U.S. share of those costs, it had been said that the Secretary-General would
                        include the costs in the regular <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> budget,
                        to which the U.S. contributes 30 per cent. Now, however, we were apparently
                        paying nearly half of the costs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> wondered whether we had any idea as to the success
                        the Secretary-General was likely to have in getting the costs put in the
                        regular <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> budget. In response Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that
                        Hammarskjold had had no time to give further consideration to this matter
                        since he had been fighting for his life, first against the Belgians and now
                        against <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. However, the U.S. was
                        not paying anything now. We had asked Congress for $100 million for the
                        contingency fund as a sort of round figure. The best estimate was that total
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> costs in the Congo for the year would
                        be about $200 million, but there was no agreement that the U.S. would pay
                        half of these costs. If we got the $100 million we had asked for, this would
                        give us funds which could be used elsewhere in Africa if they were not
                        required in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> stated that recent
                        developments in the Congo had raised two interesting questions relating to
                        the World Bank. At the time the Congo became independent, the World Bank had
                        a $140 million commitment to it of which one hundred million dollars had
                        been disbursed. The Belgians had guaranteed the loan and would be liable for
                        defaults. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had asked for the
                        other $40 million but the Bank had declined to disburse it until it knew
                        that the money would be used appropriately. The Bank had also pointed out
                        that a one million dollar repayment was due. The Congo had then promptly
                        made this repayment. There was an interesting question as to whether now,
                        with the change in sovereignty, Belgium would withdraw its guarantee of the
                        undisbursed $40 million. If it did, the Bank would not disburse this
                        balance, but if it did not, the Bank would disburse it at an appropriate
                        time. This sort of problem had never been presented to the Bank before.
                        Turning to the second question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> noted that another installment of the repayment of
                        the loan to the Congo was due before the Bank meeting in September. A
                        question might arise as to whether, if the Congo defaults on this repayment
                        and at the same time asks for membership in the Bank, it should be accepted
                        into membership. Both of these questions were rather novel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called on Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName>. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said that we were torn between the
                        problem of not inexhaustible U.S. resources and the need to keep the
                        Communists out of Africa. We could not do everything and people were hard to
                        get, but there was a sense of <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0184"
                        />urgency about the problem of eventual Communist infiltration. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> indicated that he was
                        disturbed by the policy of relying upon the European metropoles. He
                        recognized U.S. resource limitations but he doubted whether the Europeans
                        would continue to be welcome. Also they might not be very willing to
                        continue their assistance. The President said that he thought the whole
                        theory of the French Community was to keep the ex-colonies of France closely
                        bound to France economically and culturally. In talking with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> about French provision of
                        assistance to underdeveloped countries, <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had said that the French responsibility in this regard
                        was to the French Community. But <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> had also hinted that he expected the U.S. to help in
                        the French Community. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> asked
                        whether French ex-colonies would not be coming directly to the U.S. as they
                        become independent and whether we would not have to deal with each of them
                        individually. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed
                        that they would do this as a means of showing their independence.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> felt this was a most
                        important question of policy. Our present policy was unworkable, he said, if
                        it caused us to relax our sense of urgency; if it prevented imaginative,
                        urgent thinking and getting good people to lead a federal or collective
                        arrangement in Africa. He agreed, however, that we should rely as much as we
                        could on Europe; hopefully the Europeans would maintain their assistance.
                        The President indicated that in the case of the French Community, except for
                        Guinea, we should get the countries to go first to Paris. The President
                        indicated that when he had talked directly with the nine Prime Ministers of
                        the Community, this was their whole notion. Some of these Prime Ministers
                        were not even sure that they wanted independence except for the fact that it
                        would give them a vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. To every
                        one of them obtaining a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote was the most
                        important thing because it would demonstrate their lack of dependence on
                        France.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that one
                        result of Council consideration of Africa at this time had been fuller
                        agreement between State and Defense on the role of military assistance. A
                        year or two ago, he said, when there had been discussion of the use of
                        military aid for political as well as for military purposes, Defense had not
                        shown much interest in aid for political purposes. However, the <gloss
                            target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> comments on the present Discussion Paper
                        emphasized the importance of military assistance for political purposes.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then read from
                        Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views.<note

                        said that the problem was one of defending in Congress the provision of

                    <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0185"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called on Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> who noted that he had been interested
                        in Africa since 1948. He said that there were two matters that he wished to
                        discuss. One was the question of political boundaries; the other was the
                        economic aspects of anything that we undertake in Africa in relationship to
                        the massive dimensions of African problems. Turning first to the boundary
                        question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> noted that
                        existing boundaries in Africa were highly artificial, cutting across tribal
                        and racial divisions. This was true not only of national boundaries but also
                        of provincial boundaries. The six provinces into which the Congo was divided
                        gave no recognition to tribal lines. This situation, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said, foretells tremendous trouble in
                        Africa. Members of a tribe move back and forth across national and
                        provincial boundaries, raising questions of grazing and water rights,
                        administration of justice, etc. Where the U.S. has the opportunity to use
                        its influence on the boundary question, he felt that we should support
                        recognition of the historical tribal boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> whether
                        he would care to serve as a mediator on such a question with the Emperor of
                        Ethiopia. In response Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said
                        he recognized that the problem was not an easy one to deal with. He said
                        that the tribal situation was related to the kind of democracy that was
                        appropriate for these countries. The Africans do not understand
                        Western-style ballot box democracy. If the Congo were to be reorganized
                        politically, the reorganization should start on the basis of tribal lines.
                        Tribal federations like those formed by the American Indians would provide
                        the best basis for political organization. We could not assume that Africans
                        would accept our kind of democracy. Democracy in Africa did not extend
                        beyond the village; beyond the village the people look to the chief of the
                        tribe who is a kind of dictator. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                            >Stans</persName> said he had no solution to this problem but he felt
                        that we should recognize it in everything that we plan in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> suggested that it was
                        important to recognize the size of the economic problem. It was claimed that
                        per capita income in the Congo was $42 per year, but actual money income of
                        many Congolese was less than one dollar per year. To build any kind of a
                        viable economy would be a tremendous undertaking in most of these countries.
                        In this connection the time span involved was important. If the job had to
                        be done in a short time, it would cost much more than if it were done
                        gradually with a greater amount of self-generated financing. The people of
                        Africa now are impatient for economic growth and advancement. Their demands
                        were insatiable. Through the years, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                            >Stans</persName> said, anything that the blacks had got had come from
                        the whites and they are going to continue to look to the whites for
                        assistance. Anything diverted to military uses would accentuate the tribal
                        problem and the economic problem. This suggested that we should provide as
                        little military assistance as possible except for assistance to police <pb
                            n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0186"/>forces. The more these countries
                        could play the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> off against the West,
                        the higher would be the costs to us. This suggested that we should do almost
                        everything multilaterally. No country is going to be satisfied with what it
                        gets. It was sometimes tempting, therefore, to think of letting the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> handle the problem alone for say 25 years
                        because the Soviets could not possibly meet African demands. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> recognized that this was not
                        possible, but he expressed the view that direct competition with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not desirable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> suggested that we should do
                        some long-range thinking about what was really involved in building up the
                        economies of African countries. We should examine how much it would cost,
                        say, to build up the per capita income of a particular country to $500 per
                        year in ten to twenty-five years. Five hundred dollars per year would not
                        satisfy the Africans any more than $300 or $2000 would. We were talking, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> suggested, about so many
                        billions of dollars that to start with $100 million was illusory. If we knew
                        how much was involved, it would help us answer such questions as the extent
                        to which we relied upon a multilateral approach and whether we should
                        cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>’ last
                        observations, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                        that the U.S. could not consider any area of the world in a vacuum. We had
                        to relate it to our total resources and priorities. Our thinking was that,
                        so far as any major effort was concerned, black Africa should have a
                        relatively low priority. This did not mean that we should not make an effort
                        but rather that our efforts should be limited to technical assistance and
                        some individual projects like Volta Dams. Latin America, where U.S.
                        responsibility is greater and the possibility of success is also greater,
                        should have a higher priority. The same thing was true of India where the
                        prospects of success were also greater and where the country was willing to
                        contribute to its own development. We could not get ourselves into a
                        position where we were committed to vast contributions to Africa.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> suggested that modest
                        help in agriculture and education would have the greatest impact on the
                        people and that this was the best way in the long run to get at the problem
                        of aid to Africa. It was better than pouring money into the pockets of
                        people who could not handle it. In this connection, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> told the Council of his conversation
                        with a teacher of an elementary school in Africa who had asked if there was
                        not some way to get money for pencils and blackboards so that he could
                        really teach the children in his school rather than having them spend most
                        of their time singing and marching. As another illustration of the problem
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> told of how the Basonge
                        tribe in the Congo, having become conscious of a world larger than that of
                        the tribe itself, had discussed how the tribe might make economic progress.
                        As a result of this discussion, the tribe had established <pb n="157"
                            xml:id="pg_157" facs="0187"/>an improvement fund based upon a
                        one-dollar-per-year assessment of every member, with the thought that the
                        tribe would then seek advice from the U.S. or elsewhere as to what kinds of
                        things it could grow and what kind of things might have a market outside the
                        tribe. The idea was excellent in concept, but not being successful in
                        finding a way to use the funds collected, the chiefs of the tribe used them
                        to buy fourteen Ford cars.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that Secretary
                        Gates’ basic idea was the one that we had been following. In the
                        presentation to Congress for Fiscal Year 1961 we had asked for a special
                        fund for Africa which was intended primarily for educational facilities. In
                        Africa you could not run technical assistance on the same basis as in other
                        areas because people lacked the basic equipment which was necessary to make
                        the technical assistance work. Therefore, you had to provide them with basic
                        implements as an adjunct to the technical assistance program; this was the
                        purpose of the special fund. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said there would be some larger projects, mentioning
                        in particular the aluminum complex on the west coast of Africa, where it was
                        a question of either the U.S. doing it or the Soviets doing it. The
                        President said this was the difficulty behind everything we did—the Free
                        World-Soviet competition. He agreed that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        approach was best, although the Russians would not do their part and would
                        continue infiltration and similar activities. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that when a country becomes
                        independent, the first thing that happens is that a Soviet ship arrives and
                        we are “off to the races.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary Mueller<note n="12" xml:id="d33fn12">Frederick H. Mueller,
                            Secretary of Commerce.</note> stated that in Somalia, the only country
                        in Africa with which he was somewhat familiar, the <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                            >ICA</gloss> team was doing an outstanding job. It was providing
                        assistance in agriculture and drilling wells for irrigation. These were
                        simple and minor things but their objective was to quadruple the
                        agricultural surplus of Somali-land. The Somalis were very appreciative of
                        these programs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that information on U.S. human
                        resources was scattered in various departments, universities and
                        foundations. He suggested that a small group be established under State or
                        the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> to assess these resources. They were
                        shallow enough at best. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said this was exactly what he had meant. Secretary
                        Mueller said that this was what Commerce was attempting to get the Committee
                        of Economic Development to do; to determine what should be our
                        responsibility in Africa. (The subsequent discussion indicated that
                        Secretary Mueller was speaking of the Committee of Economic Development
                        study of prospects for U.S. investment and trade previously discussed in the
                        Planning Board.)</p>
                    <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0188"/>
                    <p>The discussion then turned to development of the bauxite deposits in Guinea.
                        In this connection Secretary Mueller pointed out that the cost of aluminum
                        is the cost of power and that the U.S. Government might have to provide some
                        sort of guarantee to the private group interested in aluminum development in
                        Africa on the matter of the cost of power. The cost of power obtained from
                        Ghana would be greater than the cost to Kaiser Aluminum of power obtained
                        from the Bonneville Dam. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> pointed out that this was because Ghana had to pay
                        six per cent interest to the World Bank on its loan while Bonneville had no
                        similar interest costs. Secretary Mueller said that we would have to give
                        these businessmen an even shake if we wanted to keep this great resource for
                        the Free World. He thought we should find some way to do it. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that we were
                        now in the midst of negotiations with Ghana and the consortium interested in
                        aluminum development and were close to agreement. Financing arrangements for
                        the Volta Dam would make the difference on power rates. The present plan was
                        to have Ghana provide $85 million of the funds required; the World Bank $40
                        million; and the U.S. $30 million. We have committed ourselves to the $30
                        million but the question of how we would divide this between the Development
                        Loan Fund and the Export-Import Bank would have a good deal of effect on
                        interest costs. If the whole loan were made by the Export-Import Bank at 5¾,
                        per cent interest, the cost of power would be so high that there would be no
                        development. We were presently thinking in terms of a $20 million, 3½ per
                        cent <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loan and a $10 million, 5¾ per cent
                        Export-Import Bank Loan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                            >Gates</persName> asked why this could not be done with venture money.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that
                        only the dam involved government financing; that private investors were
                        putting up the funds for bauxite development, smelters and port
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> suggested that in
                        talking with Ghana it was important to get a commitment to the aluminum
                        project of 70 per cent of the power produced. In response Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that the
                        problem at the moment was the other way around—Ghana wanted more than 70 per
                        cent committed to the aluminum project. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said that this was always the way
                        it was at the beginning of such a project but later Ghana would want all the
                        power itself. If we were going to put up much of the money for the project,
                        we ought to have a lot to say about how the power is to be distributed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> indicated that the Planning
                        Board would take another look at the two policy papers to see whether they
                        needed to be revised. There appeared to be one difference of view within the
                        Council—on the question of providing arms to Africa. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> did not take the same position on
                        this question as did State and Defense. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that he agreed with Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName>’ view as to <pb n="159"
                            xml:id="pg_159" facs="0189"/>the appropriate policy up to the point when
                        the Soviets move in. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                            >Lemnitzer</persName> said that he agreed that it was desirable to
                        provide arms for internal security purposes only. We did not want to be in
                        an arms competition. The whole continent, he observed, was not ready for
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> agreed that independence had
                        come fifty years too soon. He suggested that the Planning Board should
                        consider Item 6 and the last part of Item 2 in the list of Planning Board
                        questions. He hoped we could develop a broad plan which would seek to
                        guarantee free elections in Africa. If the Communists should then take over
                        a country, free elections every four years would provide a means of throwing
                        them out. While the phrase “Monroe Doctrine” might not be the right way to
                        express it, we should develop a Free World position to prevent Communist
                        take-overs. He indicated that he would think some more about these questions
                        and talk to his Planning Board representative about them prior to the
                        Planning Board discussion.<note n="13" xml:id="d33fn13">On August 29, the

                        Session in 1961. In his welcoming remarks to the heads of the delegations of
                        15 new African states and Cyprus at the White House on October 14, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> stated that his

                        All I was trying to point out was the kind of thing that the United States

                    <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are concerned about the threat to the security
                        of the United States which has resulted from Sino-Soviet Bloc accelerated
                        penetration of Ghana and Guinea during the past year and a half.</p>
                    <p>2. Bloc technical assistance and aid programs, designed to exploit the
                        difficulties, desires and prejudices of these two struggling nations, have
                        given the Bloc considerable influence in their internal affairs. Both
                        nations have authoritarian governments under the leadership of strong
                        personalities who are ambitious for a position of predominance on the
                        African continent, who have Western education and background but with strong
                        Marxist tendencies, and who admire the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        as a nation which has grown in national power under a socialist system.
                        Thus, both nations, but Guinea in particular, are increasingly following the
                        path leading to domination by international communism. Indications are that
                        Guinea is well on the way to becoming a Bloc satellite. Although Ghana at
                        present maintains a Western orientation, the sharp rise in Bloc activity has
                        serious future implications.</p>
                    <p>3. The political orientation of Ghana and Guinea is of significant strategic
                        importance to the United States because of their location on the western
                        bulge of Africa with coastlines on the South Atlantic. The air and maritime
                        facilities of these two nations, both actual and potential, would constitute
                        a serious threat to U.S. interests in the South Atlantic and in South
                        America, as well as in Africa itself, if they were to fall under the
                        political influence of the Sino-Soviet Bloc.</p>
                    <p>4. Since national regimes in Africa subject to domination of Sino-Soviet
                        imperialism would be unacceptable to U.S. national security, it is necessary
                        that action be initiated now to prevent the situations in Ghana and Guinea
                        from becoming a serious threat to the security of the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0192"/>
                    <p>5. U.S. military forces should participate in a coordinated
                        political-economic-psychological-military program designed to increase U.S.
                        influence and eliminate Sino-Soviet Bloc activities in the Ghana-Guinea
                        area, as well as in other African nations. Possible military activities
                        include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <p>a. Prompt establishment of military attachés.</p>
                    <p>b. Visits of U.S. military units, with the timing of the visits coordinated
                        with the political situation.</p>
                    <p>c. Invitations for military leaders to visit the United States.</p>
                    <p>d. Training of armed forces officers and technicians in U.S. Service schools,
                        coordinating with other Western powers if appropriate.</p>
                    <p>e. Participation of U.S. military medical personnel in local tropical
                        medicine research.</p>

                        Secretary of State with a view to initiating more active and comprehensive
                        U.S. interest in Ghana and Guinea as well as in other African nations

                        dollars. Said this decision based in part on findings of recent US survey
                        team and representations made by our Embassy Monrovia and by Padmore<note

                        to strengthen Liberian security forces. When President failed react to my
                        statement I invited comments or questions.</p>
                    <p>After some hesitation he launched into long history US-Liberian relations
                        interspersed with frequent illustrations of what he considered to be US
                        neglect of or at least lack of adequate attention to Liberia’s needs and
                        aspirations. He referred to Liberia’s entrance into First World War even
                        though defenseless at US request and Monrovia’s consequent subjection to
                        submarine attack; to <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank’s insistence
                        on accepting US bid on construction road despite 2.7 million lower bid by
                        Vianinni; to US insistence that Liberia pay back lend lease investments in
                        port and air field facilities even though Liberia pledged make them
                        available US forces in time war; to his personal humiliation at way
                        Department treated his Guinea arms request; etc. His main current grievance
                        however was “insulting statement” in report internal security survey team
                        which reflected “honor of Liberia” and very offensive to him and his
                        government.</p>
                    <p>His general theme was that although for more than hundred years Liberia had
                        looked to US as its mentor and protector; had in general followed US lead in
                        international affairs; had entrusted to US private enterprise development of
                        Liberian resources nevertheless US had not given Liberia assistance kind
                        needed enable it keep up with its neighbors which although colonies were
                        being developed culturally, economically, and militarily by their mother
                        countries. He deeply ashamed that Liberia after more than hundred years
                        freedom was now so far behind its neighbors. Particularly humiliating that
                        Liberia’s armed forces in such pitiful condition re discipline, equipment,
                        number, etc., he amazed at suggestions in survey report that Liberia needed
                        no militia; that Liberian frontier force could control frontier; that if
                        Liberia should be attacked from without it should depend on <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for protection. He stated any self-respecting
                        nation should have <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0194"/>armed forces
                        prepared to defend country; he was not making any exorbitant requests for
                        assistance in strengthening security forces; two brigades militia and one
                        brigade frontier force were his goal. This force to be built up gradually.
                        He not asking for such expensive and complicated weapons as jets or nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>I did not undertake reply to his specific complaints although with assistance
                            <persName corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> and Junkermann we did
                        attempt remove certain his suspicions and clarify various situations which
                        he apparently had failed understand.</p>
                    <p>I told him I had not been sent see him in Zurich merely to tell him of
                        decision to grant equipment for one battalion. My main purpose was to
                        discuss status US-Liberian relations. We had heard that he unhappy at what
                        he considered be our current attitude towards Liberia; we considered Liberia
                        as a loyal and trusted friend and ally; we respected him and had no doubt re
                        his basic friendliness to US. We therefore considered it important to
                        discuss with him our attitude re Liberia in broad perspective and learn in
                        some detail causes for his concern and unhappiness. I stated it our desire
                        see Liberia develop into a leader among African states. We therefore anxious
                        see Liberia surge ahead economically, culturally and socially and wanted to
                        help. If our advice and suggestions sometimes seemed gratuitous he should
                        bear in mind they were prompted by good intentions. We had however given
                        more than advice; we had been contributing to Liberian development and were
                        prepared continue do so. Recent decision equip battalion illustration our
                        interest in Liberian military needs. I agreed that if any nation was to be
                        self-respecting it should possess security forces prepared instantly to
                        fight in defense country. Not always necessary such forces be large in
                        size—but they should be adequately equipped, highly trained, and possess
                        good morale. The size of the military forces should of course be regulated
                        by economic strength of country. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be
                        depended upon to assist in case of large scale aggression. Colonel
                        Junkermann explained in more detail our ideas reequipping and training
                        battalion which would be based upon mutual agreement and tailored to
                        Liberia’s needs.</p>
                    <p>President gradually thawed—and conversation became more relaxed and cordial.
                        He registered his liking for and confidence in Ambassador Mathews and I
                        expressed our confidence in Padmore. He also discussed some his more
                        intimate problems and concerns re his own military people. In end he invited
                        us partake with him of refreshments which he had at hand.</p>
                    <p>As we took our leave he asked us express his appreciation President and
                        Secretary for sending us to see him. He said as result our discussion he
                        felt much better and more hopeful re US-Liberian relations. He also grateful
                        for decision equip and train battalion. He intimated, however, that
                        additional battalions would be necessary in due <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"
                            facs="0195"/>course. In addition to equipment and training for one
                        battalion which US offered on grant basis, he also stated would like to buy,
                        if found necessary, additional equipment for his military forces. I strongly
                        recommend that military aid program be implemented promptly and if possible
                        a token shipment of matériel be made available before end calendar year.</p>
                    <p>It is our considered belief that President’s unhappiness re status
                        US-Liberian relations not due merely personal pique. We think he really
                        worried at his own personal position in Liberia as long-standing advocate of
                        policy that Liberia support US internationally and at position Liberia among
                        “neutralist” African states as ally and friend US. We believe that he fears
                        that as rising tide of African nationalism makes impact on Liberia his
                        position will become progressively weakened unless he can demonstrate it
                        pays be ally of US. Similarly Liberia’s prestige among new African states
                        likely fade unless Liberia can show it also making progress. Such progress
                        not possible without vigorous US aid.</p>
                    <p>I venture suggest in view of growing Liberian sensitivity we be extremely
                        careful in phrasing our criticisms or suggestions; and that so far as
                        possible those which we feel we must make be presented orally and
                        informally.</p>

                    <p>DEAR JIM: The Secretary has referred to me your letter of October 31<note

                        Chiefs of Staff about the trend of events in Guinea and Ghana. I have noted
                        that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> has
                        recommended discussions between our Departments with a view to initiating
                        actions with respect to Guinea and Ghana and other African nations subject
                        to the threat of Sino-Soviet imperialism.</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0196"/>
                    <p>The judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that any national regimes on the
                        African continent subject to domination by the Sino-Soviet bloc would be
                        unacceptable to United States national security is shared by us and will
                        have an important bearing on the forthcoming reviews of our policies in
                        Africa by the National Security Council. I, too, feel that more must be done
                        to lessen the danger of Soviet encroachments in Africa, and we look forward
                        to discussing this problem in the context of the next <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review.</p>
                    <p>While we share the concern voiced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the problem
                        appears to be at the present time primarily a political one. Certainly the
                        situation is not encouraging, but we do not think that either Guinea or
                        Ghana are hopelessly unredeemable. Efforts to balance Western against
                        Eastern influence have in our judgment a chance of success in Guinea and a
                        very good chance in Ghana. We are pursuing policies designed to bring this
                        about.</p>
                    <p>It is our present judgment that despite an increasing drift in a
                        pro-Communist direction, manifested most recently by a succession of votes
                        in the United Nations where Communist and African nationalist and neutralist
                        interests seemed to coincide, the governments of Guinea and Ghana certainly
                        do not wish to be reduced to the status of Soviet satellites. The growing
                        influence of Communist advisers, particularly in Guinea, shows, however,
                        that a long-continued drift in the Communist direction could in the end
                        result in virtual Communist control. Our present policies are designed to
                        prevent such an outcome, and we have been heartened in this respect by the
                        recent successful culmination of our efforts to obtain signature of a
                        U.S.-Guinean agreement on technical assistance.</p>
                    <p>As for the specific actions in the military and politico-military fields
                        listed in General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s
                        memorandum, and other actions of a similar kind that may yet be proposed,
                        the Department will be happy to discuss these with appropriate military
                        authorities at any time.</p>

                    <p>The responses to the referenced circular instructions indicated that many
                        posts in Africa felt that some sort of arms limitation agreement for Africa
                        (or for West Africa only) might be feasible provided the initiative came
                        from the Africans themselves.</p>
                    <p>At the Conference of Independent African States in Addis Ababa in June 1960,
                        Secretary of State Grimes of Liberia stated that Africa needed to spend
                        whatever resources it had on development and “cannot afford the luxury of an
                        arms race.” He suggested that the African states should therefore do
                        whatever they could to settle disputes by peaceful means and that adequate

                        African countries maintain their security without wasteful and dangerous
                        competition in armaments. He added that he hoped “that the African states
                        (would) use existing or establish new regional machinery in order to avert
                        an arms race in this area.”</p>
                    <p>As a follow-up to this speech, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> has been
                        showing other delegations a draft resolution for illustrative purposes.
                        Section I of the resolution “calls upon all states to refrain from
                        generating disputes between the states of this area or from encouraging them
                        to wasteful and dangerous competition in armaments.” Section II “expresses
                        the hope that the new African states will consider carefully ways and means
                        to maintain their security without dangerous and wasteful competition <pb

                        examination of the possibilities of the establishment of regional agreements

                    <p>There has been little reaction so far to this aspect of the illustrative
                        resolution. The French Delegation stated it has serious concern about it, as
                        presently drafted, since it might preclude or be taken to be directed
                        against defense arrangements among members of the French community.

                        he “objected" to Section II of the resolution and pointed out that this
                        should apply to all states, not just to Africans. He indicated doubt that
                        such a subject should be included in a resolution on Africa.<note n="5"

                            >USUN</gloss> not to press for this part of the illustrative African
                        resolution in view of the importance of not giving the impression of

                    <p>Meanwhile, Ghana has announced its intention to submit a resolution embodying

                        keeping Africa free of nuclear weapons and military bases. No resolution has
                        yet been submitted to this effect during the disarmament discussions in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. The Upper Volta delegation has
                        indicated that Africans are now working on a resolution which requests all
                        states to abstain from nuclear or ballistic tests in Africa, from installing
                        bases for experimentation, from stockpiling or transporting nuclear arms;
                        and declaring Africa a neutral denuclearized zone. Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia,
                        Libya, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan and Tunisia have submitted a draft resolution
                        banning the use anywhere of atomic weapons,<note n="6" xml:id="d38fn6">For

                        there is no inspection provision and since its effect is to attack the
                        Western nuclear deterrent without condemning or stemming Communist
                        aggression through conventional armaments. These more recent proposals have
                        tended to distract attention from the President’s original proposal.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes that some initial simple arms limitation arrangement
                        might be desirable, at least as applied to West African nations. This might
                        be brought about by the African states acting on their own, possibly through
                        the Conference of Independent African States, without any <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        might, however, supply some supporting services; for example, a secretariat
                        for any formal or informal organization which might be set up.</p>
                    <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0199"/>
                    <p>A general agreement might be reached among the states concerned to hold the
                        level of their forces at approximately present levels or at levels raised
                        sufficiently to cover internal security, or the requirements of national
                        sovereignty or sensitivity. Such an arrangement, if it had the agreement of
                        the African countries concerned, might be respected by the potential
                        arms-supplying countries, including the former metropoles. The arrangement
                        would involve only conventional arms since this would simplify the task of
                        reaching an agreement.</p>
                    <p>The United States would hope that some sort of inspection system would be
                        adopted which would be effective under the circumstances of the region, and
                        which could at least begin to operate at the outset of the agreement. The
                        United States does not favor the establishment of a precedent for wholly
                        unverified arms limitation agreements.</p>
                    <p>The Department recognizes that it is neither possible nor desirable at this
                        time to project an agreement or arrangement in detail. Moreover, an overt
                        assumption of the initiative by the United States might defeat our purpose
                        since it would give the impression of too great an American interest. It is
                        therefore suggested that the matter not be discussed with the governments to
                        which you are accredited. The Department would, however, appreciate the
                        addressee Embassies’ views as to (1) whether any African government might be
                        willing to take the initiative toward an arrangement like that suggested
                        above; (2) whether anything useful might emerge from it; and (3) what would
                        be the best way of inducing such an initiative.</p>
                    <p>The Department points out that there are certain cautions with respect to the
                        above schemes which should be borne in mind. Among these are the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>Proposals for an atom-free zone in Africa might give rise to difficulties in
                        connection with U.S. bases in Morocco and Libya. Moreover, the United States
                        would strongly oppose any attempt to apply this precedent to certain other
                        regions of the world. In addition, related proposals re foreign bases in
                        Africa might create difficulties for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        and France. However, the implications of these matters have not yet been
                        fully explored and the Department has them under consideration.</p>
                    <p>Should discussion of the scheme become involved in African emotionalism in
                        regard to Algeria or French nuclear testing in the Sahara it might be
                        counter-productive.</p>
                    <p>Draft declarations banning, on a universal basis, the use of atomic weapons,
                        such as the Ethiopian proposal refered to above, should be avoided.</p>

                    <p>It has been suggested that Nigeria might be the most suitable country to
                        provide African initiative for the exploration of this possibility. However,
                        the behavior of the Nigerian delegation in the current General Assembly now
                        causes some doubt in this regard.<note n="7" xml:id="d38fn7">Nigeria had

                    <p>A “Special Report on the Sudan,” prepared by the Operations Coordinating
                        Board Working Group on the Near East, dated August 18, 1958, stated that in
                        a conversation on July 14 with Ambassador James S. Moose, Jr., and a later
                        conversation with the British representative in Khartoum, Sudanese Prime
                        Minister Abdullah Khalil asked what assistance he could count on from the
                        United States and the United Kingdom in the event of direct or indirect
                        Egyptian aggression against the Sudan. The report summarized discussions on
                        this subject with the British and recommended assuring Khalil that in case
                        of direct aggression, the United States and the United Kingdom would take
                        every feasible step through the United Nations to extend assistance.
                        Concerning indirect aggression, it recommended stressing the U.S. conviction
                        that effective action against subversion was best taken by the country
                        directly concerned. It also suggested possible steps to provide economic and
                        military aid contingent on the Prime Minister’s reaction and subsequent
                        Sudanese actions. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>

                    <p>Telegram 361 to Khartoum, September 18, instructed Ambassador Moose to
                        discuss Prime Minister Khalil’s request for assurances with him at the same
                        time that he informed him of a newly-approved U.S. aid program. The telegram
                        reads in part as follows:</p>
                    <p>“While stressing US conviction that most effective action against subversion
                        can best be taken by country directly concerned, you should point out that,
                        as <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> knows, US role in <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in defense of independence of sovereign
                        nations has been often and unmistakably demonstrated. US actions in Lebanon
                        and Jordan are clear evidence US does not intend ignore appeals of legally
                        constituted governments when independence and integrity of their nations are
                        seriously threatened by acts of indirect aggression. This connection, <gloss
                            target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>’s attention should be invited to
                        President’s speech before <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> August 13 in
                        which he said: “I would be less than candid if I did not tell you that the
                        US reserves, within the spirit of the Charter, the right to answer the
                        legitimate appeal of any nation, particularly small nations.”</p>
                    <p>“You should make clear to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and in
                        subsequent conversations with SAR and such others as may be considered
                        desirable, our continuing desire to assist Sudan in maintaining its
                        independence and thus moving forward as constructive force for peace and
                        stability in the area. You should point out, however, that practical US
                        support, in terms of economic, military, internal security and other
                        programs, in final analysis only justifiable if it in fact contributes to
                        determination of Sudan Government to protect its independence. We know
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> himself recognizes that, if
                        Sudan Government does not take action in this direction along lines of which
                        he himself best able judge, US support would then be meaningless and
                        ineffective.” (Department of State, Central Files, 745W.5/9–1858)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Moose reported in telegram 414 from Khartoum, September 24, that
                        when he met with Khalil on September 23, the Prime Minister expressed
                        satisfaction with the projected aid program and told Moose that he
                        considered the actions taken by the United States in Lebanon and Jordan in
                        recent months “as assurance of U.S. support.” He further stated that with
                        such assurances and with Sudan’s urgent financial needs met, he foresaw “no
                        difficulty” in maintaining Sudan’s independence and integrity. (<hi

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. The Horn of Africa, one of the most backward areas in the world, is
                        divided by ancient antagonisms, the most significant of which is that
                        between the Coptic Christians who constitute the essential national
                        component of the Ethiopian state and the Moslem populations which surround
                        them. Among the latter the most important are the Somali tribes inhabiting
                        the Ogaden province of Ethiopia as well as the three Somalilands (see Maps 2
                        and 3). (Paras. 8–10)</p>
                    <p>2. Ethiopia is ruled by the Christian Amharas (less than 15 percent of the
                        population). The old Emperor is authoritarian, but is endeavoring to
                        modernize the state through programs of gradual economic and political
                        development in spite of opposition from powerful ecclesiastical and feudal
                        elements. He has the internal situation reasonably <pb n="176"
                            xml:id="pg_176" facs="0206"/>well in hand. However, his death or
                        incapacitation is likely to precipitate a struggle for power at the center,
                        possibly complicated by secession movements in Eritrea and in outlying
                        provinces of the empire. (Paras. 13–30)</p>
                    <p>3. Somalia, the former Italian Somaliland, is scheduled to become an
                        independent state in 1960. The outlook for such a state is extremely
                        unpromising in view of the political inexperience of its people and the
                        inadequacies of its economy. The tenure of the Western-oriented leaders of
                        the Somali Youth League, who now control the government, is rendered
                        precarious by their dependence on Western economic aid, the possibilities
                        for intertribal conflict, and the challenge of the irredentist program of
                        the Greater Somalia League. (Paras. 32–36)</p>
                    <p>4. The French are likely to be able to retain effective control in French
                        Somaliland at least for the next few years, but the British position in
                        British Somaliland will be difficult to maintain after Somalia attains its
                        independence. The eventual union of that area with Somalia is likely. Such a
                        union would tend to undermine the Ethiopian position in the Ogaden. (Paras.
                        37–40)</p>
                    <p>5. The inherent conflict between Ethiopia and growing Pan-Somali nationalism
                        is intensified by virulent Egyptian propaganda directed toward subverting
                        the non-Amhara subjects of Ethiopia and toward inciting the Somalis against
                        the colonial powers and Ethiopia. Ethiopia, alarmed by the threat of hostile
                        Moslem encirclement and subversion, calls on the US for political and
                        military as well as economic support. Ethiopia is also making serious
                        efforts to develop support elsewhere in Africa. The Western Powers will find
                        it increasingly difficult to render aid to either Ethiopia or Somalia
                        without offending the other. (Paras. 41–44)</p>
                    <p>6. The Soviet role in the area is flexible and subtle. There is no
                        politically significant Communist party activity in the area. However, at
                        the governmental level the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, already
                        aiding the Yemen, has recently approached both Ethiopia and Somalia with
                        ostensibly disinterested offers of aid, in accord with its general
                        cultivation of Afro-Asian states. Its immediate objective is the promotion
                        of neutralism. (Para. 43)</p>
                    <p>7. The British are deeply concerned regarding the political trends and
                        prospects in the Horn of Africa because of their interest in the
                        preservation of a strategic position in the region, including Aden and
                        Kenya. They apparently consider that this interest can best be served by a
                        coordinated Western policy of supporting and encouraging favorably disposed
                        elements in the Sudan and Somalia, leaving it to the United States to
                        prevent, through aid and reassurance, any Ethiopian reaction either toward
                        neutralism or toward aggression against Somalia. (Para. 45)</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To assess the situation in the Sudan resulting from the recent coup, and to
                        estimate the outlook for Sudanese internal stability and foreign
                        relations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. The group of senior military officers under General Ibrahim Abboud which
                        took over the Sudanese Government on 17 November will probably provide more
                        effective leadership than its predecessors. In general, the junta leans
                        toward conservatism in domestic affairs. It desires to avoid alignment with
                        any regional or great power bloc, and appears determined to preserve
                        Sudanese independence. (Paras. 5–11)</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0208"/>
                    <p>2. In the short run, at least, Abboud’s regime can probably maintain its
                        authority through its control of the army and through the support it now
                        enjoys from conservative political and religious leaders, particularly those
                        of the Umma Party and the powerful Ansar sect. In time, however, serious
                        opposition may develop. The regime will find it difficult to satisfy both
                        its conservative Umma/Ansar supporters and the pro-Nasser elements among the
                        junior army officers and in the National Union Party. To the extent that it
                        moves to placate one group, it is likely to antagonize the other. These
                        tensions could lead to splits within the junta which might eventually result
                        in the breakup of the Abboud government. (Paras. 15–21)</p>
                    <p>3. The new regime will probably make a sincere effort to improve relations
                        with Nasser. In particular, both governments are more likely to undertake
                        serious negotiations for an agreement on division of the Nile waters than
                        Prime Minister Khalil and Nasser were prepared to do. At the same time,
                        Abboud’s government will be jealous of Sudanese interests and unlikely to
                        let down its guard against the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. It will
                        probably continue Khalil’s policy of developing ties with other African
                        states. It is likely to pursue a policy of benevolent neutrality in Arab
                        affairs not directly affecting the Sudan and to avoid association with
                        Ethiopia or Israel in an anti-<gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> front.
                        (Paras. 12, 23–25)</p>
                    <p>4. The regime will seek to continue good relations with the West, though it
                        will almost certainly avoid the outspokenly pro-Western policies of Khalil.
                        It will press for substantial and continuing US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                            >UK</gloss> aid, while remaining sensitive about any conditions attached
                        to such assistance. At the same time, a gradual extension of Sudanese
                        relations with the Bloc appears almost certain, particularly through Bloc
                        barter deals for Sudanese cotton which the Sudan has trouble disposing of in
                        the West. The government will probably also be more receptive than previous
                        regimes to Soviet economic and technical aid offers. (Paras. 11, 26–29)</p>

                        action.</p>
                    <p>29. To strengthen Ethiopia’s orientation toward the West, continue to provide

                        effort to avoid a military build-up which would strain the Ethiopian
                        economy, lead to commitments for indefinite U.S. support, or to increased

                        exercise a moderating influence in such affairs.</p>
                    <p>31. a. Encourage the resolution of differences existing between Ethiopia and

                        Somaliland and Somalia and to act in such a way as to enhance the
                        possibility of closer Ethiopian-Somali political arrangements.</p>
                    <p>32. Encourage Italy to continue to exercise a major role in the maintenance
                        of Somalia’s stability and Free World orientation. Encourage Italy, the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and other friendly nations to provide
                        economic and technical aid, including budgetary and police assistance, to
                        assist Somali leaders favorable to the West to remain in power and to
                        maintain stability in areas under their control. Be prepared to supplement
                        these efforts by providing limited U.S. economic and technical assistance.
                        Encourage the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to provide technical
                        assistance and to exercise a stabilizing influence on Somalia’s internal
                        situation and on its relations with other countries.</p>
                    <p>33. Study alternative consolidations of countries and territories of the Horn
                        of Africa to determine which would best serve U.S. interest. In the
                        meantime:</p>
                    <p>a. Encourage Somali leaders to be moderate in advancing the concept of a
                        Greater Somaliland and, to the extent feasible, to consider as an ultimate
                        end closer relationships with Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>b. Be prepared to accept moves on the part of French Somaliland to join such
                        a Greater Somaliland, provided this is acceptable to the peoples concerned
                        and is not inconsistent with U.S. security interests.</p>

                        Africa. This was to point out that we are now finding ourselves in real
                        trouble with the Lion of Judah. On the proposition offered by the British of
                        joining British Somaliland with Somalia when the latter area became an
                        independent state in December 1960,<note n="4" xml:id="d45fn4">Reference is

                            self-government in British Somaliland and acceptance of eventual union
                            between the Italian Trust Territory of Somalia and British Somaliland

                        had ganged up against him with the former colonial powers, Britain and

                            John A. Bovey, Jr., on February 25, summarized this matter. (Department

                            opposed both the Lennox-Boyd statement and the abortive U.S. proposal,
                            although neither concerned French Somaliland.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President said that if the French still had the strength to hold French
                        Somaliland with the important port of Djibouti, he was inclined to doubt if
                        it was wise to ask them now to give up French Somaliland. That area could be
                        very advantageous to us all from a geo-political point of view as a means of
                        blocking Soviet access.</p>
                    <p>Agreeing with the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                            >Herter</persName> said that actually the U.S. had a greater interest in
                        the Horn of Africa from a geopolitical point of view than had been indicated
                        in the paper. In response to this statement Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                            >Gray</persName> called the attention of the Council to the many claims
                        on our resources which came from competing areas throughout the world. The
                        President said he thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName>’s
                        point was correct and that he was not quarreling with the point of view <pb
                            n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0213"/>expressed in <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5903 by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss> Planning Board. He would, however, hate to see the Red Sea
                        completely bottled up at both ends by people who might not necessarily be or
                        remain our friends. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName> then stated that he felt that the Council should
                        face up squarely to a significant national security issue which was
                        suggested by the present paper. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s view we were heading rapidly into a situation
                        where a lot of little, newly independent countries were coming into being
                        and would inevitably turn to the United States for support. All of these
                        little countries wanted to act like great big countries. This would mean
                        increased demands on the resources of the U.S. for assistance. He greatly
                        feared that sooner or later the bulk of financial support for Somaliland and
                        similar newly developing countries would be expected to come from the U.S.
                        He doubted very much, in turn, whether we could persist much longer in
                        letting the entire world believe that we can and will support all these
                        newly independent countries. This meant to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> that as the U.S. became more
                        reluctant to provide the desired assistance, these newly independent
                        countries would turn to the United Nations instead. On the other hand, if
                        the United States should get into development programs for such countries,
                        this would mean that of course the Soviets would likewise become involved.
                        The Soviets, of course, could afford to undertake kinds of trade and
                        contributions in their currency that the U.S. could not afford to make in
                        dollars. Furthermore, Soviet aid programs through the United Nations or
                        otherwise would result in an infiltration of Soviet agents in the guise of
                        technicians and engineers whose ultimate objectives would be to subvert the
                        government of the countries they were professing to aid. This being the
                        case, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> expressed
                        the opinion that the best recourse for the U.S. was to be found within the
                        framework of the World Bank. Accordingly we may have to go further than we
                        have thus far in increasing the resources of the World Bank so that the Bank
                        would constitute a source to which these small countries could turn in order
                        to foster their desired economic growth. The World Bank was a stable
                        institution and the Russians were not in it. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> believed this to be a very
                        fundamental point.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had never been in the area of the Somalilands and
                        inquired what kind of an area it was. Did Somalia consist of wild jungle?
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that most of
                        the Somaliland area was dry and desert. Some of it was pretty high in
                        elevation. The President then inquired whether the Somalia people were
                        primitive and aborigines. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied that a
                        great many of them certainly fell in that category. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> pointed out that in the course of his
                        own travels he had encountered Somali natives in Kenya who <pb n="184"
                            xml:id="pg_184" facs="0214"/>were probably much the same as their
                        brethren in the actual Somali areas. They were certainly primitive. On the
                        other hand, the Somali women were said to be the most beautiful in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>The President, citing his experience with primitive peoples in the
                        Philippines, expressed some wonder as to how the natives of Somalia could
                        expect to run an independent nation and why they were so possessed as to try
                        to do so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> confirmed
                        the President’s doubt as to the capability of the Somalis to organize and
                        administer a modern civilized state.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> called attention to
                        the support which President Nasser was giving to those Somalis who were
                        Moslem as opposed to the Ethiopians who were in many cases Christian. In
                        turn Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> called
                        attention to the great importance of the port of Djibouti which he described
                        as a place from which this whole area could be controlled. He added that he
                        would very much like to see U.S. and other private capital go into the
                        Somalilands. This might provide a way out of the dilemma we were
                        encountering with respect to allocating our assistance resources. Apropos of
                        a comment by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> that at
                        the present time the U.S. had only three or four destroyers based near the
                        general area, the President said he was certainly getting very weary of
                        watching the U.S. build bases which we were unable to abandon for fear the
                        Russians would presently take them over.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> expressed considerable
                        anxiety over the influence exerted in the Somalilands by Egyptian teachers
                        and others who exerted influences in the area inimical to the interests of
                        the U.S. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> thought that
                        a sustained effort should be made to bring to the U.S. young Somali natives
                        who had displayed a potentiality for leadership in the area. He stated that
                        such young leaders should be trained very carefully and at some length in
                        the U.S. and he said that this was perhaps the most important single thing
                        that the U.S. could do to advance its interests in the Horn of Africa
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> commented that the
                        suggestion made by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>
                        would apply equally well to other sections of the African Continent. The
                        President likewise expressed sympathy with the point of view advanced by
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the problem of nations about to become independent, Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> pointed out that the Planning
                        Board would begin next week to discuss a paper on this subject.<note n="6"

                    <p>At the 414th meeting of the National Security Council on July 23, Director of
                        Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                        discussed developments in Ethiopia during his briefing on significant world
                        developments. The relevant portion of the memorandum of discussion by S.
                        Everett Gleason, July 23, reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>“In the course of his visit to Moscow, the Emperor of Ethiopia has signed an
                        agreement for a loan of 100 million rubles. The loan was of the usual kind;
                        that is, on a barter basis with low interest rates. It is also said that the
                        Czechs are extending a line of credit to <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile
                            Selassie</persName> of twenty million dollars. To these agreements there
                        are rumors of secret protocols of whose content we know nothing. These moves
                        may, however, be the first major attempt of the Communist Bloc to penetrate
                        into the deeper parts of Africa. This could be extremely significant. It was
                        also possible that the Ethiopian Emperor is, in a quiet way, attempting to
                        blackmail the U.S. Some opposition to his agreements has already made itself
                        apparent in Addis Ababa but the opposition groups, who have approached us
                        with the idea of putting the Crown Prince on the throne, have very little
                        popular backing. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> warned that this was a
                        situation which must be followed very carefully by the U.S. because of its
                        obvious implications for Africa as a whole. One unconfirmed report has it
                        that <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> has ordered the
                        abrogation of the agreement which established the U.S. Base at Asmara. This,
                        if true, could be extremely serious.</p>

                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> underlined the great
                        importance to the Navy and to other U.S. Services of the Asmara Base.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> added that the Asmara
                        Base would assume even greater importance if we were to lose our bases in

                    <p>Mr. John Root, Deputy Director, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                            >John</persName> Beard of the Office of Northern African Affairs, were
                        present for the <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss> consideration of this
                        paper. Mr. Root opened the discussion with a brief résumé of the current
                        situation in Ethiopia with particular emphasis on anticipated Soviet moves
                        as a result of the acceptance by Ethiopia of a four hundred million ruble
                        loan. Mr. Root said the US assistance program to Ethiopia appeared to be
                        basically well conceived and executed and that the US did not plan to outbid
                        the Soviets but that we would move to block Soviet dominance over key
                        sectors in Ethiopia. The Chairman, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"

                        <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> (White House) alluded to

                        first application of that policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> (<gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                            >USIA</gloss>) spoke at some length of his belief that it may be in the
                        interest of the US to attempt to direct Soviet resources into foreign aid
                        projects since once the Soviets began they would be forced to continue
                        foreign aid or be confronted with the problems with which <pb n="187"
                            xml:id="pg_187" facs="0217"/>we are familiar. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> was concerned at the public relations
                        effect of the US posture opposing Soviet assistance to underdeveloped
                        countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> commented
                        that US countermoves to Soviet assistance to underdeveloped countries were
                        premised on our interest in preventing the Soviets from (1) infiltrating key
                        sectors and (2) bringing about undue dependency by, influencing the policies
                        of and eventually taking over the recipient countries. Mr.
                            <persName>Dulles</persName> (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>) said
                        it would be preferable for the underdeveloped nations to “take the apple but
                        not the snake”. Mr. Scribner (Treasury) opined that it was impossible for
                        the US to counter the Soviets everywhere, and he counseled that we not
                        undertake to resist Soviet efforts across the board. He said if the
                        Ethiopians wished to go along with Soviet Union’s aid proposals in spite of
                        all our assistance, then there was nothing more we could do. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that while he welcomed Treasury
                        support he was not advocating that the US wash its hands and get out in
                        those instances where underdeveloped nations accepted Soviet aid.</p>
                    <p>There followed a discussion of the specific problem in Ethiopia of the
                        recently-made Soviet offer to furnish Ethiopia with its petroleum
                        requirements. Mr. Scribner said that “pouring US money in an attempt at
                        preemption was not the solution.” In closing the discussion, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he wished to make two
                        comments. One was that the State Department had the duty to protect US
                        private as well as public interests abroad; and, two, that expenditures by
                        the US to meet critical problems had by no means all been in vain and that
                        frequently they had resulted in substantial and impressive successes for US
                        interests. Mr. Scribner asked that the Board continue to follow the problem
                        closely. The Plan was approved for implementation by the appropriate
                        agencies.</p>

                        been bothered by problems involving Somalia. Italy would try impede Greater

                    <p>To assess the outlook in Ethiopia, Somalia, and British and French Somaliland
                        over the next few years, with particular reference to the Soviet-Ethiopian

                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. Over the next few years the Horn of Africa is likely to be an area of
                        considerable tension and international maneuvering, with Bloc and <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> influences competing with those of the
                        various interested Western powers, including the US. (Para. 12)</p>
                    <p>2. The emergence on 1 July 1960 of an independent Somalia, comprising both
                        the present <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trust territory and British
                        Somaliland, will add to the international scene an extremely weak and
                        impoverished country. The outlook for political stability is unfavorable.
                        Moreover, Somalia’s extreme poverty will necessitate continuing external
                        subsidies of the order of at least $10–14 million a year for the foreseeable
                        future. Although the Somalis probably continue to look to Western and <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> sources for their basic requirements, they
                        will probably be receptive to Bloc offers as well. (Paras. 30–35)</p>
                    <p>3. We see no present threat to the Emperor’s authority in the backward feudal
                        state of Ethiopia. However, the death or incapacitation of the 68-year-old
                        monarch would probably lead to a struggle for power, since the Crown Prince
                        commands little respect. Any struggle for power might encourage secessionist
                        movements in Eritrea, the Ogaden, or other outlying provinces. (Paras.
                        13–15)</p>
                    <p>4. The Emperor’s acceptance of substantial development credits from the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Czechoslovakia marks a
                        significant shift toward neutralism. We do not believe that acceptance of
                        such aid will result in early Bloc domination of Ethiopia, but it is likely
                        to result in increased Bloc influence. (Paras. 17–22)</p>
                    <p>5. The creation of an independent and enlarged Somalia will almost certainly
                        exacerbate tensions between Ethiopia and the Somali nationalists over the
                        status of the roughly 350,000 Somali tribesmen now ruled by Ethiopia and the
                        several hundred thousand others who regularly seek water and forage in
                        Ethiopia in the course of their seasonal migrations. There are likely to be
                        recurrent border incidents and appeals by both sides for diplomatic support
                        from outside powers. The situation would become particularly acute in the
                        likely event that the Ethiopians carry out their threat to deny access to
                        wells and grazing areas in their territory. They might also take limited
                        military action into the territory of the new Somali state. (Paras.
                        23–29)</p>
                    <p>6. The developing situation in the Horn of Africa will provide the
                        Sino-Soviet Bloc with opportunities for expanding its presence and
                        developing its influence in the area at the expense of the West. However, at
                        least over the next few years it is unlikely that the Bloc will achieve a
                        dominant position. (Paras. 36–37)</p>
                    <p>7. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> will probably retain a special
                        position in Somalia, but it is unlikely to achieve a dominant position
                        there. (Para. 39)</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0221"/>
                    <p>8. Although various other powers will remain active in the area, the US will
                        remain the principal non-Bloc target of Ethiopian demands for support and
                        will probably come under similar pressure from Somalia. In this situation,
                        it will be confronted with the constant risk of offending one or both of the
                        interested parties. In any case, the US communications base in Eritrea is
                        increasingly likely to become an important pawn. (Paras. 38–41)</p>

                        of a $100 million Soviet credit, and (2) the changing situation in the Horn
                        resulting from the independence on July 1, 1960 of the Somali Republic (a
                        union of the former British Somaliland Protectorate and the former Italian

                            reason the Emperor’s wishes, especially in view of the less stable
                            situation in most of the rest of Africa. The importance of maintaining
                            an atmosphere in Ethiopia which would assure continued unimpaired use of
                            the key facilities at Kagnew was also remarked upon.</note>

                        presentation, it is unlikely that Ethiopian reaction can be accurately
                        assessed before early September and it would therefore seem reasonable to
                        commence the policy review in early October. By this time also the character

                    <p>To estimate the outlook for the Sudan over the next few years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>1. The present Sudanese regime—or something very like it—will probably remain
                        in power for the next few years. However, it will continue to be faced with:
                        (a) pressure from the proscribed political parties for a return to civilian
                        government; (b) an internal Communist potential which is likely to grow as
                        Soviet and Chinese Communist activities in the country expand; (c) possible
                        unrest in the South; and most importantly, (d) dissension and plotting
                        within the military services on which its power rests. At present there is
                        less external meddling in Sudanese politics than two years ago. We believe
                        this situation is likely to obtain for the next few years. It is possible,
                        however, that within the period of this estimate, the <gloss
                            target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, in particular, might make a more active
                        effort to influence internal events. (Paras. 5–14)</p>
                    <p>2. In the economic field, we believe that the Sudan’s present modest
                        prosperity will continue. However, no comprehensive plan for economic
                        development has yet been evolved and the country’s relative prosperity will
                        remain vulnerable to all dangers that face a one-crop economy. (Paras.
                        15–18)</p>
                    <p>3. The Sudanese Government’s chief foreign policy concerns are to maintain
                        its independence, to sell its cotton, and to get funds for economic
                        development. Except where its own particular interests are at stake, it will
                        tend to follow the lead of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the
                        Arab League on foreign issues. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        probably has more influence in the <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0224"
                        />Sudan than any other Western country. Sudanese relations with the US are
                        likely to remain friendly, though not intimate. Thus far the Sudan has taken
                        no assistance from the Bloc, but relations are likely to expand gradually.
                        Yugoslav influence is likely to grow. The Sudan will seek above all to avoid
                        becoming an active battleground between East and West. (Paras. 19,
                        21–26)</p>

                        instructions were prepared for the new Ambassador, Arthur L. Richards, which
                        authorized him to transmit our proposals for meeting the Emperor’s request,
                        to reveal our plans for economic assistance in Fiscal Year 1961 and to
                        reaffirm our opposition to threats to Ethiopian territorial integrity. The
                        cost of the additional military assistance was estimated at $5 million in
                        Fiscal Year 1961. The Ambassador was also instructed to seek agreement in

                            xml:id="pg_196" facs="0226"/>thanked the President and remarked that
                        sending troops in defense of collective security is a long-standing policy
                        of Ethiopia. He pointed out the action of Ethiopian troops in Korea, as well
                        as the Congo. He promised to transmit the President’s good wishes, and gave
                        those of Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The President said he had tried to make a conciliatory speech to open the

                        cold war might be kept out of Africa. He said he thinks the consortium of
                        African nations, which would permit a lightening of the arms burden on all
                        its member nations and develop a sense of solidarity among those nations,
                        would be extremely beneficial, particularly in preventing domination by big
                        powers. Mr. Aklilou said his government had appreciated the President’s
                        speech in the General Assembly very much. Important business faces this
                        General Assembly. The speech had been cast at a high level, as befits that
                        body. Ethiopia regrets others have not done the same.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of an unrelated matter.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aklilou then said he has two or three points of bilateral business which
                        he would like to report and hopes, of course, that we always work together.
                        These are:</p>
                    <p>(1) He wished to thank the President for the military and economic help which
                        we have given to Ethiopia and also for our provision of emergency grain.</p>
                    <p>(2) Negotiations for a university to be located in Addis Ababa are going
                        slowly. The estimated cost of the university would be some $10 million. It
                        would be desirable to speed up these negotiations since they have been under
                        way since 1954.</p>
                    <p>(3) Ethiopia and the U.S. have agreed in principle on the provision of a
                        Fourth Infantry Division for that country. Implementation, (4) <persName

                        establish these people on farms and cooperatives. The cost here would be
                        some 15 million Ethiopian dollars. He hopes this can be provided under the
                        heading of military support in order to put these people on the farm. It is
                        most difficult for Ethiopia to establish a standard military retirement.</p>
                    <p>The President said that this last point regarding military retirement is a
                        new one to him. He acknowledged knowing of the Fourth Infantry Division,
                        recognizing that some sectors may need additional protection. He reminded
                        Mr. Aklilou of our requirements that any <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                        >MAP</gloss>-supported forces be used for nonaggressive purposes. Mr.
                        Aklilou agreed quickly.</p>
                    <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0227"/>
                    <p>The President expressed great interest in the idea of the university. He
                        feels strongly regarding the need for Africa to develop its own leaders at
                        home. Human understanding is our greatest hope. He reiterated that the idea
                        of a university intrigued him. The President said he is not too much on
                        building of armaments. He feels the U.S. itself has too many although he
                        cannot prove this thesis to his soldiers. The retirement project will pose
                        many difficult problems. The President promised, however, that we will study
                        this proposal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aklilou thanked the President for his sympathetic audience. After further
                        amenities, the meeting adjourned.</p>

                        contributes to the security of Western sea and air communications and offers

                        backwardness. The two principal political elements in this situation are:
                        (a) the Ethiopian Empire (with its federated territory of Eritrea) with a
                        population of about 18 million divided between Christian highland farmers
                        and Moslem nomads in the lowland, and in which only the barest beginnings
                        have been made toward national unity; (b) the Somali people, who are divided
                        between the newly independent Somali Republic (population 2 million), French
                        Somaliland (25 thousand Somalis, 40 thousand others), southeast Ethiopia
                        (350 thousand Somalis) and Kenya (60 thousand Somalis). The conflicting aims
                        and aspirations of Ethiopia and the Somalis are a major source of tension
                        jeopardizing prospects for peaceful and orderly progress in the entire
                        area.</p>
                    <p>3. One of Ethiopia’s main objectives, since World War II, has been to ensure
                        that the adjoining Red Sea or Indian Ocean coasts do not become bases for a
                        future attack upon Ethiopia. It has, therefore, sought to acquire control of
                        these regions and in 1952 succeeded through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> in obtaining the incorporation of Eritrea as a federated
                        territory. Since that time the autonomy of Eritrea has been gradually
                        reduced. The growth of Nasser’s influence and the resulting enhancement of
                        the threat of hostile Moslem encirclements led the Emperor of Ethiopia in
                        1956 to suggest publicly, but without success, federation of the Somalilands
                        with Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>4. The development of national consciousness among the Somalis has been
                        accompanied by demands for independence and political unification through
                        the creation of a Greater Somaliland, uniting all the Somali people in one
                        independent country. These aspirations have been partly achieved with the
                        independence of former British Somaliland on June 26, 1960, and its
                        subsequent union with the former Trust Territory of Somaliland when the
                        latter became independent on July 1, 1960. The constitution of the new
                        Somali Republic contains the proviso that the union of the Somali peoples is
                        to be promoted by legal and peaceful means, as well as a repudiation of war
                        as a means of <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0231"/>solving international
                        disputes. Nevertheless, the Somali drive for unification, in considerable
                        part at the expense of Ethiopia, constitutes an intrinsic threat to
                        Ethiopia’s security and territorial integrity.<note n="9" xml:id="d55fn9"
                            >The Greater Somaliland concept envisages incorporation into the Somali
                            Republic of approximately one-fourth of Ethiopia (which includes a
                            grazing area the use of which is vital to the pastoral economy of the
                            Somali Republic); French Somaliland (which controls the Addis
                            Ababa—Djibouti railroad); and a small part of Kenya. [Footnote in the

                        aims by force is advocated by Somali extremists, Ethiopian fears are aroused
                        and Ethiopian antagonism toward the Somalis is increased. For their part,
                        the Somalis interpret earlier Ethiopian suggestions for federation as
                        evidence of an Ethiopian plan to subjugate them, if necessary by force of
                        arms, including those furnished by the United States under its Mutual
                        Defense Assistance agreement with Ethiopia. The periodic use of force by the
                        Ethiopians to maintain order in areas occupied by their Somali subjects as
                        well as the restrictions on nomadic Somalis penetrating Ethiopian territory
                        from the Somali Republic tend to confirm the Somalis in their fears.</p>
                    <p>5. Ethiopian and Somali leaders lend lip service to the fact that the
                        long-term interests of the countries in the Horn of Africa would be advanced
                        by an accommodation between the Ethiopians and the Somalis. However, the
                        terms upon which each side proposes such an accommodation are not acceptable
                        to the other and have increased the antagonism and suspicion between them.
                        It is open to serious question whether the Ethiopian suggestion for
                        federation, which would increase Ethiopia’s internal difficulties through
                        the accession of a very large additional Moslem element, would contribute to
                        area stability. On the other hand, the Somali aspiration for a Greater
                        Somaliland, if realized, would extend, through the acquisition of large
                        increments of territory and population without corresponding gains in
                        economic resources, the grave political and economic difficulties of a
                        non-viable Somali State scarcely past the embryonic stage. Under these
                        circumstances, the United States and other Western nations interested in the
                        area have made little progress in their direct efforts to lessen tensions
                        between Ethiopia and the Somali Republic, but hope for some success in
                        encouraging both Ethiopia and the Somali Republic to look to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a source of their security. However,
                        neither of the protagonists has been willing to accept a U.S. position of
                        neutrality in this dispute.</p>
                    <p>6. In addition to the threat posed by the conflict between Ethiopia and the
                        Somalis, and the marked reduction in direct Western influence in the Somali
                        Republic, there is a threat to the peace and stability of the area stemming
                        from efforts of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Chinese Communists to exploit
                        existing antagonisms and weaknesses in order to undermine the Western
                        position in the Horn of Africa and to <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202"
                            facs="0232"/>expand their influence. In exploiting the Ethiopian-Somali
                        conflict it is possible that the Chinese Communists will give priority to
                        activities in the Somali Republic (either in cooperation with or in
                        competition with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>), in view of the
                        existing Soviet emphasis on activities in Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>7. Of great concern to Ethiopia is the extension of <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> influence to Northeast Africa. <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> propaganda and subversive activity among the Moslems in the
                        area and limited <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> support of Somali
                        extremists as well as the likely increase of <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> influence in the Somali Republic are all regarded by
                        Ethiopia as a danger. In fact, however, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>’s support of Somali expansionism will probably continue to
                        be moderated by a desire to avoid too direct a challenge to Ethiopia, at
                        least so long as <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>
                        remains in power, as well as by the relatively low priority of the Horn as a
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> target.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ethiopia</p>
                    <p>8. Ethiopia occupies a commanding position in the Horn of Africa and is the
                        only economically viable country in the area. Although internal stability
                        has been achieved under the authoritarian rule of the Emperor, the feudal
                        nature of the government, the fact that the central government does not
                        exercise effective administrative control over outlying areas, the presence
                        of a large Moslem minority susceptible to <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss> and other blandishments and still-extant discontent in
                        Eritrea are serious fundamental weaknesses. The Ethiopian Government has
                        been following a policy of military modernization, economic development of
                        the country’s resources, and almost imperceptibly gradual political
                        advancement. Economic stability has been maintained through careful use of
                        internal resources, the long-term expansion of export revenues, and the
                        availability of external financing. The long-range consequences of the
                        attempted coup of December 1960 cannot as yet be predicted. It is unlikely,
                        however, that the Emperor can, even if he wishes, accelerate appreciably the
                        political advancement and economic development of Ethiopia with the human
                        and economic resources available without resorting to forced mobilization of
                        manpower and capital. The situation will probably be kept under control so
                        long as <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> reigns, but
                        his death or incapacitation is likely to precipitate a struggle for power at
                        the center, possibly complicated by secession movements, especially in
                        Eritrea and the Somali-inhabited areas. Crown Prince Asia Wossen has
                        suffered from the restraints placed on him by his father, and although
                        publicly exonerated from culpability in connection with the December, 1960
                        coup attempt, he may be quietly removed from the line of succession. If,
                        however, he remains the legally designated heir, he may be able to succeed
                        to the throne, if only as a symbol, especially should he be supported by the
                        Army.</p>

                    <p>9. There are no major difficulties between Ethiopia and its western neighbor,
                        the Sudan, and relations between the two states are cordial. However, in the
                        absence of an agreement on the use of the Nile’s waters, any developments on
                        the Nile River which might establish “beneficial use” rights for other
                        powers to the detriment of Ethiopia’s future use are a source of great
                        concern to Ethiopia and will continue to have an important bearing on its
                        relations not only with the Sudan and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, but also with any other country participating in such
                        projects through financial assistance or otherwise. The Ethiopian Government
                        relies heavily upon the formal assurance in this connection which it
                        received in 1956 from the United States Government “that no action in
                        derogation of Ethiopia’s legitimate rights should be taken without
                        Ethiopia’s consent.”<note n="10" xml:id="d55fn10">This assurance was
                            contained in a letter dated May 26, 1956, from the Under Secretary of
                            State to the Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs. [Footnote in the
                            source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>10. Following World War II Ethiopia adopted a policy of active cooperation
                        with the United States. In 1950, it supported the United Nations in Korea
                        and subsequently followed the U.S. position on many other major
                        international issues. In 1959, however, Emperor <persName corresp="#p_HSI1"
                            >Haile Selassie</persName> made a state visit to Moscow, accepted
                        long-term credits of $100 million from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and $10 million from Czechoslovakia, and embarked on a
                        more neutralist foreign policy. These moves were almost certainly stimulated
                        by the Emperor’s discontent with the United States and Western responses to
                        his demands for material aid and diplomatic support, particularly as related
                        to the Somali issue. The Emperor’s fear that the U.K., with U.S. assent, was
                        pushing for a “Greater Somalia” had become and remains an obsession
                        affecting Ethiopia’s attitude on all other matters. More recently,
                        difficulties and delays in the utilization of Soviet assistance (in part
                        reflecting, as with previously initiated Western aid programs, the
                        administrative and technical difficulties of doing business in Ethiopia), an
                        increase in the U.S. aid program and developments in the Congo (where
                        Ethiopian troops support the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action) have
                        all tended to disillusion Ethiopia with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. There are indications that the Emperor is pleased that
                        the drift away from the United States has been reduced. Nevertheless,
                        Ethiopian acceptance of the Soviet and Czech aid represents an advance in
                        the Bloc’s efforts to undermine Western influence and to expand its own
                        presence and prestige in Africa, provides a framework for further Bloc
                        overtures to Ethiopia itself, and affords greater opportunities for Bloc
                        subversion.</p>

                        extensive military establishment—defense expenditures constitute 20 percent
                        of budgetary allocations—is being partially offset by the U.S. Military
                        Assistance Program initiated in 1953.<note n="11" xml:id="d55fn11">U.S.

                        agriculture, education, health and surveys of natural resources. The balance
                        has been given as Defense Support or Special Assistance for economic

                        $2 million have been made in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960–1961,
                        mainly to provide lending capital for agricultural and industrial projects.
                        Further loans have been requested primarily for financing improvements in
                        airways and highways.</p>
                    <p>13. In spite of the expanded Soviet Bloc presence, the United States still
                        occupies a leading position in Ethiopia and remains able to exert
                        considerable influence on Ethiopia’s orientation. While the Emperor desires
                        to maintain a substantial Western presence in Ethiopia and to avoid heavy
                        involvement with the Bloc, his aspirations to play an important role in
                        African affairs will cause him to attempt to avoid antagonizing “neutrals”
                        and thus becoming isolated. An example of this attitude was the Ethiopian
                        voting record in the Fifteenth General Assembly (1960) where Ethiopia voted
                        with the Afro-Asians (and against the United States) on numerous

                    <p>14. As a result of the Emperor’s growing interest in the development of
                        Pan-African cooperation, Ethiopia has participated in Afro-Asian
                        Conferences, although with increasing caution in view of the attempts of the

                            >UAR</gloss> to use such conferences to achieve their own objectives.
                        The Emperor’s desire to exert a leading influence in Africa is tempered by
                        his fear of a rebuff, damaging to his prestige, from the newer, more
                        radical, African leaders. He has, for instance, openly supported the <gloss

                    <p>15. The independence of former British Somaliland on June 26, 1960, and its
                        union with the former Trust Territory of Somaliland when the latter became
                        independent on July 1, 1960, added to the international scene an extremely
                        weak and impoverished country <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0235"
                        />faced, in addition to the problems of resolving tribal rivalries, by major
                        administrative problems involved in combining two formerly separate
                        governmental mechanisms established by the British and the Italians.</p>
                    <p>16. Post independence developments have to date resulted in a readjustment of
                        internal political alignments and the installation of a government which has
                        advanced a program based on moderation in the political sphere and economic
                        austerity. Faced, however, with major economic and financial problems, the
                        Government is under great pressure to produce tangible improvements in the
                        domestic economic situation and also to obtain sizeable amounts of foreign
                        aid. Moreover, in spite of the official attitude of the Somali

                        actions against Somalis (whether Ethiopian subjects or not and whether
                        within Ethiopian territory or not) and the popular appeal of the Greater
                        Somalia issue are effectively exploited by opposition politicians and
                        anti-Western propagandists. The net result is a strong tendency toward a
                        politically neutralist position in international affairs and toward the
                        acceptance of economic assistance from both Western and Bloc sources.</p>
                    <p>17. Economically, the Somali Republic faces an extremely difficult period
                        that is expected to continue for some years to come. Lacking any known
                        deposits of petroleum or mineral resources, its future economic growth must
                        depend on economic development in the agricultural sector. Banana production
                        and local handicrafts are virtually the only sources of monetary income.
                        Improvements in agricultural methods and techniques could bring immediate
                        but modest gains in production, particularly in meats and hides and skins.
                        The recent completion of the Inter-River Economic Survey, conducted in the
                        area between the Giuba and Uebi Scebeli Rivers, has provided data which
                        indicate that over the long term economic growth could be obtained through
                        expanding agricultural production and introducing related processing
                        industries.</p>
                    <p>18. The present economy of the Somali Republic provides a very limited debt
                        servicing capacity and the opportunities for financing economic development
                        of the Republic through external private capital investments appear to be
                        very limited. Accordingly, continuing external subsidies will be required
                        for the foreseeable future both to meet ordinary budget deficits and to
                        finance the limited economic growth which seems feasible.</p>
                    <p>19. Although the new government has proclaimed policies of reform and
                        austerity, the requirements for external assistance in the period 1961–1965
                        have been estimated by the Somalis themselves, if somewhat generously, at
                        $150 million for economic development and <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206"
                            facs="0236"/>$50 million to meet deficits in the ordinary budget. These
                        amounts are not based on any rigorous analysis and are clearly beyond the
                        capability of the Somali Republic to absorb.<note n="13" xml:id="d55fn13"

                            will amount to $10–14 million annually for the foreseeable future.”

                    <p>20. Italy and the U.K. can be expected to continue to provide economic
                        support to the Somali Republic.</p>
                    <p>a. In the nine and one half years that it administered the former Trust
                        Territory, Italy in addition to providing an assured market for the Somali
                        crop contributed to it an average equivalent of about $10 million per year.
                        As indicated by its commitment to provide some budgetary aid and to assure a
                        continued banana market, Italy will probably continue a moderate level of
                        economic and technical assistance to the Republic for reasons of prestige
                        and to protect residual private interests.</p>
                    <p>b. The U.K. contributed the equivalent of $5 to $6 million annually to its
                        Protectorate. The British probably hope to retain some leverage for
                        countering Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> influence and have
                        promised an annual grant to the Somali Republic. However, they have little
                        hope of occupying a preponderant position in the new state and will probably
                        seek to induce Italy and especially the United States to assume more and
                        more of the burden of support.</p>
                    <p>c. The United States has programmed economic and technical assistance to the
                        area in recent years at an annual rate of $1–3 million for a total of $6.8
                        million through the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960. As early
                        as 1958, the United States gave the Somali Government an assurance that the
                        United States would continue its interest in the area’s economic future
                        after independence and would be willing to help, by supplementing the aid
                        provided by other Free World countries subject to the availability of
                        funds.</p>
                    <p>Other potential sources of economic support for the Somali Republic include
                        the European Common Market fund, from which the Republic is scheduled to
                        receive $5 million during the next five years; Free World financial
                        institutions (when the Republic joins them); the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Special Projects Fund; and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                            >UAR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and Communist
                        China.</p>
                    <p>21. Because of the concern of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for the
                        political and economic future of the Somali Republic and to provide a
                            “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence” to discourage adventures by
                        either the Somalis or the Ethiopians, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        Secretary General contemplates assigning a personal representative to
                        Mogadiscio. The Somali Government has requested that the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> provide, in addition, high-level experts in
                        the fields of economics, finance, public administration and law. Should this
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group function as hoped, it could make
                        a major contribution to the maintenance of stability in the area as well as
                        providing disinterested expert advice to <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207"
                            facs="0237"/>the Somalis on their internal problems. Such a group of
                        experts would be particularly welcome to the Somalis because of the general
                        lack of confidence in some of the Italian experts who occupied high
                        positions in the Somali civil service before, and to some extent since,
                        independence. It has been reported that the low caliber of a great many of
                        these experts has caused great dissatisfaction on the part of the Somalis
                        and has rendered it unlikely that they would agree to accept a corps of
                        permanent Italian advisors.</p>
                    <p>22. Relations between the Somali Republic and the United States are generally
                        good because of U.S. support for the Somali Republic’s independence, past
                        and prospective U.S. assistance, and Somali confidence that the United
                        States has no territorial or other ambitions in the area. However, in spite
                        of reiterated U.S. explanations and statements of support for the Somali
                        Republic’s independence, the close ties between the United States and
                        Ethiopia give rise to Somali apprehension that the United States tends to
                        favor Ethiopian designs on them, and through its military and economic
                        assistance is increasing Ethiopia’s capability to absorb the Somali Republic
                        by force of arms or otherwise. The U.K. and Italy have agreed between
                        themselves to provide assistance to the Somalis in the military field,
                        including a joint training mission if the Somalis should so request.<note
                            n="14" xml:id="d55fn14">The Somali armed forces consist of (1) the

                            formed by the transfer of the Police Mobile Force to the Army and by
                            recruitment. The stated Somali goal is an Army of 6,000 men. [Footnote
                            in the source text.]</note> The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has
                        also offered to assist with small arms and training. The United States has
                        informed both the Somalis and the Ethiopians that, while it will continue to
                        help the Somali police, it has no plans to aid the Somali Army. Because of
                        the strong interests of the U.K. and Italy in the area, the United States
                        has closely coordinated with both countries its own action in the Somali
                        Republic, and relies on them to exercise a restraining influence on Somali
                        desires for military expansion.</p>
                    <p>23. The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> has made assiduous efforts to
                        identify itself with Somali nationalist aspirations. It will probably retain
                        a special position in the Somali Republic by virtue of its historic rivalry
                        with Ethiopia, its appeal to religious ties, and its readiness to provide
                        some educational, cultural, military and economic assistance. In addition,
                        it will continue some covert meddling in Somali politics. However, most
                        Somali leaders are probably too concerned with the problems of their own
                        state and too much subject to the conflicting pull of Pan-Africanism for the
                        country to fall under preponderant Pan-Arab influence as represented by the
                            <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>24. Even before independence, Somali representatives had attended Pan-African
                        meetings and at the 1960 All-African Peoples Conference held in Tunis were
                        able to obtain a resolution supporting Greater Somalia. The Somalis are
                        anxious to be regarded as a full-fledged member of the emerging African Bloc
                        and hope to obtain African support for their claims against Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>25. Activity in the Somali Republic by the Sino-Soviet Bloc before
                        independence was held to a minimum by the U.K. and Italy. Commencing with
                        the independence ceremonies both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and Communist China have increased their efforts to gain a foothold. The
                        Chinese Communists appear to have made considerable headway with the
                        leadership of the opposition Great Somalia League. The Somalis have agreed
                        to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the <gloss

                        of any opportunities to establish a foothold in the Somali Republic,

                        aspirations for union is the eastern portion of Kenya’s northern Frontier
                        Province. Some efforts have been made by the Somali Republic to persuade the
                        British to cede this area prior to Kenya’s independence although the some
                        60,000 Somalis in Kenya have only recently shown any interest in this
                        question and are divided in their reaction. The British position has been
                        that the question of the secession of any part of Kenya is a matter to be
                        decided when independence arrives, by the British and Kenya governments, who
                        would consider the wishes of the inhabitants. Kenya African leaders do not
                        yet seem to have focused on the problem to any extent.</p>

                        considered by the French to be of strategic importance to them. Djibouti is

                    <p>(1) Accepting assistance from the Sino-Soviet Bloc in particularly sensitive
                        fields (such as the armed forces, internal security, communications and
                        education) of a kind which would be damaging to Ethiopia’s security.</p>

                        likely to create undue Ethiopian dependence on the Bloc.</p>
                    <p>(3) Extensive use of Bloc technicians.</p>
                    <p>c. To the ends specified in b above, be prepared in particular circumstances
                        to provide further U.S. technical, economic and military assistance if

                        only as a last resort.</p>

                        waters between Ethiopia and other riparian states and, above all, avoid U.S.
                        identification with the position of any riparian state.</p>

                            economic aid to the Ivory Coast in order to demonstrate that cooperation
                            with the West was fruitful; he emphasized the Communist threat to Africa
                            and affirmed his conviction that the trend of events in Guinea could be
                            reversed and other states prevented “from plunging to chaos as in
                            ex-Belgian Congo.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                        background on what we are doing in the Ivory Coast and the other three
                        states associated with it in the <hi rend="italic">Conseil de l’Entente</hi>

                    <p>One of our basic problems in this and other former French territories has
                        been the extreme reluctance of the French to let the United States or any
                        other country operate aid programs. Even in cases where independence has
                        been scheduled and sometimes after its achievement they have informed us
                        they will oppose any outside attempts to <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217"
                            facs="0247"/>enter the cultural field. Nonetheless, we have undertaken
                        to survey the four countries to see where United States aid could be most
                        effective. A representative of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> will be
                        in Abidjan this month to arrange for the three-man study team to spend
                        approximately a month in the Entente countries in late August and September.
                        We hope one member of this team may then remain in Abidjan to form the
                        nucleus of what we expect to become a full-scale <gloss target="#t_ICA1"

                        that several economic experts from the Entente states accompany the Prime
                        Minister to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly in

                        assurance he needs that the United States will extend sympathetic
                        understanding and material support to him personally and to the four
                        associated states. We hope thereby to strengthen one of the most staunchly
                        pro-Western African leaders and to permit him to continue his guiding
                        influence on the future not only of these states but of others in this

                    <p>Had several long talks with Houphouet-Boigny Prime Minister Ivory Coast. I
                        found him much the most experienced and pro-western of French African
                        leaders I have met. Now that Mali is broken up<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2"
                            >Senegal seceded from the Federation of Mali on August 20.</note> he is
                        working quietly to get Soudan to turn to Ivory Coast rather than Guinea. He
                        refuses to have any traffic with the east. He believes China is of even
                        greater danger to Africa than Russia because of her undeveloped areas. He
                        stated that today Commie strategy is to detach Africa from Europe and US and
                        everyone should recognize that aid is offered for this political objective.
                        He said that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> believes he had
                        “descended to earth to liberate the African masses” and is now making a
                        mistake in accepting Soviet aid particularly as it is not necessary for
                        Ghana as it has been for Sekou Toure. Although both have adopted policy of
                        “positive neutrality”, he believes he can have some tempering influence on
                        each of them now that he is independent of France. He left me after dinner
                        last Wednesday to go to border village to meet Sekou Toure and said he would
                        point out to him the danger of the game he is playing with east. He does not
                        think Sekou Toure is a Commie although some of his associates are. He does
                        not consider <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> a “lost soul” but
                        he depends too much on his left wing advisers. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName> has a “changeable personality” due largely to his
                        lack of education and experience.</p>
                    <p>Houphouet-Boigny hopes Nkrumah will exert “restraining influence” on
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. He intends to urge
                        Nkrumah to act and point out how dangerous a Commie Congo would be to
                        independent Africa. He expects to see <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName> himself after Ivory Coast is admitted to <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He considers Nigerian leaders “wise” and
                        will be factor for stability when they become independent.</p>
                    <p>In Accra <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> assured me
                        unequivocally that he will give his full support to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. This is of course a recent change in position. He expressed
                        concern over the dangerous possibility of Commie Congo to Africa. The Congo
                        he believes must be united but through negotiation in order to avoid civil
                        war. He thought he could help as an intermediary since Tshombe had already
                        appealed to him. Although he expressed suspicion of Soviet motives, he
                        maintains policy of “positive neutrality”. He expects to see Sekou Toure
                        soon and will try to influence him against too much dependence on east. He
                        intends to discuss possibility of joint Ghana and Guinea Central Bank.</p>
                    <p>He is counting on successful conclusion of Volta River negotiations. There is
                        utmost danger that western position would be irreparably damaged if
                        financing were permitted to fall through. The British whom I saw, including
                        General Alexander,<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">Major General H.T. Alexander,
                            Commander in Chief, Ghana forces.</note> expressed this fear but
                        believed <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would have strong
                        ties to the west if the Volta <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0251"
                        />project is consummated. General Alexander believes <persName
                            corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s change of heart on Congo is
                        sincere. Both British High Commissioner and French Ambassador consider
                        Russians have made spectacular gains in Ghana during last few months but
                        feel that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is beginning to
                        swing back.</p>
                    <p>I am struck by fact that principal opposition to government policies in each
                        of countries I have visited including Guinea comes from the left, either
                        within or outside the ruling party; also that situation is constantly
                        changing and will be much influenced by the effectiveness and flexibility of
                        our policies and programs.</p>

                        to democratic institutions and firm relations with west. He does not like
                        the terms non alignment or neutrality as he considers himself committed to
                        western ideals. “They are the same as those of Nigeria” he stated. He will
                        not however join any power bloc “as matter of routine.” He understands
                        dangers from Communism and is concerned by increasing Russian and Commie
                        influence in Congo. He is champing at the bit for independence and <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership in order to exert counter
                        influence in Congo. He has already selected strong Ambassador to send. As
                        the largest and strongest country in West Africa, he feels responsibility to
                        exert leadership towards stability in West African area. He is annoyed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> because of his personal
                        ambitions and therefore difficult to work with. He is also worried about
                        Russian influence in Ghana. He expressed certain sympathy for Sekou Toure
                        since French, British and US had turned our back on him. He believes he is
                        not lost if we can give him some help. He has confidence in
                        Houphouet-Boigny. He wants increased American aid and hopes <pb n="222"
                            xml:id="pg_222" facs="0252"/>fact that Nigeria has no communism threat
                        will not make this more difficult. He wants aid direct from US rather than
                        through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as he has confidence in America
                        and wants to develop close relations. He values also close British ties.
                        This same view was expressed by Akintola, Premier of Western region who said
                        that poverty and disease are greater threat than commie activity. They
                        consider aid in higher education first priority, then industrial
                        development, expansion of power, transportation, and private investment.
                        Ministers foresee movement from farms to cities as agricultural methods
                        improve. Therefore planning for jobs and housing is essential.</p>
                    <p>Although differences between three regions will cause some internal strains
                        in Nigeria, I feel more confident that West Africa can be held to west since
                        my visit here. I have tried to get some indication of order of magnitude of
                        aid desired over next five years but ministers decline to guess until plans
                        now under way are completed. One longrange project is considered important,
                        namely, upper Niger triple-purpose dam—power, navigation and
                        irrigation—roughly estimated to cost around 150 million dollars. They hope
                        steel mill will prove economically feasible to attract outside public and
                        private financing to utilize the brown iron and coal deposits. Also oil
                        refinery to process their increasing oil production. Otherwise they foresee
                        need largely for smaller consumer food processing industries for which they
                        want to interest foreign private capital.</p>
                    <p>I am impressed with value of potential leadership of Nigeria in West Africa
                        providing we give adequate helping hand under present friendly atmosphere
                        and favorable conditions.</p>
                    <p>I leave for Brazzaville and Leopoldville today. I will return via Paris for
                        engagement with DeGaulle on September 15. I have also been asked by Heath to
                        stop in London which I hope to do before going to Paris.</p>

                    <p>After amenities, the President congratulated Mr. Olympio on the recent
                        economic union of Togo and Dahomey. He mentioned the fruitlessness of big
                        armaments on which the U.S. spends $41 billion a year. He stressed the
                        mutual benefit of productive aid and trade and wished that military aid
                        could be reduced. Mr. Olympio said that West Africa is doing well but wants
                        to progress faster. He expressed admiration for the President’s guarantees
                        of the security of West African States in his speech of the day before. To
                        the President’s question, he said Togoland contains 52,000 square miles and
                        1.2 million people. Its highest elevation is a plateau 3000 to 5000 meters
                        high. The President said this would allow for pleasant resort areas since
                        high altitudes in the tropics usually afford very favorable climates.</p>
                    <p>The President asked about elementary schools in Togo and Mr. Olympio said
                        that the first secondary schools had been created in 1948. Togo has
                        primaries but they need more teachers for the training schools. Since 1948,
                        Togoland has developed some 40 secondary schools and now their educational
                        system is able to give a BS degree.</p>
                    <p>The President stressed the necessity for progress to fit into the readiness
                        of the country. He cited examples in Iran where we had sent tractors and
                        gang plows without the recipients knowing how to use them. As a result, they
                        fell to disuse and rusted. What we should have sent were steel plows and
                        mules. Mr. Olympio said that Togo was fortunate in that the Germans, between
                        1884 and 1918, began elementary technical schools, to include carpentry,
                        etc.</p>

                    <p>To the President’s question, Mr. Olympio said his regular speech to the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is not yet scheduled. He has spoken
                        once already on the occasion of the admission of Togo to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President said he hopes all Africans will speak with one voice and
                        support <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions in the Congo. Mr. Olympio
                        pointed out the complication of many bloody tribal wars which are going on
                        now. The solution to these problems presents a great opportunity for the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> should not be inhibited by fears of meddling in internal
                        affairs. The President pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> needs an invitation to go into a country. It requires a vote
                        of the General Assembly for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to send
                        forces into a country without an invitation. Mr. Olympio said the invitation
                        under which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> went into the Congo is now
                        in doubt.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed disapprobation of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>. He went on to stress his belief in regional
                        groupings within Africa, of which the Togo—Dahomey economic union is an
                        example. Mr. Olympio said this was an agreeable fact to him since his father
                        had been born in Dahomey.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed hope for Africa in the parallel between Africa and
                        Latin America. When the Spanish left this region, the former colonies broke
                        up into many small independent nations made up of Indians and Spaniards. For
                        many years they fought each other, but this condition is lessening. The
                        President hoped that Africa can avoid this transition period by means of
                        regional groupings.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Olympio said the situation is further complicated by the fact that some
                        territories speak French and some speak English. Mr. Olympio said the French
                        grouping of nations can generally work together, Guinea being the
                        outstanding exception. He would like to see Nigeria and Ghana, the
                        English-speaking nations, integrated somehow with the rest. Mr. Olympio said
                        that Togo was never a member of the French Community. By contrast, it was a
                        trust territory. However, it can work closely with members of the French
                        Community. The President said he would like to see national [<hi
                            rend="italic">regional?</hi>] groupings in the area without outside
                        domination.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Olympio then asked why the U.S. has one Ambassador to cover both Togo and
                        Cameroun. These two nations are far apart and when the Prime Minister
                        desires to send for an Ambassador, he sometimes has to wait for a long time.
                        The President promised to look into this question, and the Secretary
                        mentioned that Congress had been a little tight with their appropriations
                        for Embassies. The President said there would be no harm in a few of these
                        Ambassadors living in tents. It would have a salutary effect if our
                        Ambassadors would, in some of these regions, live in simple surroundings
                        rather than luxurious surroundings. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                            >Satterthwaite</persName> added by way of explanation for the
                        arrangement of Ambassadors the fact that Togo and Ghana were having <pb
                            n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0255"/>difficulties when the Ambassadorial
                        arrangements were made. It was not well to have an Ambassador to two
                        countries who are having difficulties. He trusted the matter was temporary.
                        Mr. Olympio seemed to find this highly amusing and laughed out loud. He said
                        that Togoland is no longer having much trouble with Ghana.</p>
                    <p>The President assured Mr. Olympio that any U.S. government will be honest in
                        its desire to listen sympathetically to the problems of Africa. He himself
                        will not be in his current position long, but any government will be ready
                        to contribute. He feels that aid should come through the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> since bilaterals encourage power politics and
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Olympio mentioned the special fund of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> and the President mentioned the name of Paul Hoffman<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">Managing Director of the U.N. Special Fund.</note>
                        who he described as one of our big men, anxious to push the special fund.
                        The President agreed this is an important matter. Mr. Olympio said this is a
                        great help to Togo since sometimes an African nation does not even know what
                        it needs. As an example, when goods are unloaded in the port, the
                        trans-shipment from freighter to barge is sometimes a difficult operation
                        for unskilled hands. Togo needs breakwaters, housing and roads. It has no
                        natural harbors. Roads are extremely important to Togo in order to get out
                        their coffee, cotton and cocoa. The President asked humorously that Togo
                        refrain from producing what the U.S. holds in excess. We produce too much
                        cotton and coffee, our cotton running to a surplus annually of 9 million
                        bales. Actually, our largest surpluses are in that commodity and in wheat.
                        Mr. Olympio said that cotton is little problem since France always asks for
                        more of it. Togo produces no wheat; corn provides their staple diet. Millet
                        is grown in the north.</p>
                    <p>At this time, Mr. Olympio presented an album of Togo stamps to the President
                        which had been prepared for each nation who was supposed to have
                        participated in the May Summit meetings.</p>

                                the President’s approval on September 20. The memorandum stated that
                                the situation was complicated by the fact that the Soudanese
                                Government claimed that the Mali Federation was still in existence.

                    <p>As a result of the party conference held in Bamako yesterday, the Soudanese
                        Government has decided to adopt the name of Republic of Mali and to withdraw
                        the powers previously granted to the Federation of Mali. By tacitly
                        admitting that the Federation no longer exists, the Soudanese have
                        facilitated our recognition of the two separate countries. Since your
                        previous recognition was extended to the Federation of Mali, it is now in
                        our interest to extend recognition to the Republic of Mali. Accordingly I
                        recommend that you authorize recognition of the Republic of Mali at the same
                        time as recognition is extended to the Republic of Senegal.</p>
                    <p>I also suggest that you respond to previous communications from President

                    <p>After amenities, the President said he was delighted to have the Prime
                        Minister here for this is the time when we have the greatest need for reason
                        and sound thinking. Never before in history have we seen happenings such as
                        the mass emergence of independent States in Africa. Capital investment on a
                        large scale is necessary in Africa, but education and technical aid are even
                        more important.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said he was highly honored to be here, and that it is a
                        privilege to meet the President, not only because of his high office, but
                        because of his personal standing in the world. In particular, he is held in
                        high esteem in Nigeria for his contribution in the winning of the last
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister continued that we live in a difficult world. Here the
                        small nations must look to the large ones to exercise patience. If the large
                        nations do not exercise patience, they can cause catastrophe. Nigeria,
                        fortunately, possesses a wealth of experience in governing itself in
                        comparison to other nations of Black Africa. The British, no matter what we
                        say about them, took great pains to train the Nigerians to administer
                        themselves. As for himself, the Prime Minister said he had had thirty years’
                        responsibility and had governed a district of 1½ million people before ever
                        becoming a Minister of the Nigerian government.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed the hope that out of the chaos of the moment may
                        come a better world. In this evolution the small nations can only offer
                        advice to the larger ones. He hopes that large nations recognize this advice
                        as much as possible, and he assured the President that he appreciates the
                        tremendous problems faced by the U.S.</p>
                    <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0259"/>
                    <p>He acknowledged that the U.S. cannot allow themselves to be run over by the
                        Soviets. He pleaded, however, for an easing of tensions; for these tensions
                        affect the small nations mentally as well as physically and cause them to
                        act accordingly. This is aggravated by the spectacle of conflict between
                        powerful nations being conducted every day in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed warm admiration for the U.S. He said that
                        whatever may be said of the U.S., she never fought an aggressive or
                        expansionist war. Therefore, the whole burden of representing the West and
                        standing up to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> falls on the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said the U.S. is in a different position from the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. A journalist here the other day asked
                        him to comment on the need to free all captive peoples from their colonial
                        masters. He had said yes, this is so, but this would include the Eastern
                        satellite nations held in bondage under the Russians.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the Prime Minister reiterated his happiness in meeting the
                        President. He invited the President to visit Nigeria now that they are an
                        independent country. Millions there would be glad to see him. The two
                        foreigners whom the Nigerians hold most dear are the President himself and
                        Sir Winston Churchill. The latter, unfortunately, will never be able to make
                        the trip.</p>
                    <p>The President expressed his pleasure at having his own name coupled with Sir
                        Winston’s. He said he thought there would be a good chance sometime next
                        year that he and his wife would take a trip. If this transpires, Central
                        Africa will be high on the list. Other regions would be Australia, New
                        Zealand and Indonesia. The President said he had pondered whether it would
                        be possible for him to come to the Prime Minister’s inauguration. With the
                        world situation as it is, he had regretfully to decline and sent in his
                        place his good friend Governor Rockefeller. He had thought this would be the
                        best way to see some of the small nations that the U.S. is interested in but
                        had had to give up the idea. He promised to try in the future.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the Prime Minister’s words on the small nations, the President
                        said he spoke the truth and spoke eloquently. He said the greatest
                        usefulness of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is to the small nations,
                        but it is useful also to the large ones since stability in the small nations
                        is necessary to us. Turmoil in small nations forces the large nations into
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the opportunity to make the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> work
                        must not be lost. He expressed agreement with the Prime Minister’s estimates
                        regarding their uncomfortable position when the large nations glare at each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>The President then said the U.S. is seeking today all practical measures to
                        implement disarmament and the cessation of production of atomic fuel. If
                        this can be commenced in a practical manner, things will be well. On our
                        part, we are willing to open our nation to inspection <pb n="230"
                            xml:id="pg_230" facs="0260"/>from without. The Soviets, however, are
                        unwilling to do the same. Apparently the Soviets are afraid for people to
                        enter their borders for fear those people will be repelled by what they see
                        or by their own influence to foment liberalism.</p>
                    <p>The problem, as the President sees it, is that everyone can make speeches.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> refers to himself as a
                        “peace-loving democracy,” at the same time threatening the use of force. In
                        this atmosphere, we cannot give way or we will invite more of the same. The
                        U.S. has the problem of convincing the world of its peaceful intentions.
                        Actually we would rather put our money in helping underdeveloped nations
                        than into the sterile “fire department” for which we are required to pay $50
                        billion annually. This, unfortunately, is not practical since we cannot
                        afford to look weak militarily, morally, or economically. Any man who
                        witnesses the dead of a battlefield becomes the world’s biggest practical
                        pacifist. Force is unacceptable as an instrument of policy; we must reach a
                        meeting of men’s minds. At this time Communists refuse to believe that
                        individuals have rights. They regard people as servants, a state which
                        reduces them, in effect, to intelligent mules.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister said that, although Nigeria achieved independence only one
                        week ago, they have had some experience with the Russians. He agreed that if
                        you give in to them you are through. He cited an incident in Lagos when a
                        delegation of Russians, including Malik, called on him at inauguration time
                        and insisted on opening an Embassy in Lagos immediately. He himself had
                        insisted on the submission of application in proper form. They had argued an
                        hour, at the end of which the Soviets left in a huff with a statement that
                        the Nigerians do not like them. He reiterated that if the U.S. gives in to
                        the Soviets the world will fall to pieces.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister referred to the situation among the smaller nations. They
                        are all in a great state of excitement over the prospects of independence.
                        Some are not ready. They have a need for financial and human help without
                        obligation. Guinea and Ghana have accepted help from the Soviets to the
                        extent that the Prime Minister believes they have developed obligations to
                        the Soviet bloc. Nigeria will not do this; but this fact does not reduce her
                        need for the help. Nigeria needs capital investment of a private nature.
                        This he would expect to come from the U.S., Britain, Germany, and to a
                        lesser degree, France. He had referred to this in his speech at the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and asked that placing Nigeria in a position
                        of obligation be avoided.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister referred to the visit of Averell Harriman recently, who,
                        he said, had come as the President’s representative. Harriman had expressed
                        the view that aid to Africa be through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                        >UN</gloss>, with bilaterals avoided. The President hastily informed the
                        Prime Minister, much to the latter’s surprise, that Mr. Harriman did not in
                        any <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0261"/>way represent the President.
                        The Prime Minister continued, however, that if Nigeria is stable, and if she
                        recognizes the danger inherent in becoming dependent on other nations, then
                        she should be allowed to receive bilateral aid. The President agreed with
                        this and said that aid to Africa through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> does not necessarily preclude bilaterals. He said we put
                        great interest and stock in Nigeria. In this he says he is not just talking;
                        we will be depending on Nigeria heavily. He said the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> Special Fund is particularly valuable for the type of
                        situation which has arisen in the Congo. Here this fund would be of
                        tremendous value for the development of rivers, dams, minerals and the like.
                        The Prime Minister interjected that Nigeria has a river project in the
                        offing. The President said he believes by and large it is better to handle
                        aid on a loan basis rather than grant. This requires the recipient to be
                        responsible, independent, and self-respecting. He recognizes grants are
                        some-times necessary, but that they connote some feeling of obligation.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister expressed the hope that Nigeria, as the largest and most
                        heavily populated of the Black African nations, can do much to help the
                        other nations if they are stable and progressive. Nigeria, however, has some
                        way to go. Her living standards are low and technical know-how is lacking.
                        However, Nigeria’s standing is high, as evidenced by the fact that the
                        French Community nations came to Nigeria in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> and gave <persName corresp="#p_BSAT1">Balewa</persName> the
                        mandate to speak for them.</p>
                    <p>The President said the immature nations figure that with enough money they
                        can grow overnight. He said you cannot make a tree grow overnight, no matter
                        how much water you pour on the seed. Stability is necessary to promote
                        growth. He cited the expense of modern weapons and the burden which it is
                        placing on Great Britain. By contrast, Germany, not permitted to re-arm to a
                        large degree since the war, has been growing at an unparalleled rate
                        economically.</p>
                    <p>Turning to a casual subject, the President asked as to the altitude of Lake
                        Chad. The Prime Minister said it is actually at a low altitude, even below
                        sea level. The highest mountains in Nigeria are 7000–9000 feet.</p>
                    <p>(The discussion of institutes for primary education then transpired, at which
                        time I was absent arranging for photographs.)</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister then very seriously asked the President his advice on the
                        way Nigeria should vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on the
                        seating of the Chinese Communists. Here is a nation of 650 million people
                        without representation. Whatever happens, the Soviets and Chinese Communists
                        will come to grips and conflict will result. Thus, the Prime Minister cannot
                        understand why the U.S. opposes admission of Red China to the UN. He
                        admitted that he himself is a layman and not too well informed. He derives
                        his opinions from the competition which he has been able to observe between
                        the Red Chinese and Russians in Africa. The President admitted this is an
                        extremely tough problem. Conditions <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0262"
                        />have changed, and there are signs that the Sino-Soviet axis is not so
                        strong as it was once upon a time. He pointed out the emotional bill of
                        particulars that the U.S. holds against the Communist Chinese, particularly
                        from their acts in the Korean war and from their holding of U.S. prisoners
                        illegally. He pointed out that Red China has been branded an aggressor by
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and this brand has not been removed.
                        The President cited the fact that the charter of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> insists that its members be peace-loving. He further cited
                        the condition of U.S. prisoners when returned from North Korea, in a
                        brainwashed condition. Two years ago the Chinese agreed to release some, but
                        this had not transpired. The President continued with his bill of goods to
                        mention the invasion of Viet-Nam by the North Chinese, plus the Chinese
                        insistence that regardless of the attitude of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, they intended to take Formosa by force. He reiterated that
                        the American people are emotional. They look at the list of actions, and
                        say, “The hell with that.” At a later date the Chinese Reds may be admitted,
                        but this is not the time.</p>
                    <p>To the Prime Minister’s question, the President said he had studied the idea
                        of two Chinas in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> a great deal. He
                        feels that to recognize Red China would destroy Chiang Kai-Shek, our ally of
                        long standing. There is no easy answer; the President realizes there are 650
                        million people involved and the government is operated without measurable
                        resistance. He recognized that <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster
                            Dulles</persName>, in a book dated 1956, had said that after a certain
                        length of time any nation of this sort would be automatically
                            recognized.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Reference is probably to

                    </p>
                    <p>The President said he is hard put to advise the Prime Minister on this issue.
                        He said that if Red China is admitted to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> on a precipitant action right now, this would constitute
                        such a repudiation of the U.S. that we would be in a hard fix indeed. He
                        himself has always avoided the word “never” regarding Red China. Once they
                        cease their aggressive intent, release our prisoners, and abandon their
                        professed intention of taking Formosa by force, then the way will be open.
                        The Prime Minister said that would provide a new situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> told the Prime Minister
                        that the Red Chinese have rejected any prospects of two Chinas in the <gloss

                        considerably. He admitted that he had been ignorant of this fact, plus the
                        fact that Red China was currently still branded an aggressor by the <gloss

                        to a minimum; he thought one attaché from any service “could cover a great

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the group had wanted
                        to talk with the President because of a new policy question that has arisen
                        concerning our aid to certain of the African states. We are at the point
                        where we should give consideration in policy terms to the question of aid
                        for Mali. This is the first time we have addressed the question of aid for
                        one of the new, ex-French states. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said the French interpose no objection to our giving
                        aid to Mali. Houphouet-Boigny strongly favors such aid as a means for
                        keeping Mali oriented to the West and associated with the Ivory Coast. If
                        similar aid were given on the basis of need to all of the newly independent
                        French states, the total would come to about $35 million. He added that the
                        French are continuing to give aid to Mali at the rate of about $10 million
                        per year. He stressed the importance of acting quickly if we are going to do
                        this to avoid the possibility of close ties developing between Mali and
                        Guinea. This aid would be in the form of commodities produced in the U.S.,
                        including cement and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> with the
                        counterpart funds thus generated being used to improve a transport route
                        through the Ivory Coast to Mali. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> recognized that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                            >Stans</persName> feels this kind of aid should be given through the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The difficulty is that the Russians
                        and Czechs are pressing to give aid which would tie Mali to Guinea. The
                        President asked whether our <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0267"/>giving
                        aid would result in an advantage to us in relation to the Russians and the
                        Czechs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that it
                        would, adding that the Mali authorities look to us as the leader of the
                        West. The hazard is that if we do not give aid, we will be closed out of the
                        area, as they have attempted to do in Guinea. The great danger of a
                        Mali—Guinea tie-up is that there would then be a route leading directly into
                        Algeria. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> commented that
                        this aid is very close to straight budgetary assistance since we are not
                        providing a single tangible product nor are we developing a specific
                        project. The President commented that in general he prefers the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approach, and would rather like to see a
                        temporary type of action until the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can be
                        brought in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> then voiced several
                        considerations which give him concern. He did not feel that the action is in
                        accord with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy since that policy
                        states that we would not do this until we see whether the Metropole or the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would carry the burden.<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d81fn1">The relevant <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> papers
                            were <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6001 (<ref target="#d22"

                                (<ref target="#d27">Document 27</ref>).</note> He said he would like
                        to see the proposal developed for further consideration. There are a number
                        of aspects that need very careful study. Also he would like to avoid a
                        precedent that would proliferate through all Africa. The President reverted
                        to the idea of working through the United Nations. <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> has as its purpose the carrying out
                        of pre-development surveys. He asked whether the World Bank and <gloss
                            target="#t_SUNFED1">SUNFED</gloss> have looked at Mali. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said they have not as yet. He agreed
                        that it is very important that they do this, but he pointed out that this
                        type of survey takes a long time—a year or more—by which time the situation
                        may have gone against us. The President said he thought the large number of
                        small countries in this area did not make good sense. He wondered whether
                        several of these could combine, such as Togo, Dahomey and Nigeria. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that Dahomey, Niger,
                        Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast are forming an entente, with
                        Houphouet-Boigny the leader. He thought that perhaps Togo may join a little
                        later.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> commented that he understood
                        the French to say that we should sell trucks to the government of Mali
                        rather than make a gift of them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> showed the President a message proposing a consortium
                        for the development of the transportation program. He said the Africans
                        complain that we study everything to death, and reiterated the need for
                        quick action. He said that PL 480 does not appear to be applicable in this
                        case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> suggested a shift of
                        emphasis toward technical training, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> noted that such activity would be the function of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President asked whether this aid
                        is simply a token to get the Mali Government on its feet and permit time for
                        the development of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that its purpose is
                        to start immediate action. The President commented <pb n="238"
                            xml:id="pg_238" facs="0268"/>that if this proposal is one for a year or
                        eighteen months, that would be fine. If we believe that, while a <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program is being organized, we should put $35
                        million into all of Black Africa, he thought this would be a good gamble. He
                        did not like the idea of putting up $2½ million now and perhaps another $3
                        million next month or in two months, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said he would like to see
                        this action, if taken, based upon a determination that the situation does
                        not fit the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> requirements, and does not
                        constitute a precedent. The President thought the important thing is to
                        determine what is the least to get the Mali authorities in the right frame
                        of mind. He went on to say that the whole area is a mishmash of chopped-up
                        geography. He would like to see emphasis continued on bringing the countries
                        together.</p>
                    <p>He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to work to develop
                        as a basis for the determination the fact that we can do the job in no other
                        way. He also said he wanted our Ambassadors instructed to see if they can
                        generate interest on the part of the Africans in going to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President said that he thinks some of
                        the Africans may be fearful that they will let the French Government “off
                        the hook” as regards assurances that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> has given that he will aid them, should they turn to
                        the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said that the State Department is planning that, when
                        the President’s proposal for aid to Africa comes up in the United Nations,
                        it will provide a basis for moving ahead.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like to see us, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, in placing the technical institutes in Africa, put them in
                        the more friendly countries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                            >Dillon</persName> said he would follow up on this suggestion. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> observed in this
                        connection that Houphouet-Boigny is emerging as the most able African
                        leader, very pro-Western in outlook, and that his country is a point of
                        strength in this area.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the assistance would be sent in kind, and was
                        assured that it would be. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                        asked whether the President approved going ahead on this basis, and the
                        President said that he did. A written determination is to be sent over
                            quickly.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">A memorandum of November 1 from

                            xml:id="d82fn1">Between October 19 and November 22, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName> visited Cameroun, the Central
                            African Republic, Chad, the Congo (Brazzaville), Dahomey, Gabon, Ghana,
                            Guinea, the Ivory Coast, the Malagasy Republic, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
                            Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Upper Volta. En route to Africa, he met
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1">William V.S.
                                Tubman</persName> of Liberia in Zurich; see <ref target="#d36"
                                >Document 36</ref>. He also passed through the Congo (Léopoldville)
                            on his way to the Malagasy Republic; see <ref target="#d270fn1">footnote
                                1, Document 270</ref>. Documentation on his trip, including
                            memoranda of conversations with leaders in the countries he visited, is
                            in Department of State, Central Files 110.13–HE and 120, but in some
                            cases under country numbers; for example, see <ref target="#d83fn2"
                                >footnote 2 below and Document 83</ref>.</note> After becoming
                        acquainted with problems faced by our skeleton or semi-skeleton staffs in
                        Bamako, Freetown and Abidjan, and after looking at situation Ouagadougou and
                        Niamey, I convinced no representation countries this area would be
                        preferable to merely token embassy. Strains on skeleton staffs have been
                        almost unbearable. These staffs deserve great credit for manner in which
                        they have established good relations with local governments, but manifestly
                        they cannot perform functions of modern embassy.</p>
                    <p>We must bear in mind that diplomatic missions in these areas no matter how
                        small, must bear heavy burdens in field of administration, communications,
                        et cetera. Housekeeping chores are usually more numerous and time consuming
                        than in countries with long-established institutions.</p>
                    <p>Unless embassy has personnel and facilities enable it maintain constant
                        exchange of communications with Washington and various other missions it
                        will be operating in vacuum filled only by outdated newspapers and
                        fragmentary broadcasts. In fast changing world situation Ambassador not kept
                        abreast of international developments and fully informed re US attitudes
                        toward such developments would be so severely handicapped that he would be
                        ineffective and his mission would be disappointing to local governments who
                        hope to obtain counsel from him. I therefore convinced we plan supply
                        embassies established this area with adequate staff and facilities.</p>
                    <p>Not necessary, I believe stress here that developments in some of these small
                        African states can influence trends in all of Africa and eventually affect
                        our own security and future. For this reason we are suggesting in certain
                        instances we move particularly fast and that we plan immediately make our
                        presence felt in every African country in which we would be welcome.</p>

                    <p>As result experiences obtained thus far on my trip I believe we shall find it
                        necessary eventually to establish embassies with resident ambassadors in
                        those newly independent countries which we have not yet visited.<note n="2"

                        trip which may be helpful in your talks with British:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Conseil de L’Entente</hi> under Houphouet’s leadership
                        is going concern, thoroughly pro-western and entitled to priority support
                        from the west. West in general and US in particular enjoy reservoir of
                        goodwill which should be exploited.</p>
                    <p>2. Slippage of Mali and Guinea can be stabilized and in case Mali reversed if
                        Modibo Keita can be strengthened. Anti-French feeling however is so strong
                        in both countries as to be totally irrational and, while they both want US
                        assistance, our potential influence is limited by our association with
                        French. Under circumstances, it might be well to encourage Houphouet in his
                        attempts reestablish his former close relationship with both Keita and
                        Toure.</p>
                    <p>Repeated to London.</p>
                    <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0271"/>
                    <p>3. Case of Ghana is more puzzling and probably more serious. Moderate
                        elements in <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> such as Adedemah<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d83fn2">Reference is apparently to Ghanaian Finance Minister
                            H.K. Gbedemah.</note> are depressed and disheartened with extremists now
                        having Nkrumah’s ear. I feel British are not taking sufficiently serious
                        view of situation or adequately using their still great prestige with
                            <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> to influence him on more
                        moderate course. It is discouraging to hear British officers commanding
                        Ghanaian troops advocating increasing Ghanaian armed forces to meet
                        “aggression” on part <hi rend="italic">entente</hi>. So long as <persName
                            corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is not directly attacking Great
                        Britain, British seem to be mistakenly complacent.</p>
                    <p>4. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> both should do something about
                        Liberia and Sierra Leone. We are often judged by appearances in areas where
                        we are thought to be responsible and still greater effort seems imperative.
                        Political leadership in both countries is old and younger elements are
                        restive. The tawdry towns of Monrovia and Freetown are not helpful in
                        showing US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> support for small African
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>5. Nigeria still looks good and best hope for west in West Africa. It cannot
                        however be taken for granted and will require best efforts both US and
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to become real force for moderate
                        African leadership.</p>
                    <p>6. One cannot tour West Africa without being impressed with extent French
                        effort in past in bringing material benefits western civilization to Africa
                        but at same time appalled at foolishness which allows situations such as
                        those in Guinea and Mali to arise. Some French in Senegal seem to be
                        behaving in manner to provoke similar situation there.</p>
                    <p>7. We have been a bit too cautious in past on question of American presence.
                        In most countries, Americans are welcome and presence large numbers of
                        Americans is encouraging to leaders of unviable new states who need visible
                        signs of US interest. Too much too fast would be preferable to too little
                        too late.</p>
                    <p>8. No matter what British and Americans might do in effort to keep former
                        French West Africa oriented toward west, we likely fail unless solution
                        Algerian problem can be reached in near future. Sympathy for Algerians
                        sincerely strong in Moslem states such as Mali and Niger. Guinea and
                        pro-Communist elements in other countries will not hesitate to use this
                        issue to break down entente and try build new African unity under banner of
                        neutrality but really oriented towards Moscow and Peking.</p>

                    <p>1198. From <persName corresp="#p_HLW1">Henderson</persName>. On basis
                        conversations Yaounde we convinced we should move more quickly and
                        affirmatively in meeting Cameroun requests U.S. assistance. Cameroun has
                        potentiality playing important role in orientation of Equatorial Africa but
                        this potentiality can be exploited only through prompt and sustained action
                        on our part. We believe Cameroun Government sincerely desires be in Western
                        camp but will find it difficult resist Afro-Asian pressure if remaining
                        associated with West means continued dependence for aid on France alone.</p>
                    <p>While we were in Yaounde, Franco-Camerounian economic agreements were signed.
                        On this occasion Prime Minister Assale made public statement to effect this
                        agreement would be followed by similar accords with U.S. and West Germany.
                        If his announcement turns out to be empty hope, his regime may be imperiled
                        unless it looks other directions for aid.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Barrows does not believe Camerounians want to expect any sort of
                        elaborate program. He thinks not more than four key projects not exceeding
                        total $5,000,000 would meet situation. Camerounians although independent for
                        nearly year have so far received no concrete evidence U.S. has any policy
                        towards them except let French look after them. Continuation what appears be
                        our present policy can lead to defeat of West in this politically strategic
                        country.</p>

                        we have visited thirteen African countries which were formerly under some
                        form French rule. In eleven of these countries (Mali and Guinea are
                        exceptions) French continue play important roles; French officials in
                        background and sometimes quite openly are giving guidance to constituted
                        governments, helping government officials prepare documents for them, and
                        frequently making decisions for them.</p>
                    <p>It is my impression that our decision to open or strengthen American
                        Embassies in these countries has met with various reactions by French
                        officialdom. In general I would say they regarded pending entrance of
                        Americans on scene with mixed feelings of uncertainty, trepidation and to an
                        extent relief. Uncertainty because they are not quite sure what attitude
                        American diplomats placed in their midst will be towards them; trepidation
                        because they have some concern lest American presence make their task
                        maintain stability and respect for French culture, judgment and executive
                        ability more difficult and relief because they are commencing to feel that
                        task keeping these new countries steady and friendly to West becoming too
                        much for them alone and they hope therefore that new American Embassies will
                        share their responsibilities on basis cooperation. They feel that in course
                        such cooperation Americans will give some heed their advice based on their
                        long experience.</p>
                    <p>In general we were treated not only with courtesy but also with cordiality
                        and real friendliness by French officials in most countries where they still
                        play a role. They went out of their way to help us and when opportunities
                        arose extended us warm hospitality. I thought, however, that behind their
                        friendliness and hospitality I could detect at times a note of cynicism and
                        puzzlement—as though they were thinking these American innocents have good
                        intentions but what will be their reaction when they suffer disillusionment
                        based on experience. There seemed also be some concern on their part lest
                        members of various African governments with whom we talked would obtain
                        impression that United States was preparing to give the new states so much
                        aid that they could afford to take more independent attitude towards France
                        on whom they are now dependent for economic <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244"
                            facs="0274"/>support. From words dropped here and there by French
                        officials with whom we talked, I further obtained impression that they would
                        welcome certain amount of American aid to these countries provided it would
                        be granted after consultation with French authorities and would be
                        supplementary rather than competitive with aid which France is giving.</p>
                    <p>As I have indicated in other telegrams my general conclusion is that if we do
                        not extend some kind of aid to most of these countries their governments
                        will be deeply disappointed; they are likely to feel that they must go
                        elsewhere for aid, even to the Communist bloc. Although most of the
                        responsible leaders these countries would like continue have Western
                        orientation, they not prepared do so if price that orientation would mean
                        that although technically independent they must remain completely dependent
                        upon France for their viability.</p>
                    <p>Time is an important factor in any aid programs which we may undertake in
                        these countries. I think we should move quickly but with delicacy and
                        caution and without fanfare and ostentation. We should discuss aid matters
                        frankly with French in order ascertain how we may best help without
                        offending France or encouraging France to try to transfer to our shoulders
                        portion or all of the burden which it is now carrying. On other hand we must
                        be careful lest governments of these new states obtain impression we still
                        look upon them as colonies or semi-colonies of France and therefore make no
                        moves to extend aid without obtaining permission from France.</p>

                    <p>Our Mali aid effort based calculation that by responding rapidly to what
                        Malians regard as crisis situation we can strengthen hand moderate elements

                    <p>Over longer term, we also hope moderate Mali foreign policy behavior

                        equilibrium in world affairs, but only so long as it remains truly
                        independent. If it vacillates, however, this vacillation could have a
                        decisive effect on the whole world.</p>
                    <p>With respect to cooperation, Prime Minister Dia said that the Senegalese had,
                        of course, more to hope from the United States than the United States from
                        Senegal and felt that a program of technical and economic assistance should
                        be developed. Not here and now of course, but his technical and financial
                        advisors would stay behind to follow up the economic and financial questions
                        with the appropriate American offices and would present concrete
                        proposals.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary assured Prime Minister Dia of the sympathy with which he and
                        President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> viewed these
                        problems, and of our desire to discuss concrete measures. He pointed out
                        that we sent an <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> representative to
                        Senegal before its independence and before sending such a representative to
                        other African countries, apart from Guinea and Ghana which became
                        independent earlier. Thus our aim was to discuss concrete steps at the
                        earliest possible moment.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Mr. Dia’s ideas for the future, the Secretary said there was
                        complete agreement. Very often words that refer to ideologies—“imperialism,”
                        “domination,” and sometimes also “colonialism”—have different meanings for
                        different people and under different circumstances. He assured the Prime
                        Minister that we have no territorial ambition and no desire for territorial
                        domination. In our relations with other countries, the Secretary said, we do
                        what we can to help them. We learn from them, and they from us. It is a free
                        exchange, so that all may live independently and in peace.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister replied that he entirely agreed, that “we are on the same
                        wave length.” He had talked to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> about the colonialism resolution now before the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        <note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">A draft resolution, sponsored by 43 Asian and
                            African states, declaring the necessity of a “speedy and unconditional
                            end [to] colonialism in all its forms and manifestations” and calling
                            for immediate steps to that end. (U.N. doc. A/L.323; also printed in <hi

                        not mean advocacy of immediate withdrawal by the metropolitan powers. One
                        must try to make some <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0278"/>progress
                        without leaving chaos behind. To understand otherwise would be a bad
                        interpretation of the meaning of the resolution. Mr. Dia felt that time
                        limits should be set within which the colonial people and the metropolitan
                        power should prepare for independence.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary responded that the resolution is extremely troublesome. It is
                        so badly worded, and subject to such different interpretations, that its
                        essential aims with respect to independence and self-determination and a
                        sound evolution from colonialism are wrapped in unfortunate phrases, which
                        lend themselves to misinterpretations. It was unfortunate that the group of
                        original sponsors of the resolution did not want to amend it. They were
                        under pressure to amend it both from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss> and from certain European and moderate countries, and
                        therefore they finally decided to keep the original draft.</p>
                    <p>Prime Minister Dia said that there have been certain amendments. The amended
                        version of the draft resolution is not perfect because it is vague, but is
                        better than the first version because of its very vagueness. He added that
                        one cannot, simply because of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                        resolution, oblige a country to choose independence even though it may need
                        two or three years to prepare for it.</p>
                    <p>In response, the Secretary noted that there is a contradiction in the
                        resolution itself because the operative paragraph refers to the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter which provides for a period of
                        transition if the country is not ready for independence.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d88fn3">According to a memorandum prepared in the Secretary’s
                            office of a telephone conversation between <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> and the President that evening, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> told the President that he had
                            asked Dia “whether if the U.S. abstained they would be able to abstain
                            also.” Dia had not answered directly, but the Secretary had subsequently
                            learned that Senegal was one of the sponsors of the resolution.
                            (Eisenhower Library, <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            Papers, Telephone Conversations) On December 14, the resolution was
                            adopted by the General Assembly as Resolution 1514 (XV) by a vote of 89
                            to 0 with 9 abstentions, including the United States.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Congo, said Prime Minister Dia, is an example of what he meant. There is
                        reason to believe that Belgium’s sudden grant of independence was
                        responsible for current difficulties there. Nigeria had had an opportunity
                        to prepare, as had Ghana. In the case of Senegal, the French had never set
                        timetables, but it had been understood that autonomy would come first and
                        independence two years later. As for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                        it is a very fine institution which we should all seek to strengthen, but it
                        will enjoy authority only to the extent that it plays a realistic and
                        constructive role. It is now being used for propaganda purposes, which is
                        extremely dangerous for its future. The Secretary noted that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s speech before the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had emphasized the same point.</p>
                    <p>Continuing, Prime Minister Dia said that, as far as concrete problems are
                        concerned, the Senegalese were in touch with U.S. representatives in Dakar.
                        His technical advisors would stay behind to consult <pb n="249"
                            xml:id="pg_249" facs="0279"/>with U.S. agencies, and the Senegalese
                        would soon submit specific proposals with appropriate documentation. Until
                        now, Prime Minister Dia added, we have not hurried because we wanted to be
                        thorough. We had to set up a long-range plan first; that is finished, and in
                        January we shall be able to present the plan and serious proposals.</p>

                    <p>The President congratulated the Prime Minister on the Soviet veto at the

                            Mauritania’s application to the United Nations on December 4.</note>
                        This, he said jokingly, proves that Mauritania has already gained the status
                        of one of those powers on which the Soviets vent their ire. The President
                        said that he was hopeful that the question of admission to the United
                        Nations will be settled in spite of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The President asked whether the Prime Minister considered as serious the
                        Moroccan pretensions to Mauritania.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister answered that he did not as Morocco had neither juridical
                        nor political title and as the accession of Mauritania to independence
                        settled the question in any case.</p>
                    <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0280"/>
                    <p>The President asked about the population of Mauritania, and the Prime
                        Minister replied that the census found 650,000 people. In reality, the
                        number was closer to a million, since the greatest part of the population
                        are nomads who are hard to account for. In addition, they often give the
                        census takers less than the full count of their families, as mentioning the
                        number of one’s own children may bring the evil eye and even death to them.
                        In response to a question by the President, the Prime Minister described the
                        economic prospects of Mauritania, mentioning the very rich iron ore deposits
                        at Fort Gouraud, the somewhat less rich copper deposits and the probability
                        of finding oil in Mauritania. He stated in particular that the oil companies
                        were probably past mere exploration and were certain that oil existed in
                        Mauritania.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Prime Minister his opinion of the sudden explosion of
                        violence in Algeria and the Prime Minister indicated that he did not have
                        any recent information about the situation in Algeria. The Algerian problem
                        is of great concern to all of the African States. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is the only one capable of
                        finding a solution; unfortunately he faces opposition on the part of many
                        French politicians and of the French settlers in Algiers. In addition he
                        cannot count on the army, the attitude of which is still uncertain. The
                        solution must be found, however; otherwise France will not only lose
                        Algeria, but the friendship of the other African nations.</p>
                    <p>The President asked the Prime Minister what he thought of the present
                        situation, in which General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>
                        was caught in the middle between the ultras and the <gloss target="#t_FLN1"
                            >FLN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The Prime Minister repeated that he did not have any recent information on
                        the situation in Algeria, but that he believed that the Moslem explosion was
                        due to despair and to the fact that most Algerians are unaware of the
                        difficulties inherent in independence. At the same time, he repeated, the
                        solution must be found, as the Algerian situation is a festering wound for
                        all of Africa and for the West.</p>
                    <p>Both the President and the Prime Minister expressed their belief in the
                        sincerity of General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName>. The
                        Prime Minister reiterated that the continuation of Algerian difficulties can
                        only play into the hands of the Communists, who are exploiting it to
                        penetrate Africa. Success on their part would be a tragedy to the free world
                        as well as to Africa.</p>
                    <p>With reference to Algeria, the President stated that he felt that the
                        declaration in September, 1959, by General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                            Gaulle</persName> could provide a good basis for settlement.</p>
                    <p>The President assured the Prime Minister of the friendship of the United
                        States, and the Prime Minister assured the President of the firm attachment
                        of Mauritania to the principles of the free world.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> expressed appreciation
                            for being received by the Secretary and said that Belgium had no real
                            problems with respect to the United States or with respect to the
                            principles of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or its membership
                            therein. He said that Belgians had feelings of profound friendship for
                            the United States and that they were very grateful for what the United
                            States had done, not only for Belgium, but also for Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said there were two
                            specific points he would like to raise with the Secretary. The first one
                            was with regard to overseas territories. He recalled that Belgium
                            administered the Congo and also held a trusteeship over Ruanda-Urundi.
                            He said that the present Belgian Government had decided last June to
                            define a policy for the future of the Congo. This decision had been
                            taken not only because of internal Belgian reasons but also because of
                            developments in French Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said that Belgium had never believed that the
                            colonial <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0282"/>status of the Congo
                            would be a lasting or definitive solution. Belgium believed that the
                            success which it has had in administering the Congo and in promoting its
                            political and economic development would prove to the Congolese that a
                            continuing association with Belgium would be to their benefit. He said
                            that Government plans called for industrialization of the Congo. He
                            thought that the Congo continued to be satisfied with Belgian efforts
                            and stressed that there was no political agitation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> stressed that the trend of events
                            in Africa could have most important effects on the balance of power
                            between East and West. It was most important that European governments
                            should retain good relations with the African states. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said he hoped that the United
                            States would show an understanding towards Belgian policies in the Congo
                            and that we would not prejudge the results.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that although the US believed in the basic
                            proposition that “governments derive their just powers from the consent
                            of the governed,” this did not mean that wholly untrained people could
                            exercise these powers until they were prepared to assume them. We
                            recognized that the process of making people capable of self-government
                            was a slow and difficult one. He said that today many of the new
                            independent countries which had been basically unprepared for their
                            independence had become targets for international Communism and that
                            this often led to a dictatorship of the proletariat. We believed that
                            the governing elements should be educated, moral and self-disciplined
                            and that much time is required to achieve this degree of preparation. He
                            recalled that the United States had spent 50 years preparing the
                            Philippines for independence and there were times we believed that that
                            had perhaps not been long enough. The Secretary said that there was no
                            pressure by the United States to turn colonies into independent states
                            until they were ready for their independence. He thought that recent
                            French policy with respect to its African colonies had been drastic. The
                            independence of Guinea could only be described as “premature.” He said
                            that the admission of these newly independent, but unprepared nations
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with the same vote as older
                            and greater powers debased the concept of independent nations exercising
                            self-responsibility in international affairs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> referred to the fact that
                            today a new united Europe was being created where, although the states
                            were independent, they recognized the necessity for interdependence. The
                            Belgian Government hoped to prove to the Congo the advantages of
                            continuing interdependence between Belgium and the Congo at the time the
                            Congo gained its independence. The Secretary agreed with this concept
                            and referred to his speech in Boston on September 27 when he had said:
                            “It is coming more and more to be realized that independence, <pb
                                n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0283"/>which each of our nations
                            rightly cherishes, can only be preserved by the practice of
                                interdependence.”<note n="1" xml:id="d90fn1">For text of the speech,

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> expressed the view that
                            it was necessary to create a larger framework of EurAfrica and to forge
                            a link between Africa and the Common Market. The Secretary said he
                            agreed and thought that the future greatness of Europe depended on the
                            greater unity of continental Europe and on the greater unity between
                            continental Europe and Africa. Africa was the hinterland of Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName>, paid a courtesy call on the Acting Secretary on
                            May 13. He took the occasion to mention briefly a few of the matters
                            foremost in his mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said that, while he
                            hardly needed to reiterate Belgium’s fidelity to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, he nonetheless thought that it was
                            useful to the West to explore outstanding issues with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>He briefly expressed some concern about recent developments in the
                            institutional organizations of the Six.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then turned to the Congo
                            and made these points:</p>
                        <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>1. The Government’s proclamation as well as the special message of the
                            King announcing the new policy for the Congo<note n="1" xml:id="d91fn1"
                                >Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens announced the government’s program of
                                reforms for the Congo on January 13. King Baudouin broadcast a radio
                                message supporting the reforms on the same day.</note> had been
                            based on the results of the inquiry made by the multi-partisan Working
                            Group on Congo Policy. The proclamation had been planned for some time
                            and was not prompted in any way by the riots in Leopoldville.</p>
                        <p>2. The riots were caused principally by unemployment in Leopoldville and
                            by tribal tensions. Further, the previous government in Brussels had
                            unfortunately let matters drag with the result that there is now much
                            wasted time to make up.</p>
                        <p>3. Economic development was going forward as scheduled, the principal
                            project being the first stage of the Inga hydroelectric installation on
                            the Congo.</p>
                        <p>4. The Government plans to push ahead as quickly as feasible in
                            implementing its policy towards the Congo, the touchstone of which is
                            “interdependence.”</p>
                        <p>5. The Belgian Government hopes the U.S. will follow the implementation
                            of the Belgian program with sympathetic understanding. In the event
                            Belgium fails, it is only too obvious that the Soviets will try to fill
                            the vacuum thus created.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that, as
                            Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> had told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> last October, the U.S. was
                            following with great interest Belgian efforts in the Congo. We believe
                            that the program has a real opportunity to succeed. This will depend to
                            some extent, of course, on how it is carried out. If the Congo is to
                            evolve in a way that will encourage the retention of its ties with the
                            mother country, the manner in which assistance is provided will be
                            extremely important. It will probably be necessary, for example, to make
                            sure that the Congolese are presented with believable and realizable
                            goals along each step of the way, rather than with a distant future
                            promise that seems unattainable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said he was sure that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> appreciated this point, and added
                            that he believed the Belgian Government was on the right road in its
                            Congo program.</p>

                        <p>At his request, Monsieur Joseph Kasa-Vubu called on Assistant Secretary
                            of State <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Joseph C. Satterthwaite</persName>
                            at the Consulate General on Saturday morning, June 20. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> came to the office alone. The
                            interview lasted approximately one hour.</p>
                        <p>M. Kasa-Vubu opened the discussion by stating that his people still
                            desire immediate independence. In his opinion, the Government
                            Declaration which was a unilateral Belgian action, properly recognized
                            in its broad principles the basic right of the Congolese people to
                            accede to independence. However, according to <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasa-Vubu</persName>, the document was too fuzzy and lacked the
                            practical details for its implementation. In any event, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> believes that the Declaration
                            is now outmoded since it has been surpassed by events which have since
                            taken place.</p>
                        <p>When reminded that the Belgian Government had already brought out a draft
                            legislation dealing with the series of forthcoming elections, M.
                            Kasa-Vubu indicated he had no faith in these proposed elections since he
                            believed the Belgian authorities would rig them in their favor. In this
                            connection, he protested against the nomination by Belgian officials of
                            one-third of the members to be sent to the territorial and provincial
                            councils.</p>
                        <p>M. Kasa-Vubu referred to the present Government General as being
                            ineffectual and expressed his distrust of Belgian officials, with the
                            notable exception of Minister Maurice Van Hemelrijck.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d92fn2">Minister for the Congo.</note> He added that prior
                            to the latter’s recent visit to the Bas-Congo, Governor Jan Baptist
                            Bomans had dispatched Messrs. Gaston Diomi<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3"
                                >Burgomaster of Ngiri-Ngiri.</note> and Arthur Pinzi<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d92fn4">Burgomaster of Léopoldville.</note> to that area in
                            order to “arrange” the various public receptions. The two emissaries,
                            according to <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName>, had been
                            instructed to prepare a warm reception for the Minister on the part of
                            the natives, who were cautioned against mentioning publicly the word
                            independence. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> stated
                            that this was done in order to keep from the <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256"
                                facs="0286"/>Minister the real desire of the population for
                            immediate independence. However, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasa-Vubu</persName> continued, the people were not deceived by
                            these tactics since, during the Minister’s visit, they shouted for
                            independence and for their leader, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasa-Vubu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>M. Kasa-Vubu also declared he had requested the local authorities to
                            reinstate legally the <gloss target="#t_Abako1">Abako</gloss> movement.
                            Thus far, according to the leader, no action has been taken. He has,
                            however, made it known to the appropriate Belgian officials that if no
                            action is taken by the time the Minister leaves Leopoldville for
                            Brussels, he will take it upon himself to announce publicly the
                            reactivation of the <gloss target="#t_Abako1">Abako</gloss> party.</p>
                        <p>M. Kasa-Vubu also reiterated his desire for the establishment of a
                            federal rather than a centralized form of government. In this
                            connection, he turned over to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName> a document, a copy of which is
                                enclosed,<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">The enclosures are not filed
                                with the source text.</note> which is to be handed the Minister
                            during his visit to Leopoldville this week. The document, signed by
                            Messrs. Simon Nzeza, Daniel Kanza and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasa-Vubu</persName>, calls for the establishment by January 1,
                            1960, of the Republic of the Central Congo which is to replace the
                            present Province of Leopoldville. The government of the new republic
                            will have a President, Vice President, a Senate and a Chamber of
                            Representatives. It will have three distinct branches, the legislative,
                            the executive and the judicial. Senators and representatives are to be
                            elected by universal suffrage. The executive branch is to be composed of
                            fifteen ministries under a Prime Minister. The President of this
                            autonomous state is to be elected on December 12 and 13 of this year.
                            Finally, the document calls for electioneering to begin in July.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the interview Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName> counselled patience and moderation and
                            impressed upon <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> the
                            necessity for following a policy of non-violence. On a number of
                            occasions Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>
                            expressed his faith in the Belgian Government to carry out its promise
                            to lead the Congo to independence. He pointed to the steps which the
                            Belgian Government had already taken in order to implement its
                            Declaration. The Assistant Secretary also focussed attention on the
                            dangers of dictatorship and communism to which a precipitate acquisition
                            of independence might lead.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments:</p>
                        <p>Apparently <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> has decided to
                            press now for the establishment of a separate Bas-Congo political
                            entity. This policy can lead only to the fragmentation of the present
                            geographic unity of the Congo. It should be borne in mind that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> and his colleagues are
                            demanding the establishment, not of a provincial government, but <pb
                                n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0287"/>rather of a republic.
                            Throughout his talk, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName>
                            implied that the Bas-Congo with its ports and natural resources was a
                            wealthy territory which could be economically viable.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_Abako1">Abako</gloss> leader appeared very
                            confident both in his ideas and in his backing by the Bas-Congo
                            population. In his present state of mind, it appears unlikely that he
                            would be swayed by counsels advocating moderation or patience.</p>
                        <p>His proposed action in confronting the Minister during his forthcoming
                            visit to Leopoldville with his plan for the establishment of the Central
                            Congo Republic no doubt presages a period of intense political activity
                            on the part of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasa-Vubu</persName> and of
                            his followers. At present, Leopoldville is rife with rumors that
                            demonstrations are to break out this weekend. This may be based on
                            Minister van Hemelrijck’s visit to the city from June 23 to 28 and on
                            information contained in a tract which is now circulating, a copy of
                            which is enclosed, to the effect that on June 26 the independence of the
                            Bas-Congo is to be proclaimed.</p>

                        <p>At the 423d meeting of the National Security Council on November 5,
                            Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen

                            Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W.
                                Boggs</persName>, dated November 5, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said the last item he wished to report
                            on concerned the Belgian Congo and the Cameroons. Recent riots in
                            Stanleyville had been triggered by the arrest of nationalist leaders,
                            while sporadic disorders in Leopoldville had been a reaction to the
                            Schrijver Plan, which provides for independence of the Congo in four
                            years. These disorders are led by organized agitators in the cities
                            although apathy still exists in the countryside. Certificates of merit
                            for revolutionists are being sold for sixty francs in the Congo. The
                            President remarked that this was a new way to get money. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> had just returned from a month in
                            the area and had been very helpful in providing information. The
                            President said he wondered how such areas as the Congo with no seaports
                            could be economically viable unless they joined some sort of larger
                            federation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            said <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0288"/>that fantastic language
                            barriers existed in Central Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                                >Stans</persName> noted that strong tribal animosities existed there
                            also. If the authority of the central government were weakened, tribal
                            violence would no doubt break out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                                >Stans</persName> also noted that radio is now having a great
                            influence on the natives, who listen mostly to Radio Cairo and Radio
                            Brazzaville. So far as he could tell, no one listened to the Voice of
                            America. There would probably be a great deal of bloodshed in the Congo
                            before the political problems of the area were settled. The President
                            asked what weapons were used in tribal warfare. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said the tribes used
                            muzzle-loading rifles, knives and spears, because they had not been
                            permitted to acquire more modern weapons. The U.S. and U.K. missionaries
                            were very much concerned about the possibility of tribal warfare.
                            However, the Belgians took a fatalistic attitude toward developments,
                            with Belgian Government officials and businessmen wanting nothing so
                            much as to get out of the area before trouble starts. The Congo has
                            great manpower and natural resources, but enormous capital would be
                            required to develop them. While the natives of the area shout for
                            independence, their concept of independence is very vague and generally
                            can be reduced to the hope of getting a handout from the government. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said he was forced to
                            conclude that the best thing for the area would be a plan which did not
                            grant independence for twenty-five years.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman

                                warned that the U.S. policy of leaving responsibility for the Congo
                                to Belgium risked the failure of the long-term U.S. objective of the
                                emergence of a stable, Western-oriented Congo. It urged a more
                                active U.S. role, suggested areas of possible U.S. assistance to the
                                Congo, and recommended an approach to the Belgian Government as a
                                first step. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 611.55A/12–1059)</note>

                            consultation, Department has concluded it would be desirable for
                            Ambassador (with subsequent assistance such other members of the Embassy
                            staff as he may consider advisable) to undertake a series of discussions
                            with appropriate Belgian officials in order obtain their assessment of
                            developments in Congo. We would be particularly interested in Belgian

                            political groupings, and Belgian plans for continuing economic and
                            technical assistance to Congo. We would hope that from these discussions
                            would come a continuing exchange of views between US and Belgian
                            authorities in Brussels and Leopoldville at various levels and in

                        <p>Department believes Ambassador’s absence on leave during period of

                            tend to generate Belgian suspicion or antagonism. Furthermore,
                            developments over past months confirm Belgians much more ready to
                            consult with US, if not to solicit our advice or assistance.</p>

                            unstable pattern in Congo.</p>
                        <p>In course discussions, Belgians may well ask for US views concerning
                            Belgium’s Congo program. Ambassador authorized respond that US is of
                            course interested in maintenance political stability in Congo and
                            general alignment of area with Free World. We believe that the aims of
                            present Belgian policy in the Congo are laudable and hope that they can
                            be attained in harmonious cooperation. Should Belgians officially
                            request public statement US views, Ambassador may state that he will
                            explore feasibility such action with Department.</p>
                        <p>If Belgians should raise question of US economic or technical assistance
                            in Congo, Ambassador should point out that funds available for such
                            purposes extremely limited and established US policy permits US action
                            in these fields only when metropole unable meet territory’s
                            requirements. We would be prepared examine any Belgian proposal, but
                            could not make any commitment. We would also attempt make available
                            information concerning private US funds which possibly could be drawn
                            on.</p>
                        <p>Most pressing need would appear to be in field training for public
                            administration and Embassy should discuss this with Belgians. Experience
                            with other colonial and ex-colonial powers has shown however this is
                            very sensitive area and US assistance not generally welcomed.</p>

                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Although Department realizes
                            possible danger in becoming identified too closely with Belgian colonial
                            policy, we nevertheless believe that cooperation with Belgians in
                            pursuing common aims offers us best, if not only, means of influencing
                            future independent Congo. We therefore envisage Ambassador and staff
                            discussions with Belgians as first phase of exploratory operation
                            designed identify areas of common interest in which US can be of
                            assistance to Belgians in maintaining and promoting orderly progress
                            toward Congolese autonomy.</p>
                        <p>We must also keep in mind repercussions elsewhere both in Europe and
                            Africa of any vigorous US action in the Congo. For example, any
                            substantial aid program would certainly result in US being faced with
                            shopping list from any number of emerging African nations. Other
                            metropolitan powers for different reasons might resent US attention to
                            Congo and independent African states could if we were not careful
                            interpret out actions as attempt preserve colonialism. These
                            considerations may be of minor significance and need not inhibit Embassy
                            in its discussion with Belgians but are mentioned to emphasize area wide
                            implications of problem. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.<note

                            Govt was handling difficult situation with great wisdom and flexibility.
                            He added that from over-all point of view it would have been better if
                            there had been more time to work out complicated process of setting up
                            new independent state, but he realized that this time did not exist
                            because of strength of forces pressing towards independence.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador said his Government earnestly hoped that American private
                            interests would invest in Congo with of course necessary guarantees and
                            safeguards. He suggested US Govt, might encourage such investments. He
                            added his Govt, hoped that US would understand and support Belgian
                            efforts. Secretary replied that we viewed Belgian efforts most
                            sympathetically and that in deciding what we could do in present
                            situation we wanted to consult with Belgian authorities. He recognized
                            that this was preoccupying problem for Belgians and hoped that they
                            would feel free to talk to us at any time. He considered that the

                            time of independence, with an experienced career officer as ambassador,
                            and he suggested several possible steps to provide economic assistance
                            to the Congo, arguing that as the third most populous African country
                            with “a potentially explosive political situation,” it required “unusual
                            attention.” There was some discussion of this, with Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observing that the
                            Special Africa Fund, one of the possible sources of aid for the Congo,
                            was part of the special assistance fund which had been reduced from the
                            administration’s original request. At the conclusion of the meeting, he
                            asked Deputy Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>
                            to coordinate action on the various problems associated with the Congo’s

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Patrice Lumumba</persName> arrived about a
                            half an hour late for the appointment (which had been postponed twice
                            before), having left a meeting in the Congo Minister’s office for the
                            purpose. From the <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0293"/>financial
                            point of view, it is worth noting that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> kept a taxi waiting in front of the Embassy for
                            the forty minutes or so which was covered by our conversation.</p>
                        <p>Personally, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> gave much the
                            same impression in private conversation as he has in public
                            appearances—a highly articulate, sophisticated, subtle and unprincipled
                            intelligence. He seemed reasonably well aware of what his audience would
                            be interested in hearing and of what would make a good impression on
                            them, and showed considerable sophistication in general when discussing
                            political aspects. On economics and more concrete subjects, however, he
                            tended to deal more in clichés than in specific or consequent ideas. In
                            short, he gives the impression of a man who would probably go far in
                            spite of the fact that almost nobody trusts him; who is certainly for
                            sale, but only on his own terms; and who would probably not meet the
                            famous definition which was given a century ago of the honest politician
                            as one who, when bought, stayed bought.</p>
                        <p>The following were the principal points of interest arising out of the
                            conversation:</p>
                        <p>1) <hi rend="italic">Attitude Toward Belgians.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> maintained with us the
                            public posture which he has taken up ever since he arrived at the Round
                            Table—of a fundamental friendliness toward Belgium and a willingness or
                            even desire to work with the Belgians in the period after independence.
                            He pointed out to us that he had been among the first to take up a
                            position against the Belgians and to insist on the need for immediate
                            independence, at a time when Belgium was opposed to it. It had been
                            necessary to fight until the Belgians had accepted this requirement.
                            Now, however, that agreement had been reached on the date of
                            independence, the important thing was to concentrate on what would
                            happen once independence had arrived, and it was clear that during this
                            period the Congo would have every need of Belgium’s help, in terms of
                            technicians and economic aid. Therefore, said <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, the Congo must be prepared to work loyally with
                            Belgium and he, for one, intended to preach this doctrine in his
                            electoral campaign. He also believed it very important that now that the
                            promise of the date of independence had been received, the Congolese
                            political leaders do everything in their power to prevent disorders
                            which might lead to a postponement of this date. This is why he was
                            intending himself to make an immediate swing around the Congo on his
                            return in order to preach moderation and a calming of spirits.</p>
                        <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Communism.</hi> On this subject <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> talked a very good game indeed.
                            He spoke of the intense activity of the Soviets and Czechs at the Round
                            Table and the fact that they had persuaded a certain number of his Round
                            Table colleagues to pay visits to Eastern Europe. He himself, he said,
                            had been approached with offers to visit the Soviet Union and, I
                            believe, Communist China, but he had turned <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264"
                                facs="0294"/>these down because he believed that these influences
                            from the East were very bad from the point of view of the Congo. The
                            Communists said they wanted to help the Congo, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, but he was well aware that what
                            they really wanted to do was to install a dictatorship there and thus
                            substitute one form of imperialism for another. He had, therefore,
                            turned down these invitations and had gone farther by attacking publicly
                            at the Round Table the white advisers to certain of the Congolese groups
                            (presumably in particular Jean Terfve, Belgian Communist Party member
                            who was an official adviser to the <gloss target="#t_CEREA1"
                                >CEREA</gloss> delegation), and insisting they be forced to leave
                            the Conference room.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is a smart-enough cookie
                            to have been well aware that he was giving a line which would not fall
                            upon unfriendly ears in this conversation. Nevertheless, the
                            completeness of his argument and statement of position was interesting,
                            and the fact that not only <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            but also Ngalula<note n="1" xml:id="d97fn1">Joseph Ngalula of the <hi

                            the same terms shows that this problem has been a subject of discussion
                            among the Congolese and that they are not quite as naive as might be
                            expected. Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            own disclaimers are not necessarily inconsistent with other reports that
                            he is receiving money and support from Eastern Europe; the more likely
                            explanation or resolution of these apparently conflicting positions is
                            that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s outside financial
                            support has come largely from Accra and possibly from Conakry and that
                            some of these funds in turn may originate in Soviet sources. In any
                            case, it seems clear that if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is receiving any specific support from the East,
                            he is perfectly prepared to betray these supporters to the fullest
                            extent that suits his purposes.)</p>
                        <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Economic Ideas.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s specific ideas on
                            economic development of the Congo, which he, of course, said he believed
                            was of primordial importance, were rather vague. He spoke in general
                            terms for both industrial and agricultural development, but he talked
                            largely in clichés and without seeming to have any precise proposals at
                            this time nor any particularly coherent doctrine, except that the unity
                            of the Congo, which is the central core of his political doctrine, was
                            necessary among other things for economic reasons.</p>
                        <p>4) <hi rend="italic">Outside Assistance.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s views on foreign aid
                            follow roughly from his views on economic questions. He recognizes that
                            considerable assistance will be necessary and talked in terms of
                            technicians and financial assistance. He obviously looks primarily to
                            Belgium, at least in the first stage, to provide this assistance, and
                            his political campaign centers around this expectation. However, he
                            clearly believes that the Congo will have to turn to other sources as
                            well as time goes on. As to exactly what will be needed, however, he <pb
                                n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0295"/>seems to have no clear or
                            specific ideas except that at one point in the conversation he was quite
                            emphatic on the special need for vocational education at the secondary
                            level in the Congo, and he thought that this was something that the US
                            might be particularly able to help with.</p>
                        <p>5) <hi rend="italic">Foreign Investment.</hi> On this subject <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s ideas are considerably more
                            clear and developed. In fact, he has been preaching ever since his visit
                            to Brussels in April or May of 1959 the doctrine that the Congo would
                            protect foreign investment, both Belgian and other, provided that an
                            independent Congolese government were available for the purpose, and he
                            has used this consistently as an argument for rapid movement toward
                            independence. His basic line on this subject, then, is in terms of
                            political guarantees for foreign investment, which is prepared to accept
                            and work within the framework of Congolese independence. He gives the
                            impression, however, that he is thinking essentially in terms of large
                            industries such as Union Miniere and of the basic guarantees against
                            expropriation and for the repatriation of profits, rather than in terms
                            of specific investment in other realms. It would perhaps be natural that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should be primarily
                            interested in working with the big companies which are already a
                            political power in Congo, but he gave no particular indication one way
                            or the other on this subject. The only specific investment which he
                            mentioned in the course of the conversation was the INGA project,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">A planned hydroelectric power project.</note>
                            which he emphasized was most important and should be pursued as rapidly
                            as possible. He thought that this should be one of the principal tasks
                            of the new, independent government after the first of July.</p>

                            to confirm Ngalula’s statement that the Congolese have an “image” of the
                            US which is very favorable and that this is due in no small measure to
                            the feeling that the American Negroes come in important numbers
                            originally from the Congo and are hence the “brothers” of the Congolese.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> added one particular
                            story in this connection—that people who had come to see him in jail in
                            Stanleyville had told him on two occasions of the arrival of American
                            planes in Stanleyville, which they believed had come to “liberate” him.
                            This rumor, then, is not limited to Leopoldville alone.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said that immediately
                            after his return to Leopoldville on February 28, he intended to make a
                            quick swing around the Congo to make contact again with the population,
                            a contact of which he has been deprived for some months, and at the <pb

                            and to prepare his political campaign. Although we opened the
                            conversation by congratulating him on his appointment to the
                            “Administrative Committee” attached to the Governor General, he had
                            little or nothing to say on the subject, and gave the impression that he
                            did not expect his membership on this committee to interfere severely
                            with his travel in the interests of his political campaign. He made it
                            very clear that he wanted an invitation to visit the US, that he would
                            be able to go probably only for a week or a little more at most, and
                            that it was possible for him to go only before the beginning of the
                            political campaign—that is to say, in the course of the month of March.
                            After that he would be involved in the campaign and after June 30 he
                            expected to be too concerned with governmental affairs to do very much
                            else. The matter of a possible invitation to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                        <p>DEAR DOUG: I returned from the Congo on April 1 to find your very helpful

                        <p>I am delighted that you can find a top notch Ambassador. My recent trip
                            to the Congo and preliminary conversations upon my return here have
                            served to strengthen my conviction that this is of the first
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>On this subject and others, my trip to the Congo was of immense value to
                            me. I had a long talk with Minister de Schrijver and Minister <persName

                        <p>Minister de Schrijver informed me that the Russians will definitely have
                            an Ambassador in Leopoldville July 1 and thinks it very desirable for
                            the new American Ambassador to be there at the same time. This is
                            reported in our telegram No. 1158 dated April 5, I960.<note n="3"

                            feeling is that this is very important, not simply as a question of
                            competition with the East, but also because the problems facing the new
                            Congolese State will be of such magnitude and difficulty that it will be
                            very important for our Ambassador to be on the scene just as soon as he
                            possibly can.</p>
                        <p>de Schrijver told me that if the elections go smoothly, in the sense that
                            one coalition has a working majority, there should be a provisional
                            Congolese Government in being by June 15, which could o.k. the agrément
                            for our Ambassador. Whatever the possibility in this regard, I am
                            convinced that we must proceed with our planning on this basis.</p>

                        <p>I agree with you that Bob Murphy is an excellent choice for the head of
                            the delegation and I do hope you can get him. de Schrijver said it has
                            been definitely agreed by the Congolese Executive College in
                            Leopoldville that the main Independence Day ceremonies will take place
                            in Leopoldville. There may be a brief ceremonial visit to Luluabourg by
                            the foreign delegations but this will not involve staying overnight.
                            Independence Day ceremonies should last only two or three days, which
                            will make it easy on the delegation.</p>

                                Léopoldville on March 8. According to the memorandum of conversation
                                by Cleveland, Cornélis “made it clear almost immediately that he was
                                not enthusiastic about the US doing very much in the technical

                                    >MSP</gloss>/3–960)</note> It seems to me this problem falls
                            under three general headings:</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>a. It is very important that the United States demonstrate its interest
                            in the Congo and its friendliness towards the new Congolese Government
                            in a concrete way as soon as possible. This should be done by a few
                            projects which are themselves economically sound and contribute to the
                            well-being of the new Congolese state. My first suggestion in this line
                            would be that the gift of one or more complete technical schools, with
                            staff, would have an enormous impact, in addition to being very badly
                            needed by the Congo. Everyone to whom we spoke on our trip, Congolese
                            and Belgians alike, brought up the necessity for more and better
                            technical education as their first point and asked for United States aid
                            in this field.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, scholarships in the United States would meet a real Congolese
                            desire and immediately demonstrate United States sympathy and interest
                            without requiring lengthy project preparation or great cost. In the few
                            meetings we had with groups of Africans, the most frequently asked
                            question was “What is the United States going to do to provide
                            scholarships for us to study in the United States?” I suspect that one
                            explanation of this is the fact, which I discovered in Bukavu, that
                            Radio Moscow’s announcement of a “free university” for Africans in
                            Moscow has received very broad currency even among the ordinary people
                            in the eastern part of the Congo. The announcement of perhaps two
                            hundred American scholarships at the June 30 celebrations would have an
                            immediate and salutary impact throughout the Congo, with keen
                            competition for every scholarship.</p>
                        <p>The Congo also desperately needs improved communications. This could take
                            one of two possible lines: either aid to the present radio-broadcasting
                            service, the power of which is now quite inadequate, or help in
                            installing an improved telephone service. Technical and programming aid
                            to the Congolese radio service would permit the presence of American
                            advisors with obvious advantages. Some Congolese have already asked me
                            for such aid. It seems significant to me that Russians are operating the
                            Guinea radio system and Ghana is greatly strengthening its radio set-up.
                            So far as the telephone service goes, the present Congolese system,
                            which is by radio, is most unsatisfactory, being limited to a few hours
                            every day and providing very poor service. My suggestion would be to
                            pick up the proposal in the new Belgian ten-year plan for a coaxial
                            cable linking the principal cities. A microwave system might be a better
                            technical solution, but in either case improved telephone service would
                            do much to tie the Congo together and reduce divisive influences.</p>
                        <p>While on this subject, I might mention that Voice of America broadcasts
                            to the Congo, and I suspect most of Africa, appeared to be quite
                            inadequate from a technical and content point of view. The only stations
                            bringing international news clearly to the Congo are Brazzaville <pb
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0299"/>(twice as powerful as the
                            Leopoldville radio), Radio Cairo and Radio Moscow. I will take this
                            matter up with <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName>, but
                            I am mentioning it here for the sake of completeness.</p>
                        <p>I do not know what the cost of the above projects would be. My thought is
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Survey Team, which I am
                            going to discuss below, should turn its attention to this type of
                            project first because of the time factor involved, with the hope that an
                            announcement of one or more American projects along these lines could be
                            made at the Independence Day ceremonies on June 30.</p>
                        <p>Since time is very much of the essence I hope that funds for the above
                            could be obtained from the President’s Contingency Fund. Although I do
                            not know the status of the Fund at this time, it is my impression that
                            there is usually money available at the end of the fiscal year. I hope
                            that you will keep our problem on this in mind, since there may be the
                            danger of having whatever is now in the Fund obligated for other less
                            urgent and perhaps less worthwhile projects. Can you see that around $5
                            million is set aside for the Congo for such projects, pending
                            justification by the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Study Team, so
                            that we are sure of having an amount on hand?</p>
                        <p>b. In addition to the one or two projects for immediate announcement
                            which I have discussed above, the main purpose of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Study Team will be to discover, examine
                            and approve various technical aid projects. On this subject the Governor
                            General and the Congolese Executive College at Leopoldville should issue
                            a formal invitation to the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Survey
                            Team around April 11. de Schrijver and <persName corresp="#p_SBL1"
                                >Scheyven</persName> emphasized to me the necessity of the team
                            arriving just as soon as possible, thus abruptly adopting a position we
                            have been trying to get them to agree to for quite some time now.</p>
                        <p>It is our hope that the team will leave Washington around April 15, spend

                            hope that they will first examine and approve one or two projects of the

                            the necessary financial arrangements before Independence Day. In
                            addition to these projects, we suggest that they go more thoroughly into
                            the fields of technical training, teaching of English and

                            take active role in Congo. Some elements in Belgian
                            Government—particularly both Congo Ministers—more and more tending
                            encourage our efforts this direction. Nevertheless, mere fact we are
                            seeking play active role makes our relations with Belgium delicate. US
                            starts with good reservoir of credit because of traditionally
                            circumspect attitude toward Belgium’s Congo possession. But we are
                            treading narrow path and should not jeopardize our position by

                            Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W.
                                Boggs</persName>, May 5, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the prospective independence
                            of the Belgian Congo on June 30 of this year had led to frantic efforts
                            by the Belgians to help the Congo develop a viable government. These
                            efforts were handicapped by the fact that some 80-odd political parties
                            existed in the Congo. The President said he did not know that many
                            people in the Congo could read. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                            conflicts between tribes in the Congo would present one difficult
                            problem. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would probably
                            emerge as the leader of the Congo. He was irresponsible, had been
                            charged with embezzlement, was now being offered bribes from various
                            sources and was supported by the Belgian Communists. The Belgians were
                            trying to get the U.S. to provide financial aid to meet the deficit in
                            the Congo. Belgium believes that $125–$ 130 million in economic aid will
                            be required before the Congo achieves its independence if chaos is to be
                            avoided. The flight of capital from the Congo is being accelerated to
                            such an extent that Belgium recently imposed controls on the export of
                            capital. Finally, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> reported, there is
                            some possibility that a movement might develop in the rich Katanga area
                            for separation from the Congo and union with Rhodesia.” (Eisenhower

                            its wholly democratic basis unsuited to the Congolese at this stage of
                            their development. Pre-local authority and something approaching
                            dictatorship at the national level is necessary to hold the country
                            together. Governor Stenmans of Leopoldville Province, one of ablest and
                            most confident of Belgian administrators, is still hopeful coalition
                            will be formed but deeply disturbed by Bakongo separatism displaying
                            itself before national government formed. But neither he nor any
                            officials other than Department have suggested any US involvement in
                            influencing Congolese on political side. We have no idea whether
                            Belgians have any alternative plan of action in mind if chaotic
                            situation develops as result of failure to form a temporarily stable
                            government of premature breakup into tribal groupings.</p>

                            built around him, preferably a government embracing the other major
                            parties, with an appropriate cut in the pie. If the wherewithal is
                            immediately provided in the form of substantial financial aid by the

                        <p>In view of the foregoing we believe we should talk with Congolese leaders
                            along following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. It is our hope that Congo will emerge as one free and independent
                            state in which the Congolese peoples can win the confidence of the
                            nations of the free world and contribute to their future well-being and
                            prosperity, while at the same time developing their own internal
                            institutions in such a manner as to satisfy regional aspirations of
                            their peoples. While not discouraging federation we should counsel
                            against balkanization and separatism as defeating opportunity for
                            realization of greater economic and political benefits for the Congolese
                            peoples as <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0307"/>a whole and express
                            US interest in extending assistance to a Congolese Government which is
                            truly representative of all the Congolese peoples.</p>
                        <p>2. Encourage leaders in formation of government of national unity,
                            without mentioning leadership or favoritism toward any one of them and
                            suggesting such a government more auspicious from the standpoint of
                            effective use of US aid after independence.</p>
                        <p>We believe talks along these lines will demonstrate sympathetic US
                            interest and bolster confidence (and compromise) among Congolese leaders
                            when it is desperately needed.</p>
                        <p>Unless Department instructs us otherwise, we propose following this
                            course.</p>

                                Katangan independence on June 30. When Tshombe inquired as to the
                                U.S. attitude, Tomlinson told him the United States could give no
                                advice, but “as friend to friend,” he advised working within the
                                framework of the future Congolese Government. (<hi rend="italic"

                            considered view that detachment of Katanga from Congo under present
                            circumstances would lead to chain reaction in other areas which might
                            very well result in disorder and bloodshed throughout Congo. There is
                            definitely no possibility US troops will be sent Katanga in event attack
                            by <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> forces. As is well
                            known US Government feels that fragmentation of Africa highly
                            undesirable. Therefore we would very much hope that Tshombe could find
                            it possible to continue to work within framework of Congo

                                Lumumba</persName> is emerging as the strong man. His government,
                            however, is weak and will have a Leftist tinge with five out of his ten
                            cabinet ministers being inclined toward communism. <persName

                            in attitude, with a Leftist and opportunistic bent. He is reported to
                            have solicited communist funds to help him obtain his present political
                            position. President <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> may

                            extent. With its grave economic problems, the Congo will be susceptible
                            to Sino-Soviet offers of economic assistance. The Chinese Communists
                            have already recognized the Congo and the Tass News Agency reported last

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> responded first with his
                            (oft-repeated) political views—that the Congo to remain unified must
                            have a unitary and not federal form of government. Federalism in Africa
                            would soon become tribalism and cause break-up of Congo. Nevertheless
                            the provinces should have substantial measure of autonomy for local
                            affairs.</p>

                            said the Congo would maintain a neutral position. Questioned by

                                >Lumumba</persName> quickly replied he did not wish the Congo, after
                            having gained its independence to lose it through domination by other
                            power. He then asserted that Communist ideology was not for the
                            Congolese who were freedom-loving people and Christian. The Congolese
                            looked to US, Belgium and other Western democracies for support and
                            especially US which was known to favor emancipation of African
                            peoples.</p>
                        <p>On economic side <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> stressed
                            need for development capital and asserted guarantees would be given for
                            protection private investments and property. Referred to urgent need for
                            development in agricultural and industrial fields and exploitation of
                            Congo’s resources including INGA.</p>
                        <p>Psychologically it was important for US to provide aid immediately and to
                            give training opportunities to Congolese in US. Ambassador reminded
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> our intention provide

                            accept Ambassador Burden’s invitation for US visit this spring expressed

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s quick switch from
                            neutrality to expression of seemingly pro-US, pro-Western sentiments is
                            typical of his character in suiting his words to his audience. We do not
                            consider that his bid for US and Western aid in any way implies he would
                            not accept aid from Communist countries. Implication in our view is that
                            if we are not here soon with enough aid the Communist will be. Same
                            implication applies to suggestion concerning President’s visit in view

                        <p>Government is striving to maintain loyalty of Force Publique and its
                            dedication to maintenance law and order. As Department aware certain
                            demands have been met, i.e., sharp reduction Belgian officers,
                            promotions. These may not prove sufficient if Force Publique does not
                            actively and loyally support government, no other effective instrument
                            available except foreign aid which I feel probably would not be
                            requested until last minute, perhaps after balloon has gone up. From our
                            own direct experience, at least some of Force Publique have deliberately
                            and without provocation or even encountering effort self-defense (which
                            might have been fatal error) severely roughed up Americans on streets,
                            robbing one as well. This pattern makes for great uncertainty regarding
                            whom to trust, or indeed for how long. Should Force Publique break down
                            wholly or in substantial degree, Africans (already being harangued by
                            some radio speeches re disparity wages and living standards) might start
                            sacking and worse. According to very highly-placed government official
                            this likely. That would require fast and strong action before too
                            late.</p>
                        <p>Any such action however would entail obvious risks—would be likely make
                            pot really boil over and immediately endanger many isolated people not
                            so far known to be in trouble. This would more likely be case if Belgian
                            troops used though I admit no other substantial force apparently now in
                            neighborhood. Even some other force would have only slight advantage
                            since so few Force Publique or Congolese would recognize difference or
                            care.</p>
                        <p>I intend strongly recommend evacuation women, children, and non-essential
                            Embassy personnel, preferably by boat. We were told by Chief State’s
                            secretary yesterday no permission would be given but if necessary I
                            intend go to government this morning saying US Government would take
                            very serious view denial inherent right all people be permitted evacuate
                            especially if requested by diplomatic representative. French got off by
                            boat and Sabena took off mixed planeload last night including few
                            Americans.</p>

                            followed by another day or so later. My considered opinion, we should
                            try get out indicated Americans and recommend return only after we have
                            reasonable assurance (1) Force Publique firmly established as reliable

                            already talked to Lumumbu [<hi rend="italic">Joseph Yumbu</hi>] Vice
                            President of Provincial Council Leopoldville along following lines:</p>
                        <p>Departure of Belgians, which would probably be followed by practically
                            all Europeans, would convert modern Congo to jungle. Neither Congolese
                            nor Belgians wish reestablish Belgian domination. Belgians agreed employ
                            Belgian troops yesterday only under most extreme pressure and with
                            greatest possible reluctance.</p>
                        <p>Fact is Force Publique not under effective command nor is its loyalty by
                            any means assured. Command is not exercisable by negotiation nor is
                            loyalty insured by sops.</p>
                        <p>I have suggested to Yumbu he find <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> at earliest possible moment, repeat what I told

                            Congo caviar. I assume most Americans have not yet developed a great
                            taste for it either.</p>
                        <p>Formula would involve sending immediately a commander-in-chief of United
                            Nations forces who would take command of Belgian forces already there as
                            part of United Nations force. Later Belgians might be gradually

                            must do this at the earliest possible moment if he is to be believed
                            around the world as acting on his own initiative and not with a Belgian
                            pistol at this head. That’s my thesis.</p>
                        <p>I talked at length with Bunche yesterday to discover how long it might
                            reasonably take for Security Council to get effective forces moving.
                            Bunche said in a matter of hours following Security Council decision and
                            that required official government request.</p>

                            believe they would make vast error in judging public opinion around the
                            world by doing so. Furthermore, assume this could be taken up with
                            Assembly on urgent basis if Security Council failed due to Russian

                        <p>1. Belgian troops already engaged in de facto intervention. As long as

                            saving lives, even most rabid anti-colonialists will have difficulty

                            in opposition to Congolese Government. If as Timberlake suggests Belgian

                            responsibility requested by Congolese (whether government or <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> himself) then there is perhaps
                            a possibility of arresting anarchy and creating some foundation on which
                            to rebuild an organized society in the Congo without creating permanent
                            break between Belgians and Congolese or encountering adverse world
                            reaction which we fear will greet present Belgian plan.</p>
                        <p>3. Belgian Government and people united in support any necessary use
                            Belgian troops to protect and evacuate white population from Congo.
                            Despite decisions it has taken, government appears confused and divided
                            re measures beyond, and deathly afraid of popular reaction here which
                            already beginning Brussels this morning. Conservative faction (<persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> and liberals) appears favor
                            unilateral intervention already decided (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                                >Embtels</gloss> 77 and 78) but some others apparently concerned at
                            possible destruction long-range Belgian position by such a move. Latter
                            group might support United Nations initiative as way out of dilemma. Do
                            not know De Schrijver’s position but from past performance expect he
                            would approve of United Nations solution at east as second-best to
                            Congo-requested Belgian intervention.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I believe Timberlake should be encouraged proceed on proposed
                            lines and United States should prepare itself politically and
                            practically to support <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>

                            United Nations assistance. Other question was who would bear expense of
                            seeking and maintaining United Nations forces and what would become of
                            defense budget. I suggested those questions be taken up after the first

                            on Belgian and Western position of world reaction to general military
                            intervention. I said I thought it was extremely important international
                            public relations in this connection be handled with extreme care. I
                            pointed out that no effective objection could be made by anyone to use
                            of troops for <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0320"/>humanitarian
                            purpose of saving lives in a situation of anarchy. However, maintenance
                            of order in the general sense is a function of sovereignty and if
                            Belgium makes public announcement that it is taking over this function
                            in the Congo, without being asked by the Congolese Republic, it would,
                            however unfairly, be widely accused of reimposing colonial status
                            despite disclaimers. I therefore thought it most important that any
                            public statement that be [was] made make very clear that military
                            actions being taken were to save lives of Europeans and that no
                            statement be made indicating that was Belgian intention to take over
                            function of restoring and maintaining public order as a whole in Congo.
                            These are my personal views and were so described to <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> responded that he was fully
                            aware of the importance of this distinction. He read me cables from Van
                            Den Bosch in Leopoldville emphasizing danger of widespread intervention
                            of paratroopers in Leopoldville. Van Den Bosch also suggested that
                            statement be made saying that troop action was to save European lives
                            and property with no political intent whatever. Once lives were safe
                            troops would return to their bases.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said that as a result of our

                            clear.</p>
                        <p>I thanked him for help of Belgian troops in saving lives of Americans in

                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said it would be much
                            appreciated if space could be found on American airplanes returning to
                            Brussels for Belgian refugees. Told him of two C–124’s in Brazzaville.
                            Also said there was extreme shortage of fuel at Kamina constituting
                            serious problem to evacuation and was there anything we could do to
                            help. Emphasized Congo developments constitute serious problem for

                            appropriate officers and technical personnel, which should be African to
                            extent possible, to train Congo Army. “Training” involves prompt

                            the two companies of the 24th Infantry now on stand-by basis in Germany
                            should be flown down to Brazzaville. Their presence there would have a

                            few days. He pointed this out to the Congolese Government and said that
                            he did not wish to have American troops shooting Congolese. He told the
                            Congolese Government that unless it would assure adequate food supplies,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> will
                            recommend against the entry of American troops.</p>

                            Hammarskjold is now meeting with the African Ambassadors at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and is hoping he can work it out through
                            them rather than through the Whites.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what we had said to the Congo.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we have said nothing yet but we plan to say we are in
                            consultation with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on this whole
                            matter. The Secretary said he would be very adverse to sending in our
                            troops in these circumstances.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>The President said that was right; that he didn’t think any Western
                            troops should go in; that he would rather see Turkish or Pakistani
                            troops if they can’t get African troops.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there has been a ticker report that our Ambassador
                            gave agreement in principle to this request. The Secretary said there is
                            no indication our Ambassador did anything of the sort and we will have
                            to deny that he has given agreement in principle.</p>
                        <p>The President said we are always willing to do our duty through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but we are not going to
                            unilaterally get into this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said our Ambassador also reported a possible serious food
                            problem in Leopoldville and the Secretary said we are looking to see if
                            we can help out in that regard.</p>
                        <p>The President said this was all right and commented that maybe after this
                            situation some of these people won’t want now to be independent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he felt we should send something to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> to say we can’t undertake to
                            send troops as U.S. troops but we are discussing the situation with the
                            Secretary-General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at the
                            present time. The Secretary said Hammarskjold wants to arrange for
                            colored, French-speaking officers.</p>
                        <p>The President said there is nothing more we can do now except keep in
                            touch with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President said we
                            would be completely in error to go in unilaterally.</p>

                            HAMMARSKJOLD</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hammarskjold telephoned to say he had just finished his meeting with
                            the whole African group regarding the Congolese request for technical
                            assistance from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and this group was
                            very much back of his line. The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said
                            what is practical depends very much on the Congo Government. The <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said so far so good and he <pb n="297"
                                xml:id="pg_297" facs="0327"/>could say he has tied it up there but
                            is having a meeting of the members of the Security Council in the
                            morning—not the Security Council itself, but the members of the Council.
                            The <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said there is one curiosity in
                            this, i.e. they have not yet received the formal request, but <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he will go ahead anyway. The
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said there is another side, i.e.
                            the request to the U.S., but that in no way collides with the request to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary said we do not want
                            to do a single thing which we do not do under <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> auspices. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he
                            hasn’t yet found where to put this. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            said he saw the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss>’s point in keeping
                            this neutral. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said this is one of
                            those situations where we must innovate and we must find a formula.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is coming this afternoon and
                            they might see what formula is available. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said he took very definite stand we should not go into
                            a new framework but that doesn’t solve the <gloss target="#t_Secy1"
                                >Secy</gloss>’s problem or his. The Secretary said we have
                            instructed our Ambassador that with the appeal having gone to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that this matter was within
                            Hammarskjold’s competence and that we are not going to make any
                            independent move. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said let us then
                            see what this afternoon brings.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said there was one matter he
                            would like to mention confidentially. Some days ago as a matter of
                            precaution we sent an aircraft carrier<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">The
                                    <hi rend="italic">Wasp.</hi>
                            </note> to stand by out of sight outside with helicopters in case they
                            were needed for rescue of people and <gloss target="#t_Secy1"
                                >Secy</gloss> said there are some Marines aboard, but the ship will
                            not arrive until the 21st. The <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss>
                            said we have kept this very secret. The Secretary said he personally had
                            a strong feeling that white troops not speaking French should not go
                            into that area. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he agreed; that
                            this would only aggravate the situation. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said we should continue working on line to put the
                            responsibility on the Congo and then one can use some white troops.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said if they just used their
                            police functions, he knew he didn’t have to tell the <gloss
                                target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> the repercussions. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said of course we can’t help some
                            cold-war overtones. The Secretary referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s attack on the Belgian
                            Government’s actions.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">Reference is to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s remarks at a
                                July 12 news conference in Moscow.</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he had not seen this but could
                            tell the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> that the African
                            Ambassadors in <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss> did not look at us in
                            that light. The <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said in what he
                            was saying about troops, he didn’t want the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> to feel we wouldn’t want to do our share. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he understood. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that of course our people could do
                            the job, but with what consequences. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            said that is a real snag and a similar snag is can we find new kind of
                            formula where this can be done at the request of the Government. The
                            Secretary said we will keep in touch and we will do nothing
                            unilaterally.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said we may do something on food, with [<hi rend="italic"
                                >which?</hi>] <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said was, of
                            course, an entirely different matter. The <gloss target="#t_Secy1"
                                >Secy</gloss> said if we did something on food, <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would not feel we were going beyond our
                            competence in doing this and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said
                            this is entirely different. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said one
                            thing we might think about if we really do it is addressing our
                            announcement on it to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary
                            said we could work in conjunction with <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>, and said actually the question of food has only come from
                            our Ambassador and that we have no word from the Congo Government.
                                <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said it might also be helpful
                            if it were decided to do this if the food were made available in
                            Leopoldville to <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> distribution. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said that might be a very good thing but he would like
                            to think about it a little. The Secretary said it was his feeling it
                            would be very much better to do this through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said his first
                            reaction is that it is a very good idea, but said he would like to give
                            it a little thought. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> suggested if
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> were talking to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> he might sound him out on this
                            and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he would.</p>

                            to Congo under purely US auspices. We have however taken matter up with
                            UNSYG who has it under consideration. We understand problem and will do
                            all we can to help in framework of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We
                            have doubts however of advisability of sending in US troops for many
                            reasons principally among them being the question of language and color.
                            We also feel it would be inadvisable to send the two companies of the
                            24th Infantry to Brazzaville on a standby basis. End message.</p>

                                >SYG</gloss> has been in touch with the Belgian and Soviet

                            said the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> plans to announce this
                            afternoon that he is calling a formal meeting of the Security Council
                            tonight to consider this matter, and the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> plans to say that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            was taking responsibility for the maintenance of order in the Congo but
                            the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is apparently going to ignore
                            the part indicating they want the troops to act against Belgian
                            aggression. The Secretary said the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            hopes to do something like Suez of getting <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops in to restore order and letting the Belgians
                            phase out. The Secretary then read to the President the text of the
                            latest telegram reporting on the deteriorating situation.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot
                                Lodge</persName> a couple of times and <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> will report after the luncheon. The Secretary said
                            in the meanwhile the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has offers of
                            troops from Tunisia of one battalion, 300 from Ghana, and is hopeful of
                            troops of Senegalese, Sudan and Yugoslavia, but <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> has to get vote by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.
                            The President asked if the Soviets won’t veto this in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, and the Secretary said that was a real
                            question; that in view of the fact that the offers have come from
                            African States, the Soviets may hesitate to veto, but if they do veto we
                            will have to take really serious look at the entire situation. The
                            Secretary <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0331"/>said it would really
                            be the beginning of something serious if the Chinese Communists were
                            called in by the Congo.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4">

                            during the course of the afternoon. The Secretary said the Soviet
                            representative in New York refused to attend the informal meeting of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members if it were held in the
                            regular conference room, which was the reason the <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is having a luncheon meeting. The
                            Secretary said the Belgians had asked the French to assist them to stave
                            off a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting, but things have been
                            developing rapidly since then.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why Hammarskjold doesn’t consider this an emergency
                            and just accept the troop offers and himself go there and take charge.
                            The Secretary said that is essentially what the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> wants to do, but in terms of money for financing this
                            he has to have a vote from a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organ.
                            The President said, on the other hand, in the case of an emergency we
                            and the British and French could guarantee expenses up to a given
                            amount. The Secretary said we did that before but it led to
                            complications because it was on a voluntary contribution basis and if
                            the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> can do it without delay out of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> funds it is better.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if it would be all right if he called the Secretary
                            about 6:00 this evening and the Secretary said he thought that would be
                            fine since we should have better information by that time. The President
                            asked if we have anybody of our own to evacuate from the Congo and the
                            Secretary said we are in pretty good shape except for some missionaries
                            scattered in areas where there is no way of getting in a plane or
                            helicopter. The President said he thought some of the Africans foresaw
                            this. The Secretary said the African Ambassadors at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had a meeting at the end of June with
                            Hammarskjold before Congo independence but the trouble they foresaw was
                            not with the Belgians but in terms of inter-tribal fights.</p>
                        <p>On food for the Congo, the President said we could get three or four
                            C–130’s and move this in. The Secretary said we are moving food from

                            <persName corresp="#p_DJHJ1">Douglas</persName> and Adm. <persName

                            airlift if we are asked to. The President then said with regard to
                            reimbursement that in the interests of speed we might keep this question
                            of reimbursement until after the action rather than have the <gloss

                            do it and then we could put in our claim for reimbursement afterward.
                            The Secretary said this was what we had done before and there had been
                            some complications since the contributions were voluntary. The Secretary
                            said the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> himself would prefer to
                            have this come out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Fund and
                            then apportion the cost later. The President said the instructions are
                            all right then.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Cabot

                            he can get the Tunisians to introduce this sort of resolution. The
                            President referred to all the ticker reports saying the Soviets are
                            alleging the US is really the culprit in this plane incident<note n="3"

                                was in Soviet air space.</note> and the President said he is glad
                            they have done this because it shows the venom of their attitude. The
                            President said he doesn’t see why somebody doesn’t point to Poland,
                            Hungary and Czechoslovakia, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought the Secretary was doing exactly right.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he didn’t think he would be hearing anything tonight.

                        <p>33. Re <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Meeting on Congo. Following are
                            principal elements our approach on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            consideration of Congo which are sent to you for guidance.</p>
                        <p>1. We are in agreement with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s plan to
                            seek establishment on urgent basis of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            force for Congo drawn from smaller <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members.</p>
                        <p>2. Overall approach is for US not to take lead on this matter, but at
                            same time to give every feasible support to <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> to establish <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force in
                            Congo. If so requested by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, US
                            prepared to assist by means of transport, communications and other
                            logistic support as in cases <gloss target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_UNOGIL1">UNOGIL</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> may wish down play US involvement for obvious reasons
                            and if this case, we understand it fully. We anxious that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence be established quickly. We
                            believe that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> failure could mean
                            intervention Bandung powers (Chinese Communists) consequence of which
                            would be most serious. Importance earliest arrival of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel stressed by both US Ambassador
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> in Leopoldville. This
                            connection, we prepared air-lift Tunisian or other personnel if <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> desires.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree fully with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s intention to
                            avoid recrimination and criticism re Belgian actions and his desire to
                            formulate terms of reference describing mission of force in terms other
                            than those in Congolese request. Belgians obviously have not committed
                            aggression and US could not support any <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> force on this basis. Given the inability of Congolese
                            Government to maintain law and order, Belgian actions to protect lives
                            and property and to assist and evacuate own citizens are clearly
                            justified.</p>
                        <p>4. We agree with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> concept of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force: (a) that its purpose is to take
                            over peace and security function; and (b) that it establish bridge for
                            and provide basis for withdrawal of Belgian forces once <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence effectively established.</p>
                        <p>5. Obviously, we are strongly opposed to Soviet bloc states providing any
                            troops, and we know that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> fully
                            cognizant this point. We can appreciate <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> desire bring in some Yugoslavs, as he did in <gloss
                                target="#t_UNEF1">UNEF</gloss> in order neutralize Soviets in this
                            regard. This is acceptable to us provided proportion of Yugoslav troops
                            kept to reasonable number and they not be given overall command, when
                            such is established by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>6. Re Council action, we believe res. along following lines might be
                            desirable. We are indicating res. below only as illustrative and suggest
                            approach in it be passed to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> undoubtedly will have his own ideas
                            both as to contents and sponsorship. We believe Tunisian and possibly
                            Ceylonese sponsorship is best. We would not ourselves wish sponsor so
                            that it will enhance chances that res. will get through <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> without Soviet veto. To extent to which
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is responding to African desires
                            and appeal possibility of res. passing is enhanced. However, we would be
                            opposed to including anything in the res. which is recriminatory toward
                            Belgium.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> had urged Loridan make

                            of troops which would set stage, in his opinion, for Congo request that
                            Belgium quit various bases, including one at Kamina. In elaborating this
                            point, Loridan said this was <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            and, in emotional tone, tried to convey impression US was seeking cut
                            Belgium off and out from Congo entirely, and injuring <gloss

                            agitation and allegations, which were basically addressed to avoiding

                            on Belgians to withdraw, if necessary to obtain result tonight,
                            Secretary felt <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should go

                            from the Belgian Government saying they will pay for all the food. The
                            Secretary said in the meantime we have had an official <gloss

                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> who then becomes the responsible
                            party for its distribution. The Secretary said it was a question of who
                            receives the food and who is responsible for it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said he agreed but hoped there
                            would be no delay. <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said
                            he understood from a tactical point of view that <gloss

                            Secretary said the nearest food is in Lome and the other in Germany. The
                            Secretary said we thought we had the necessary airlift from Lome but
                            there have been some hitches but that everybody is at work on this right
                            now and we are hoping we will have it all cleared within a couple of

                            thinks it is better now not to get into a wrangle over who pays and it
                            is better to do it under our own disaster relief thing.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> asked if the <gloss

                            abstained on the resolution last night. The <gloss target="#t_Secy1"
                                >Secy</gloss> said they abstained because of the phrase asking for
                            Belgian withdrawal but made it clear in their speeches they were in
                            favor of this whole thing. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> made it clear in a

                            late to get this reference out of the resolution. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said he talked to <persName

                            they will pull out. The <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said he
                            thought it has ended up fairly amicably and <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1"
                                >Burden</persName> said much more so than he had thought
                            possible.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said there is also a

                                corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said we may have to fly it all

                            going to be a problem flying in drums of fuel. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said maybe we can get it off
                            the Wasp, but the <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said the Wasp
                            will not be there until the 20th. <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1"
                                >Burden</persName> said he apparently had wrong information and
                            thought the Wasp arrived Saturday. <note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">July

                            <persName corresp="#p_BWAM1">Burden</persName> said another thing is
                            light aircraft to lift out missionaries; that helicopters didn’t have
                            enough range. <gloss target="#t_Secy1">Secy</gloss> said he didn’t know
                            what type but there are light aircraft on the Wasp. Burden said the food
                            thing really is the most important, and the <gloss target="#t_Secy1"
                                >Secy</gloss> said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, resuming his briefing, pointed out that

                            arrived. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was unwilling to
                            accept this kind of Belgian withdrawal. Another problem in the Congo was
                            the failure of many Congolese recently to receive their salaries from
                            the Belgian firms for which they worked. In addition, there were spotty

                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> Government continued to
                            be characterized by ineptitude. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was especially anti-Western; his Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, however, was not. In a message to the <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> had stated that the Congo had
                            requested UN assistance, not to re-establish order, but to protect the
                            Congo against Belgium. Other messages had disavowed the request by the
                            Foreign Minister for U.S. aid. An envoy from Katanga, which had seceded
                            from the Congo,<note n="4" xml:id="d126fn4">On July 11.</note> was on

                            case. The secession of Katanga had placed the Belgians in a difficult
                            position. The Belgian Government had recognized the Congo and was
                            opposed to its fragmentation. However, it also wants to protect its
                            large investment in Katanga which contains the largest Belgian
                            investments.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> stated that the
                            Belgian Government was split on the question of independence for
                            Katanga. Seven Cabinet Ministers favor Katanga’s secession. The
                            provincial governor in Katanga, who is <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311"
                                facs="0341"/>pro-Belgian, is on his way to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In actuality, the Belgians would like
                            secession as a means of better preserving their investment in this
                            richest of the Congo provinces, but they were still maintaining an
                            official position that the integrity of the Congo must be preserved. The
                            Belgian Consul in Elisabethville had been working strongly for
                            secession. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> felt
                            that it was understating the matter to say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was anti-West.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> then went on to
                            point out that an interesting aspect of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action on the Congo had gone largely unnoticed because
                            it occurred too late to appear in the morning newspapers. The Russians
                            had offered three amendments to the Tunisian resolution on the Congo.
                            The first had called for immediate withdrawal of the Belgians. It had
                            been defeated. The Secretary-General favored a phased withdrawal of the
                            Belgian forces despite the unfortunate statement of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Resolution called for immediate withdrawal.<note n="6"

                                Central Files, 770G.00/7–1460)</note> In this connection, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that “withdrawal” was being
                            used in two different senses—from the country and to barracks within the
                            Congo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> then
                            went on to state that additional Soviet amendments providing that
                            nothing but African troops should be used and condemning the Belgians
                            had also been defeated. On the whole, the Belgians were reasonably
                            satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that there was
                            a divided situation in the Congo Government. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had moved to Stanleyville but the Cabinet was
                            still in Leopoldville. Whether the Cabinet would move to Stanleyville
                            was not clear. The rest of the Cabinet, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> indicated, was more reasonable
                            than <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. In answer to an
                            inquiry by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName>,
                            Mr. Amory indicated that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            was 34 years old. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had assumed the position of Minister of Defense.
                            The Secretary indicated his amazement at the speed with which the U.S.
                            lift for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force had been organized.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJHJ1">Douglas</persName> confirmed that
                            the first aircraft would arrive in the Congo that afternoon. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> inquired how many
                            planes were involved in the lift. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJHJ1"
                                >Douglas</persName> replied that almost fifty had been committed and
                            about the same number would be used for re-support. In this connection,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> pointed out that
                            in order to handle the turn-around of U.S. aircraft, we would need to
                            get one officer and 25 men into Brazzaville. He said that he <pb n="312"
                                xml:id="pg_312" facs="0342"/>was afraid that if we did not get our
                            own people into the area, the lift operation might bog down. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> thought there would
                            not be too much trouble about arranging this. He went on to point out
                            that communications up the Congo River had been disrupted because Matadi
                            was held by the rebels. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                                >Twining</persName> also noted that special communications equipment
                            had been requested by the U.S. Embassy and had been sent in by the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> inquired as to
                            what we would do if the independence of Katanga became an issue—for
                            example, could <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces be used in
                            Katanga? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            acknowledged that this would pose a difficult problem. He pointed out
                            that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had attempted to go
                            to Elisabethville but that the provincial governor had kept him out and
                            that instead he had gone to Luluaburg. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3"
                                >Stans</persName> inquired as to the possibility of uniting Kivu
                            with Katanga. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            noted that in the Katanga there was a split situation. Some of the
                            people were pro-Belgian and some were anti-Belgian.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> suggested that the present
                            situation raised a question as to existing policy. Although that policy
                            contains an escape clause, it provides in general that the U.S. should
                            reply upon the former metro-pole. <note n="7" xml:id="d126fn7">Reference

                        <p>I also endeavored line up further Congolese support for Federation in

                            as they left plane and gave message. The reception was polite but
                            frigid—both <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0344"/>men being under

                            had to find them transportation which was not laid on.</p>
                        <p>As they decended plane ramp Belgian troops and civilians booed and called
                            them “macaque”, about the worst possible, violently until they finally
                            got away. Parenthetically, Belgian troops and civilians are behaving
                            similarly and worse in Leopoldville streets. One Congolese civilian was
                            killed by white civilian on street near Meling Hotel this morning
                            without any provocation.</p>

                            instructed to make was that it was now clear that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was operating under Soviet
                            guidance. The Secretary said we had remarked at the change in his
                            attitude prior to his recent trip when he was refused landing facilities
                            in Elizabethville and his attitude thereafter. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> said that these changes of
                            attitude had occurred before and noted his very disagreeable speech in
                            front of the King of Belgium at the time of independence and his very
                            friendly statement a few hours thereafter.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3"

                                vol. I, pp. 323–326.</note> He said that since their return to
                            Leopoldville <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had avoided Belgian
                            representatives there. He said that, furthermore, they were not
                            consulting with the Foreign Minister who was taking quite a different
                            line.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> continued
                            saying that the Soviet hand in <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s activities was becoming clearer and clearer.
                            He noted the threatening statement of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> to the effect that the Soviets would take
                            further steps if the Belgians did not cease their present activities in
                            the Congo. He said that this could even lead to armed Soviet
                            intervention. He then handed the Secretary the text of a telegram from
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. He said the Foreign
                            Minister had asked him to give this text to the Secretary. He said that
                            now that we had one statement from the Soviets on this subject they
                            would probably continue their menaces and might indeed take further
                            actions. In the light of this situation, the Belgian Government thought
                            that perhaps the time had now come for the United States to make a
                            statement with regard to the Soviet menace in the Congo, along the lines
                            that they would have to face the U.S. should they intervene in the
                            Congo. He said the Foreign Minister felt personally that there should be
                            such a statement at the present time. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> continued saying that the
                            situation in the Congo could even lead to World War III. He noted that
                            the first U.N. groups have begun to arrive today and that this might
                            ameliorate the situation. However, he continued that if the Soviet
                            statement on their intentions with regard to the Congo were not
                            counteracted by any U.S. reply, this would mark a net gain for the
                            Soviets throughout Africa. He said the Belgian Government was extremely
                            worried by this development.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concurred that this was a serious situation. He wondered
                            how physically the Soviets would move if they were to accept a possible
                            invitation for intervention from the Congolese. He noted it would be a
                            difficult and lengthy move by air and that if the <pb n="316"
                                xml:id="pg_316" facs="0346"/>Soviets were to move by sea, the U.S.
                            carrier would be off the Congo coast before the Soviets could be there.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> noted that
                            the Soviets seem to feel that they were the protectors of the Congo. The
                            Secretary recommended strongly that the message which <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> had directed be given to him
                            should also be given urgently to Hammarskjold. He said that the U.N.
                            Secretary-General had taken hold of the situation quite firmly and he
                            thought it would make him extremely angry that one country, i.e., the
                            Soviets were intervening in this situation. The Secretary noted that the
                            Secretary-General interpreted the UNSC resolution in the same fashion
                            that we do, i.e., that there should be no Belgian withdrawal from the
                            Congo until the U.N. force was firmly in control.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired how Soviet technicians would be introduced
                            into the Congo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1"
                                >Scheyven</persName> said doubtless by air and noted that there were
                            many airfields in the Congo, though the two bases of Kamina and Kitona
                            were fortunately firmly in Belgian hands. He continued, saying that the
                            task of the U.N. force would be enormous and that he hoped that they
                            would initially concentrate on areas where there was widespread
                            lawlessness and not on those regions which the Belgian troops controlled
                            and where they had reestablished order. If the U.N. units attempted to
                            force the Belgians to withdraw from areas where they were in control the
                            effect would be very bad. He said that if law and order were not
                            re-established promptly in the Congo the entire structure of the
                            country, both Belgian and Congolese, would collapse.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> then discussed
                            the situation in Katanga. He said that obviously the Katanga government
                            had not taken all of the necessary juridical steps to make its position
                            clear. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> said
                            that it was not the present intention of the Belgian Government to
                            recognize the Tshombe regime, but that the Belgians feared that this
                            might soon be the only part of the Congo which was connected with the
                            Free World. Therefore, the Belgians hoped we would not press hard
                            against the present Katanga regime. He said that Tshombe was planning to
                            present his case to the United Nations one way or another and he
                            believed that this Katanga movement should not be suppressed at too
                            early a stage as it might be the last stronghold we have. Furthermore,
                            it was economically, of course, the most important part of the Congo.
                            Finally, if the rest of the country fell under Moscow domination, we
                            might wish to reconsider our present attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired if the relationship between <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was still close. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> thought that they distrusted
                            each other and therefore were sticking close together to watch each
                            other. He reverted to his suggestion that the United States Government
                            should make a statement with regard to the Congo along <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0347"/>the lines outlined above, i.e., in the
                            nature of a warning to the Soviets regarding moving into the area. The
                            Secretary said we would give consideration to the matter, but that was
                            all he could say now.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">Telegram 148 to

                            concluded, noting that the first responsibility in the affair rested
                            with the U.N. If the U.N. failed to meet this responsibility, then

                        <p>125. For the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>.
                            We face immediately ahead the need to make a major policy decision which
                            is complex, full of imponderables and charged with fateful portent not
                            only for the Congo but for Africa. It is intimately, if unhappily a part
                            of the great-power struggle.</p>
                        <p>The Congo may be in its death throes as a modern nation. The Congo itself
                            was never such a nation and no Congolese has any real comprehension of
                            what makes such a nation live. They consequently do not understand that
                            it may be dying. The 100,000 Europeans were the ones who did know but
                            they never managed to communicate either their knowledge or their higher
                            skills to enough Congolese to make any significant difference.</p>
                        <p>The flood of refugees now going and gone will reduce the European
                            population to something nearer 10,000 if the worst fears of some
                            non-Belgian observers are realized. The brutal fact is that this great
                            and expensive infrastructure faces potential deterioration which cannot
                            yet be predicted but might well become almost total. The next <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0349"/>operation is strictly salvage.
                            There must be an identification of what is vital, and it will be an
                            Herculean task to save that. The less vital cannot be saved.</p>
                        <p>The present government and any that is foreseeable, has not the slightest
                            idea of what is happening let alone what might be done about it. That
                            has been clearly established by all who are on the scene. It does not,
                            consequently, even know what it should ask for.</p>
                        <p>It is violently anti-Belgian. As an example of the latter and the former,
                            members of the Congolese Cabinet are doing everything they can to
                            convince the government that all Belgian money must be burned because it
                            is Belgian. This is fact not fiction. Some Belgians on the other hand,
                            particularly the military, have become completely irrational and in many
                            instances have behaved worse than the worst Congolese.</p>
                        <p>No one Western country in its right mind would ever undertake the task of
                            rehabilitation here nor could it possibly do it. The best we can most
                            optimistically expect from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort
                            will be only the saving of the most essential—and the inevitable
                            inability of any one to maintain present standards will soon make even
                            that unpopular.</p>
                        <p>There is just an outside chance that after the present tide of panic has
                            run out, there will be a backflow of enough Belgians to reduce the task
                            to more manageable proportions. This will depend first upon the firm
                            establishment of law and order not just temporarily but for the long
                            pull. Second, it will be aided by the fact that jobs have been scarce in
                            Belgium and will be even scarcer for those who have just gone and are
                            now going. Third, it will require the re-establishment of some
                            satisfactory rapport between the Congolese and the Belgians.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe the problems and the prospects are or could be at this
                            time appreciated in Washington, London or Paris. They might be in part
                            in Brussels. Now that this first phase of simple survival and security
                            in Leopoldville is ending, I strongly urge that I be ordered home on two

                            problem as I see it before we are faced with a decision which seems to
                            me will resolve into one of the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Go along with present <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plans and
                            programs which will barely, if that, maintain order in the principal
                            centers of population and will not touch the problem of preserving the
                            infrastructure, particularly in the public and private sectors in the
                            interior.</p>
                        <p>2. Urge and support an enormously greater economic plan which might
                            preserve more of the infrastructure but cost many hundreds of millions
                            of dollars and extend over years.</p>
                        <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0350"/>
                        <p>3. Permit the Katanga, which is viable and has emerged so far practically
                            unscathed, to become independent and face the fragmentation of the
                            country which might well continue.</p>
                        <p>I think I now know enough to be helpful in discussions in Washington. I
                            think it is of the utmost importance to understand the flavor of what is
                            happening not just the bald historic facts.</p>
                        <p>I can perhaps illustrate by saying this is comparable with the problem
                            faced in Germany after the war and at the same time the opposite. In
                            Germany, we had to replace the infrastructure which could and was
                            operable by the people; here we have the infrastructure but the
                            operators are evaporating.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> concerned with danger that request
                            for assistance from <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> sent
                            out in all directions might result in attempts by Soviet bloc to move in
                            with technicians. He believes most effective means prevent this is for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move in as quickly as possible to
                            prevent any vacuum developing as Belgians move out. He has therefore
                            requested specialized agencies urgently to begin planning to supply
                            technical assistance as soon as political situation stabilizes enough
                            for them to be used. He observed this is first time <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has had to assist country where it had no
                            government and whole <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> program is going
                            ahead without Govt of Congo approval in any clear-cut form. (<gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> did not seem daunted by that and in
                            fact appears intrigued by creative role thrust upon <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He nevertheless carefully protects
                            himself by consultations with other Africans, and, in differing degrees,
                            with big powers.)</p>
                        <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said his approach in requesting
                            troops had been first to issue general request for battalions to all
                            independent African states (except, of course, South Africa). He said in
                            reality he hoped avoid taking either Mali or Guinea forces at outset. He
                            did not want Guinean troops for obvious reasons and if he took troops
                            from Mali, he felt in politics of Africa he would have to take Guinean
                            troops. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> therefore relieved when Mali
                            replied they could not supply troops before July 21 because of army
                            reorganization now in progress. This, <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> felt, strengthened his hand in telling Sekou Toure he
                            did not need Guinean troops since he already had as many as he could
                            handle now, but he did need specialists, and therefore would like police
                            company. (While <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s reply to Guinea
                            still being processed, he received formal Guinean offer of 2 battalions.
                            However, he ordered his original reply to be sent as if formal offer had
                            not come to his attention in time.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he felt it imperative that he
                            make clear to independent African states he considered they had main
                            responsibility for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s effort in Congo.
                            In his view, this will stop in advance any argument that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation is disguised imperialism. At
                            same time <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he is emphasizing to
                            Africans that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation must have
                            “universal” character and for that reason in his “second phase” (<gloss

                            problem of Katanga until “middle of week” by which time he believes
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will be in strong position in rest
                            of Congo. He then intends to send emissary (not going through
                            Leopoldville) to Tshombe to make arrangements for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops to go into Katanga. His general tactic will be
                            that he will deal directly with Tshombe and by implication recognize his
                            importance and at same time trade that recognition for permission have
                            troops enter Katanga. Once <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            successfully in Katanga, Tshombe’s efforts secede likely lose their

                            ultimatum and does not accept ultimatums.</p>
                        <p>Alexander told us situation in Stanleyville tense but Force Publique has
                            so far limited itself to roughing up Europeans and no known serious
                            injuries or outrages in Orientale. In conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> some time after arriving in
                            Stanleyville Alexander said former demanded all Belgian troops be out by
                            Monday or could not vouch for actions of Force Publique. Alexander told
                            him that was physically impossible. Following meeting Lumbala, Chef
                            d’Etat of the Presidency, told Alexander <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> was involved in imperialism and intentionally delaying
                            sending in troops. After an hour <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> handed Alexander letter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>. They decided remain
                            Stanleyville and Alexander is sending transportation for them today.</p>
                        <p>Alexander feels <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> not happy
                            with direction being taken by <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> but seems to be weak and under latter’s thumb.
                            Alexander feels <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is
                            irrational and so does <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>. I
                            think at very least we are dealing with man who is temporarily
                            irrational.</p>
                        <p>I talked at length with <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>
                            and Kanza who said they would call Cabinet meeting to be held on arrival
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName

                            ultimatum. <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> considers it
                            illegal since it has neither Cabinet nor Parliamentary approval.</p>

                        <p>126. Re: Congo. In conversation this afternoon with me, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> (Tunisia):</p>
                        <p>1. Urgently requested US insist that Belgians announce they are
                            withdrawing their troops from Congo, at least on one-to-one basis as
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops arrive.</p>
                        <p>2. He urged that I make statement in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> at
                            Congo <gloss target="#t_mtg1">mtg</gloss> that Belgian forces should be
                            withdrawn speedily now that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops are
                            arriving. He assumed I would not be able call for their withdrawal by a
                            certain date.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> said Congo Deputy FonMin
                            will be in New York Wednesday afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_SM8"
                                >Slim</persName> told Sobolev he was therefore requesting <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_mtg1">mtg</gloss>, now scheduled Tuesday<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d133fn1">July 19.</note> afternoon at Soviet request, be put
                            off until Wednesday afternoon. <persName corresp="#p_SM8"
                                >Slim</persName> said he asked Sobolev if Soviets intend send troops
                            to Congo; Sobolev replied they would not send troops. Soviet objective
                            is to establish date by which Belgian troops will have been
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> urged that we not let
                            Soviets take initiative. He realized we cannot go as far as Soviets
                            demanding Belgian withdrawal by specific date, but believes we should
                            openly favor speedy withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> said he was very
                            discouraged by continued rumors of new arrivals in Congo of Belgian
                            troops. He said Congo is weakest area in Africa and it clear Soviets are
                            concentrating on it. He urged we take above action soonest.</p>
                        <p>6. Believe our strategy of backing <persName corresp="#p_SM8"
                                >Slim</persName> has proved its prudence thus far. If we had not
                            supported him last Wednesday there would undoubtedly have been Soviet
                            veto and situation in Congo would be worse than it is. Recommend I be
                            authorized to support his request and keep initiative in matter of so
                            much meaning to Africa out of Soviet hands. Am confident too that speedy
                            Belgian withdrawal is also in best interests of Belgians.</p>

                        <p>M. Gutt thanked the Secretary for receiving him and said that he was here
                            originally in connection with private business matters. However, he knew
                            the Congo question would be raised with him so he had seen Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> before leaving
                            Brussels. He said that M. Wigny had asked him to explain to the
                            Secretary and to Mr. Hammarskjold the position of the Belgian Government
                            on the Congo crisis. He said M. Wigny had also asked him to discuss this
                            at length with the Belgian Ambassadors in New York and here. He said he
                            could sum up M. Wigny’s views on repercussions of the Congo situation in
                            Belgium under three headings: first, the sentimental reaction in
                            Belgium; second, the political reaction; and third, the military
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the first factor M. Gutt said that everyone in Belgium
                            from the King down was indignant regarding the shocking atrocities which
                            had been committed by the Congolese. He said the reaction in Belgium was
                            one of astonishment that the whole world did not share Belgium’s
                            indignation. He said the Belgian attitude on the entire question could
                            be explained by the profound reaction against the events which had taken
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Passing to the political repercussions M. Gutt said that whether or not
                            the Soviets in fact prepared the disturbances in the Congo, they have
                            exploited them extremely cleverly since they broke out. Soviet policy
                            here was the same as everywhere, an effort to divide the West. Following
                            the recent mutiny the Congolese Force Publique apparently was being
                            Sovietized. The Soviet policy, which was being carried out by the Force
                            Publique, was to create an atmosphere of fear and violence which would
                            empty the Congo of its needed technicians and create a vacuum for the
                            Soviets to move into. M. Gutt said that the present crisis far
                            transcends a dispute between Belgium and the <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326"
                                facs="0356"/>Congo. This was in fact a crucial test between the
                            Soviets and the West like the Korean crisis had been in its day. He said
                            that Belgium was very much concerned and realized what was at stake.
                            Central Africa had become an East-West battleground and the Belgian
                            Government and people trusted that the United States would react as
                            firmly as in the case of Korea.</p>
                        <p>M. Gutt touched briefly on the military aspects of the Congo crisis and
                            then said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> hoped that there would be a U.S. declaration which
                            would serve as a deterrent to the Soviets and would be in effect a hands
                            off declaration covering Central Africa. M. Gutt said he did not know
                            precisely how M. Wigny envisaged such a statement being made or how we
                            would implement it but he thought that it was essential that the Soviets
                            be made aware of the firm U.S. position on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Passing to the situation in New York, M. Gutt said that he hoped when the
                            Congo question came up again in the Security Council, the United States
                            would support the Belgian position. He described the Belgian military
                            presence in the Congo as clearly to protect Belgian civilians. Belgian
                            forces intervened only after the first horrors had been committed. They
                            would clearly stay as long as necessary to restore order. When the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has in fact restored law and
                            order, the Belgian forces would withdraw but until that time it was
                            impossible for them to do so. M. Gutt said he had conveyed the foregoing
                            to Mr. Hammarskjold and Mr. Hammarskjold said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops could clearly not act in
                            collaboration with the Belgian forces since the former received their
                            orders from the United Nations. However, in fact, he said, satisfactory
                            liaison existed. He repeated that the Belgian intervention was only to
                            protect white residents of the Congo.</p>
                        <p>M. Gutt then said that the Belgian position also was to the effect that
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops were there to restore order
                            and therefore they should intervene only where there were disorders and
                            not where peace and quiet already existed as in Katanga. There was a
                            widespread need for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces throughout
                            much of the Congo and therefore it would be unfortunate if they were to
                            intervene in areas where Belgian forces were already assuring
                            tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to have M. Gutt’s views on the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Katanga consisting of
                            one or two <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives. M. Gutt
                            said he had discussed this matter with Mr. Hammarskjold and believed
                            that the Secretary-General did not wish to have <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops in Katanga at the present time. He said
                            Hammarskjold had mentioned to him confidentially this idea of having one
                            or two <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> civilians to constitute a
                            presence in Katanga. He thought that this would be agreeable to the
                            Belgian government.</p>
                        <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0357"/>
                        <p>M. Gutt continued saying he realized that what the Belgians wished us to
                            do was not easy. However, he thought we should give serious
                            consideration to their viewpoint because the external concerns of
                            Belgium and the United States with regard to the Congo were identical
                            and this had now become a focal point in the cold war. The Secretary
                            then discussed <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedures. He said he
                            thought it would be most helpful if the Belgian Government could give
                            further statements of amplification regarding troop withdrawals as order
                            was restored in various parts of the Congo. He thought it would be
                            particularly useful if this could occur in advance of the further <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> discussion of this matter. M. Gutt said
                            that he was sure the Belgian Government would reaffirm its willingness
                            to withdraw forces as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops began to
                            come into the Congo. The Secretary referred to an agreement between Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> and the Belgian
                            Commanding General in the Congo on this subject.<note n="1"

                            Government’s relations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> have been excellent from the beginning.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> noted that
                            certain Belgian units had already been removed from Leopoldville. M.
                            Gutt thought that full implementation of the withdrawal policy could not
                            be achieved at the moment since <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            were too limited thus far.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the action of the Congolese parliament in
                            rejecting the suggestion of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> that there should be an appeal for Soviet
                            assistance. M. Gutt said that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was pinning his actions vis-à-vis the Soviets on
                            alleged failure of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort. M. Gutt
                            said that the Belgians hoped that the African Chiefs of State would call
                            the attention of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to the
                            fact that they had sent their own forces there and that these forces and
                            not the Soviets should restore order in the Congo. He then said that in
                            the Belgian view there was virtually no Congolese Government at the
                            present time and merely two men running around, out of touch with the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he hoped the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            debate tomorrow would proceed satisfactorily. He noted that the
                            Congolese were sending a representative over who was supposed to be a
                            moderate. M. Gutt said that he was one of the few rather good men and
                            was probably in disagreement with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. He said the Congolese Government had never been
                            more than a conglomeration of disparate individuals and that these men
                            were not capable of restoring order.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired as to approximately how many Belgians had
                            left the Congo since the outbreak of disturbances there. The Belgian
                            Ambassador and M. Gutt agreed that there had originally been <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0358"/>some 85,000 in the Congo and that
                            probably there were now about 30 or 35,000 left. The Secretary assured
                            M. Gutt that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            would be prepared to make a strong statement regarding Soviet activities
                            in the Congo. He thought we would be in a relatively good position if
                            the Belgians would indicate their intentions with regard to phased
                            withdrawals of their forces as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            took over. The Secretary also said that we would stress that there
                            should not be introduced into the Congo any troops other than those
                            requested by the United Nations. M. Gutt stressed that the Belgians
                            believe that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops should proceed
                            primarily to areas where there are disorders. The Secretary said that
                            the purpose of sending them indeed was precisely to restore order.</p>

                            was most impressive. He commented on the fact that no combat aircraft
                            are apparently being brought in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> confirmed this, and said that the <gloss

                            carrier Wasp will be lying off shore beginning the same evening. It
                            carries eight helicopters as well as other aircraft. In addition a fleet
                            oiler will reach the Congo at the same time. Besides oil it is carrying

                            the Soviets for a report by the Secretary General on this subject. The
                            President commented that there might be some advantage in moving Belgian
                            troops out of the Congo by our returning airlift. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said the Belgians do not want
                            to leave until the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> provides security.
                            He said they had worked out with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> agreements under which they will use their troops
                            only to protect Belgians from violence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said there had been one very recent untoward and,
                            in fact, dangerous development. There is some evidence the Belgians are
                            supporting the effort of the Katanga Province to achieve independence.
                            He noted that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is supporting the
                            Congo as an entity. He commented that the troops of the other African
                            nations now in the Congo will be enraged if the Katanga Province is made
                            independent, with Belgian collaboration. The President commented that if
                            the Soviets tried to send in combat forces without a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> request, we should try to get
                            Hammarskjold to say that no troops other than those requested by the
                            United Nations will be allowed to come in. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> commented that one measure of
                            control that is being sought by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is
                            to set up a staging area in Nigeria through which all incoming forces
                            would have to pass. The President said he was concerned that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was getting into something that it could
                            not bring to a conclusion, and asked where this operation would end in
                            terms of the running <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0360"/>of the

                            Embassy views based on numerous discussions with Belgians. Specific
                            suggestions may be rapidly overtaken by fast-moving developments, but
                            Embassy believes situation calls for urgent measures on various levels

                        <p>1. Whatever circumstances and motivations may have led to present
                            situation, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has now
                            maneuvered himself into position of opposition to West, resistance to

                            Congolese supporters (Kashamura,<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">Minister of

                            ends. Only prudent, therefore, to plan on basis that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> government threatens our vital
                            interests in Congo and Africa generally. A principal objective of our
                            political and diplomatic action must therefore be to destroy <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> government as now constituted,
                            but at same time we must find or develop another horse to back which
                            would be acceptable in rest of Africa and defensible against Soviet
                            political attack.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s present strength
                            (which may now be at lowest ebb) depends on:</p>
                        <p>(A) His “legitimacy” in eyes Congo and rest of Africa as duly appointed
                            Prime Minister-</p>
                        <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0361"/>
                        <p>(B) His adroitness as a politician and propagandist, reinforced by
                            Kashamura’s control of Congolese Radio;</p>
                        <p>(C) His apparent dominance over Congolese Chamber (but not Senate) which
                            helps protect him from legal coup d’etat; and</p>
                        <p>(D) Fact <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has gone along
                            with him and may really share his present viewpoint, especially because
                            of presence Belgian troops.</p>
                        <p>His principal weakness is absence any instrument or structure through
                            which to exercise power. Elimination Force Publique as effective
                            instrument and massive departure White administrators serves Communist
                            purposes, but from <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            viewpoint these facts make it extremely difficult to establish his
                            authority outside range his oratory.</p>
                        <p>3. Political action in support objective paragraph 1 must be internal and
                            external, and might include following courses of action among
                            others:</p>
                        <p>(A) Desirable that with minimum United States direct action, public image
                            be created among politicians and people of Congo and leaders and
                            populations of independent African states that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is witting or unwitting
                            instrument of Soviet intervention in Central Africa, and will thus bring
                            to Africa a new and worse form of White imperialism.</p>
                        <p>(B) Most immediate hope of dropping <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> would of course reside in his repudiation by
                            Congolese Parliament which would eliminate his constitutional
                            “legitimacy” and permit him retain power only by open coup d’etat for
                            which he may not have necessary naked force, especially in Leopoldville.
                            Cannot judge from here whether someone now attempting such a maneuver or
                            its chances of success, although appears Ileo is attempting to move
                            Senate in that direction.</p>
                        <p>(C) Alternative or perhaps simultaneous approach would be seek to build
                            up provincial governments as de facto authority, attempt have them adopt
                            position of “no confidence” toward central government which would weaken
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in face his political
                            enemies, and then build back toward some central authority exclusive of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Problem of Katanga is
                            of course related and Embassy feels it should be dealt with within this
                            conceptual framework of dealing with “de facto” provincial authority. We
                            should not discourage Tshombe from building any relationship he can with
                            other provinces leading toward “confederation”, but should continue for
                            now to discourage Katanga legal “independence” and any recognition of it
                            in the international field.</p>
                        <p>(D) Parallel to internal action, United States and others should point
                            out privately as appropriate to leaders neutral countries, especially
                            African, fact <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is serving
                            Soviet ends as suggested above. In individual African countries point
                            could be made that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> appears
                            be instrument which will bring Soviet bloc fully into “their continent”,
                            thus defeating dream of <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            and others for creation of neutral pan-African bloc and causing
                            inevitable clash of East and West on African continent which all have
                            sought to prevent. For this purpose important persuade United Nations
                            authorities and representatives see situation in Congo as we do,
                            remembering that <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0362"/>Security

                            circumstances at time. Continue hope, however, that once removed from

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> might well prove to
                            be rallying point for more moderate and constructive elements. Our focus
                            might well be directed at encouraging and strengthening constructive
                            individual leaders and provincial governments and authorities without
                            recognizing independent status of any, at least for time being, in hope
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> might eventually
                            develop into centripetal force based on common interests of all
                            provinces. As President, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> replied U.S. agreed in
                            general and was opposed to precipitate withdrawal of Belgian forces
                            before U.N. troops are in place. However we believed it would be helpful
                            if there could at least be some symbolic withdrawal before <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Meeting. As regards bases Merchant
                            pointed out situation highly confused since Belgian-Congolese Treaty
                            never ratified.<note n="1" xml:id="d137fn1">Reference is to a Treaty of
                                Friendship signed at Léopoldville, June 29, 1960; for text, see <hi
                                    rend="italic">Congo 1960,</hi> vol. I, pp. 313–314.</note> He
                            agreed however without prejudice to eventual settlement fate of bases,
                            withdrawal of Belgian troops to them would be a logical first step. On
                            Katanga Merchant said he felt we were in general but not complete
                            agreement with French since consistent U.S. position has been to support
                            unity of Congo. We had therefore replied to Tshombe’s request for
                            recognition that it was out of question now though we had not closed
                            door. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he believed
                            it would be great mistake if anyone should recognize Katanga now. He
                            believed for time being emissary suggested by Hammarskjold should be
                            sufficient to establish U.N. presence in Katanga but U.S. does not wish
                            to prejudge now question of entry of U.N. forces. He <pb n="334"
                                xml:id="pg_334" facs="0364"/>said we could visualize situation where
                            such entry might be useful since strange situation might be created with
                            U.N. successful in establishing order in five provinces, with sixth
                            remaining policed exclusively by Belgians in absence of United

                            <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> emphasized Belgians did

                            not urgent problem at moment.</p>

                            mutiny could be plot establish Soviet presence Central Africa, making
                            tripartite consultation as well as consultation with Belgians of even
                            greater importance than heretofore. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> replied circumstances suspicious but evidence
                            was not conclusive. French also expressed concern presence Guinean
                            troops in U.N. force, particularly Guinean police who they thought would
                            be agitators, thus creating still another problem. In reply to <persName

                        <p>92. Security Council Meeting on Congo. We assume Soviets will press hard
                            at Security Council meeting tonight for withdrawal of forces within
                            specified time limit (perhaps 72 hours as reported earlier). In view
                            agreement between <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> and
                            Belgians providing for Belgian withdrawal from Leopoldville to its bases
                            by Saturday,<note n="1" xml:id="d138fn1">July 23.</note> we believe
                            Council situation should be manageable. Department of course continues
                            to believe that West would be in even stronger position if Belgians are
                            able to go somewhat further than <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName>–Belgian agreement and state before Council
                            meeting or at an early stage of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            meeting that “withdrawal of Belgian forces out of the Congo has begun”.
                            Alternatively, statement to the effect that “Belgium will begin
                            withdrawal of its forces from the Congo by July 23, assuming the United

                                xml:id="pg_335" facs="0365"/>then”, might be more acceptable to
                            Belgium though clearly not as effective in terms of situation
                            confronting us in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. You requested to
                            continue to point out advantages of making such statement to <persName

                                >UN</gloss> Representative. What we have in mind of course is merely
                            a small token withdrawal from the Congo for symbolic purposes at the
                            moment since we agree fully with <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> assessment that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            is not yet in a position to assure protection both to Africans and
                            Europeans, though it is our hope that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            will be able to do so by end of week, as indicated in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> announcement of yesterday.</p>
                        <p>In foregoing circumstances we would hope that Council proceedings can be
                            concluded without need for any resolution and limited to receipt of
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s report and such statements as
                            Council members may wish to make. We realize, however, that odds are
                            against this sort of a meeting and there is likely to be great deal of
                            pressure for some kind of resolution. If it appears that Soviets will
                            submit resolution calling for immediate withdrawal Belgian forces within
                            72 hours, you may wish consider at your discretion having <gloss

                            and submit resolution along following lines. This resolution would avoid
                            any specific time limit but would provide appropriate basis for phased
                            withdrawal of Belgian forces as rapidly as possible in light of <gloss

                        <p>166. Re: Congo. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> requested
                            appointment with Kanza (Congo) during course of morning July 20. Because
                            of meetings with Afro-Asians and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and
                            lunching with Ghanaians, Kanza had no time to see individual delegates
                            until afternoon. We met with him and his two associates at 2:30 in our
                            small offices in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> welcomed him, informed him
                            our desire he go to Washington for conversations in Dept of State and
                            offered him any possible assistance in our capacity as host govt. Kanza
                            expressed appreciation these offers. He said unfortunately he expected
                            return to Congo at beginning of week and would have remain in <gloss

                            come to State Dept at that time.</p>
                        <p>Kanza is young, serious and intelligent African who impressed us, and
                            others, favorably. He is soft-spoken, mild-mannered and poised. He
                            obviously comprehends fact this is historic moment for his country, full
                            of vital decisions for them to make. He seemed neither daunted nor
                            overwhelmed by this but, rather, confident of capacity his people and
                            their country to face future.</p>
                        <p>Substance of Kanza’s conversation was in essence same as his statement
                            before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> later in evening which is

                            maintain friendly and close relations with Belgium but at same time

                                >SC</gloss> began.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> presented his case to us in
                            fol terms: As Belgium sees it. there are three issues involved. First is
                            conflict over withdrawal of troops. Belgium stands ready to withdraw all
                            its forces of intervention in Congo soon as law and order, etc.
                            re-established. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> prepared
                            state to us their willingness withdraw all Belgian troops. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said, they interpreted
                            establishment of law and order as applying not only to absence of civil
                            disorder but restoration of public services and technical facilities. In
                            this connection <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> expressed
                            concern lest <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> be unable assure such
                            situation and “technicians of Czech nationality and other Communist
                            satellites” flow in at Moscow’s bid to overrun Congo.</p>
                        <p>Second issue for Belgians was question of bases which <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> regarded as important not for
                            Belgium herself but for entire Western world. He said they could serve
                            as bastion of freedom in heart of Africa if they remain in Belgian hands
                            and at disposition of West. In other hands they could be turned against
                            free world. This did not mean Belgium insisted on retaining control of
                            these bases forever. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>
                            referred to provisions of Treaty of Friendship signed June 29 between
                            Congo and Belgium, which provided among other things for <pb n="338"
                                xml:id="pg_338" facs="0368"/>possibility of disposition these bases
                            by turning them over to Congo. However, <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> felt this was matter which could only be dealt
                            with sensibly in fullness of time. Therefore <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces, must not
                            take decisions or actions which would prejudice situation re bases.</p>
                        <p>Third point related to Katanga. Belgian Govt had not changed its position
                            that Katanga was part of Congo. It made no sense to think of Katanga,
                            which had 90 percent of wealth of entire country, as independent with
                            rest of Congo down the drain. Nevertheless in Katanga there was an order
                            of stability and Belgian forces were present there at request of local
                            authorities where they were maintaining law and order. To introduce
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops into Katanga could only
                            cause problem and tend to exaggerate otherwise relatively satisfactory
                            situation. Therefore while not wishing exclude possibility of secession,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said he felt whole issue
                            should be held in suspense, and not prejudged by calling for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops to go there.</p>
                        <p>In response to Lodge’s presentation of views in <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 92, <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said these points were completely consistent with
                            Belgian policy.</p>

                                >USSR</gloss> is apparently attempting to use Egypt as a spearhead
                            in the Congo and in Africa generally. If they manage to do so, it will
                            give them another lever in Africa. The fact that the port of Matadi was
                            now held by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops would be helpful to
                            the general situation in the Congo. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> went
                            on to describe Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            background which he characterized as “harrowing”. In 1956 <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been convicted of embezzling
                            100,000 francs and had received a two-year jail term. There were strong
                            Leftist and Communist trends in his background. He had attended a
                            Communist youth meeting in 1959. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> has clearly been promised assistance by the
                            Communist Party of Belgium. We do not know how much assistance they are
                            giving but it is clear that the Belgian Communist Party is being used as
                            a channel. It is safe to go on the assumption that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has been bought by the
                            Communists; this also, however, fits with his own orientation. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that the first
                            man off the first Soviet plane to arrive in the Congo, which was
                            bringing sugar to the Congo, was a member of a Soviet trade mission.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> asked Secretary <persName

                            anything about the situation in the Congo. In response Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> read off figures as
                            to the numbers and nationality of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces that were being provided for the Congo. The Secretary General had
                            asked for a force of 7500-odd. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            force in the Congo as of six o’clock the night before totalled 3300. By
                            Thursday night<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">July 21.</note> it would
                            total 4485 and the expected grand total would be approximately 11,000.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that his
                            hat was off to the U.S. Air Force for its splendid work in lifting these
                            forces into the Congo so quickly. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> stated that the principal problem was the route
                            problem rather than the lack of aircraft. There were limits to the
                            numbers of aircraft that terminals could take and that a given route
                            could carry. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would like more
                            airlift and if we were satisfied they could use it over the existing
                            route we would provide it. But we might have to delay the airlift
                            somewhat because of route problems. In any event, the military would
                            keep State informed of what it planned to do. Secretary <persName

                        <p>Secretary Mueller<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">Secretary of Commerce
                                Frederick H. Mueller.</note> inquired as to whether all Belgians
                            were being removed. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said that that was the big issue. The Belgians
                            refused to leave their bases in the Congo. They had concluded a treaty
                            with the Congo before independence which had not yet been ratified by
                            either side. It provided for withdrawal of Belgian forces except in two
                            areas. The Belgians are willing to make a phased withdrawal from the
                            rest of the Congo. This whole problem was complicated by the secession
                            of Katanga. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            noted that there was a report that Katanga would unite with Kivu and
                            Ruanda-Urundi. He also noted an item received that morning indicating
                            that some of the Belgian forces were being withdrawn to Ruanda-Urundi
                            which is a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> inquired as to how the
                            cost of the U.S. operation was to be met; whether it would be necessary
                            to ask Congress for supplemental funds for the initial operation and for
                            continuing expenses. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> stated that under the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Participation Act of 1945, the President has broad
                            authority, implementation of which was delegated to the Secretary of
                            State in 1951. The Act provides for automatic reimbursement for expenses
                            incurred in such an operation without special authorization by Congress.
                            The arrangement for the present operation was that the U.S. would
                            contribute the transport and the 400 tons of food. Any additional U.S.
                            expenditures—for example, for helicopters and rations—were on a
                            reimbursable basis. If food were again required in large quantities, we
                            would have to look at the problem. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            had some leeway but a problem existed because Congressionally-approved
                            interim arrangements on funds did not permit the undertaking of new
                            projects. It was the view of the State Department General Counsel,
                            however, that provision of additional food would be a relief activity
                            and that such activities did not constitute new projects. Mr. Staats
                            indicated that this was also the Budget view. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> then inquired as to who would
                            reimburse the U.S. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            would do so and that Hammarskjold had decided to handle the expenses as
                            a regular budget item rather than on a voluntary contribution basis.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> inquired as to
                            whether we had <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0371"/>been reimbursed
                            by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the past. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> assured him that we
                            had operated under the same sort of arrangement in Palestine and that we
                            had been reimbursed at that time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then stated that it was
                            probably not reasonable to suppose that the Soviets would actually send
                            troops to the Congo—even if they had a clear request to do so which they
                            apparently did not have at present. He wondered what we would do,
                            however, if they did send troops. In response Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he would like to obtain
                            the views of the military as to the Soviet logistics problem in any such
                            operation. We refueled our planes now in Rome, Cairo, and Morocco. Their
                            problem, however, would be greater. Also there was the problem of
                            movement in the Congo. Matadi was now in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> hands. Would the Russians lay siege to it? In response
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> stated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had produced a paper dealing
                            with this subject which contained proposed actions to forestall or to
                            impede the introduction of Soviet forces and other actions to deal with
                            the situation if they did get in or are about to get in.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d140fn6">
                                <ref target="#d145">Document 145</ref>.</note> He would like, he
                            said, to send this paper to the State Department. He noted that the
                            Secretary of Defense had not yet approved it however. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> asked how the
                            Russians would get into the Congo. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> said that they would get in by air; this would
                            involve overflights of other African areas. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> asked whether they would refuel
                            in Cairo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> noted
                            that two of the Soviet planes that had already come into the Congo had
                            come non-stop from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> stated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> paper contained proposed courses
                            of action for dealing with different situations; for example, an embargo
                            on arms, a blockade, and action to get other countries to agree not to
                            let the Soviets overfly them. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> inquired
                            whether airfields in the Congo would take the TU–114; if so, the
                            Russians would be able to fly in non-stop. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that there was only one
                            field that could take such aircraft—the field at Leopoldville. But, he
                            said, most of the Soviet equipment for carrying troops consisted of
                            small, short-range aircraft. They would therefore be subject to route
                            and range limitations. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1"
                                >Twining</persName> then described a possible Soviet routing from
                            Odessa via, among other stops, Khartoum and Stanleyville. He concluded
                            by stating that we should look at this problem now in order to see if
                            there were not things which should be done in advance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> then referred to
                            the meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                            the night before and stated that we hoped that there would be no
                            resolution other than one which would simply accept the Secretary
                            General’s report. The Russians had called the meeting to hear the
                            Secretary General’s report, but either they or the Tunisians would file
                            a resolution requesting immediate Belgian withdrawal. We favor <pb
                                n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0372"/>phased withdrawal but there
                            were two sticky points. One was the matter of the Belgian demand that
                            they be permitted to stay in their two so-called bases in the Congo and
                            the other was the question of Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName>, referring to Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ comments on the orientation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, said he understood
                            there were indications—besides evidence that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had been bought off—that recent developments in
                            the Congo were Communist-inspired. For example, interviews with
                            missionaries seemed to indicate that persons had been sent to the tribes
                            in advance of independence with instructions. The revolt appeared to
                            have been synchronized. It was important, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> felt, to step up our efforts to
                            prove that the revolt was Communist-inspired. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> agreed. He stated that we had
                            interviewed the missionaries. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> may have sent out instructions and these
                            instructions may have been under a Communist directive. The insurrection
                            had been simultaneous in many areas and it was therefore difficult to
                            find any other explanation. The Czech Consulate had been the center of
                            Communist intrigue in the Congo since 1955 or 1956. There was evidence
                            that orders had come from a central point. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said we were working very hard to
                            establish the facts.</p>

                        <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> opened
                            a news conference on July 21 by reading a statement on the situation in
                            the Congo. He charged that Soviet threats of intervention in the Congo
                            were “recklessly irresponsible” and declared that the United States
                            would “continue to back with all its moral force and material resources
                            the action of the United Nations to restore peace and order.” The text
                            of the statement is printed in <hi rend="italic">American Foreign
                                Policy: Current Documents, 1960,</hi> pages 536–537.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then read a statement replying to a Soviet statement of
                            July 19 protesting the presence of 20 U.S. military personnel in
                            Léopoldville. He stated that the U.S. personnel were not part of the
                            U.N. force in the Congo but were engaged, with U.N. approval, in
                            assisting with the airlift of U.N. supplies, food, troops, and equipment
                            and that they would remain in Léopoldville only as long as U.S.
                            assistance in the airlift was required. The Soviet statement had been
                            made on July 19 in Moscow by Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei A. Gromyko</persName> to Chargé Edward L.
                            Freers. The U.S. statement was made formally on July 21 by Deputy
                            Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Richard H. Davis to
                            Soviet Chargé Mikhail N. Smirnovsky. The texts of both are <hi

                            this and feel there is nothing in it for us and it would be more to our

                            intervention with PanAm that is all right. The Secretary said we should
                            take the line that we have no authority to do anything about commercial
                            airlines, and that to make it possible on anything else would make us
                            not be doing our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> job in getting troops
                            airlifted into the Congo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"

                                >UN</gloss> troops and presence Belgian troops Katanga pose complex
                            policy problem. Adverse reaction African states including present Congo
                            Government, to Belgian presence in Katanga inevitable and will become
                            stronger if Belgian troops remain for some time. It also likely that
                            Congo, divested of principal source income, could ultimately represent

                            after present unrest has been settled. Against this must be balanced
                            advantage of maintaining pro-Western orientation of at least part of
                            Congo and protection of its industries. At very least, denial of Katanga
                            assets to Soviet influence through Communist-oriented central government
                            extremely important. Much depends on eventual political outcome of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention, and character of
                            Congo leadership which might emerge during intervention and after
                            withdrawal of Belgian and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops.
                            Department sees as distinct possibility emergence of several <pb n="345"
                                xml:id="pg_345" facs="0375"/>regional centers of political strength,
                            each dominated by local leaders with tribal backing and perhaps linked
                            in loose federal structure with few important powers left for central
                            government. The relationship of Katanga to such possible federation and
                            role of Belgian influence in it is obscure at moment. In any case Dept
                            continues opposed any fragmentation of Congo and continues to hope that
                            with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military and technical
                            assistance, degree of economic recovery can be initiated and government
                            stabilized thus precluding definitive independence Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Department hopes that visible Belgian political and military presence in
                            Katanga can be minimized. However, US should avoid giving impression it
                            fostering extinction Belgian interests there or attempting supplant
                            those interests. Such position on part US would undoubtedly seriously
                            offend Belgians as well as other metropolitan powers, which probably
                            would support Belgium’s desire salvage what it can in Katanga. This
                            could cause serious split among <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            powers. Recognize also that question independent Katanga closely linked
                            in Belgian minds with future status enormous Belgian mining interests
                            and Kamina base, which Belgians will strive hard to retain.</p>
                        <p>Dept hopes that, if Katanga is to continue as independent, reliable local
                            security force with African officers can be trained and African
                            administrators worked into posts with real responsibility. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical assistance in these fields
                            would ensure such training would in fact be carried out and would remove
                            some of stigma Katanga independence from viewpoint African states. In
                            any case Tshombe’s blatant opposition to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> not helpful anyone now. It may be possible present these

                        <p>Meantime Department suggests that public statements on Katanga question
                            be limited to position that (1) at present time we do not recognize

                        <p>The U.N. Security Council continued its discussion of the crisis in the
                            Congo at its 878th meeting on July 21 and its 879th meeting, July 21–22.
                            At the former, Tunisian Representative <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Mongi
                                Slim</persName> introduced draft Resolution S/4404, cosponsored by
                            Ceylon, which, after minor amendments by its sponsors, was unanimously
                            adopted by the Council on July 22 as Resolution S/4405. It called upon
                            Belgium to “implement speedily” the Security Council’s July 14
                            resolution on the withdrawal of its troops and authorized the
                            Secretary-General to take all necessary action to this effect, and it
                            requested all states to refrain from any action which might tend to
                            impede the restoration of law and order and the Congo Government’s

                                Unilateral Sino-Soviet Bloc Military Intervention in the Republic of
                                the Congo (S)</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. Officials of the Republic of the Congo have indicated an inclination
                            to invite Soviet military intervention in the present unstable internal
                            security situation in the Republic of the Congo, if the government of
                            Belgium fails immediately to withdraw its military forces from the area.
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has asserted its readiness to
                            respond favorably to such an invitation. Such action on the part of the
                            Republic of the Congo and the Soviet Union is inconsistent with the
                            Resolution of the Security <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0377"
                            />Council of the United Nations relating to providing U.N. military
                            forces to restore order in the Congo. The Soviet Union voted
                            affirmatively on this resolution.</p>
                        <p>2. The introduction of Sino-Soviet Bloc military forces into the Congo
                            may in effect militate against the effectiveness of U.N. forces now
                            being provided to restore order, could give rise to serious conflict
                            with Belgian forces present in the area, and could result in Soviet
                            domination of the Republic of the Congo thereby facilitating the spread
                            of Communism among African states.</p>
                        <p>3. There is urgent need for the United States to seize the initiative and
                            create circumstances which tend to forestall a Soviet decision to
                            intervene in the Congo, and, in the event they, nonetheless, should
                            elect to do so, create circumstances which will embarrass them and
                            frustrate their aims.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet military intervention in the Congo poses great practical
                            difficulties for the Soviets. Essentially they are limited to airlifting
                            forces into the area or sealifting them. The former is the most
                            expeditious means but the latter is the most feasible. There are general
                            measures that the United States can undertake to aggravate the Soviet
                            problem and consequences of their action as well as certain specific
                            measures which tend to forestall the possible success of either an
                            airlift or a sealift. Moreover, there are measures that the United
                            States should take in the event of a Soviet attempt to intervene or if
                            actual intervention by them becomes a fact.</p>
                        <p>5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that:</p>
                        <p>a. To forestall or impede the successful introduction of Sino-Soviet Bloc
                            military elements into the Congo the following courses of action should
                            be considered by the United States:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(1) General:</p>
                        <p>(a) Acknowledging the fact that the aggregate troop level of Belgian
                            forces now in the Congo and U.N. forces now present or enroute, is
                            adequate to restore order and that further Belgian reinforcement or the
                            introduction of other non-U.N. sponsored foreign military forces will
                            only further aggravate the situation, recommend the United Nations
                            urgently now declare a blockade to preclude the introduction of further
                            non-U.N. sponsored military forces.</p>
                        <p>(b) Foster general and especially U.N. objection to the further
                            introduction of non-U.N. sponsored military forces into the Congo. Cause
                            the United Nations to exhort the Soviet Union to restrain themselves
                            from interference in the Congo situation.</p>
                        <p>(c) In order to ease tensions and forestall complication of the task of
                            the U.N. forces recommend the United Nations now declare an arms embargo
                            to the Republic of the Congo for a period to be determined.</p>
                        <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0378"/>
                        <p>(d) Encourage the United Nations to operate and administer immediately
                            river and harbor facilities and pipeline in the lower Congo using
                            Western technicians. Such action could be vital to prevent Soviet bloc
                            technicians from gaining control of this vital and only entrance to the
                            Congo from the sea.</p>
                        <p>(2) To forestall a successful airlift:</p>
                        <p>(a) Bring pressure on countries which might be subject to overflight,
                            through the United Nations and directly, to both deny overflight
                            authority and, if feasible, militarily oppose such overflight if
                            undertaken.</p>
                        <p>(b) Bring pressure, through the United Nations and directly, on nations
                            along possible air routes to deny air staging facilities and <gloss
                                target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> support to all elements of a Soviet
                            military airlift.</p>
                        <p>(c) Cause the United Nations to close all Congo airports to elements of a
                            Soviet airlift.</p>
                        <p>(d) Make representations to the United Nations to cause their military
                            elements in the Congo to plan, organize, and be ready to physically
                            obstruct all suitable landing fields in the Congo from Soviet use by
                            passively blocking runways.</p>
                        <p>(3) To forestall a successful sealift:</p>
                        <p>(a) Implement the measure cited in subparagraph 5a(1)(a) relative to
                            establishing a U.N. blockade.</p>
                        <p>(b) Make representation to the United Nations to plan, organize, and be
                            ready to physically restrict ship passage into the mouth of lower
                            Congo.</p>
                        <p>6. In the event that Sino-Soviet Bloc military intervention in the Congo
                            is attempted or becomes a fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded
                            that the United States should:</p>
                        <p>a. Make strong representation in the United Nations against such
                            Sino-Soviet action as being contrary to the previous resolution passed
                            by the United Nations Security Council and further as being unilateral
                            imperialistic interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of
                            the Congo.</p>
                        <p>b. Unilaterally with the Belgians and within the United Nations and
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, encourage the Belgians to
                            expedite the withdrawal of all their military forces from the Congo.</p>
                        <p>c. In addition to United Nations actions, effective or otherwise, the
                            United States must be prepared at any time to take appropriate military
                            action as necessary to prevent or defeat Soviet military intervention in
                            the Congo. Multilateral action would be preferable but unilateral action
                            may be necessary. In the present Soviet belligerent mood, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could estimate that the United States
                            would not oppose them. We must be prepared to oppose and defeat them. In
                            order to prevent their making such a rash move, they must be made to
                            understand that we will not tolerate a Soviet military takeover of the
                            Congo.</p>
                        <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0379"/>
                        <p>d. After the Sino-Soviet military forces have intervened in the Congo
                            take action within the United Nations to insist that the Sino-Soviet
                            forces withdraw from the Congo immediately after internal order has been
                            secured; thereafter internal security in the Congo can be maintained as
                            long as necessary by the U.N. forces.</p>
                        <p>e. Directly and through the United Nations bring pressure to bear on the
                            Republic of the Congo to recognize that early re-establishment of a
                            viable republic requires restoration of world confidence through
                            whole-hearted cooperation with the United Nations and that the presence
                            of non-United Nations sponsored military forces in the area militates
                            against this objective. Therefore, the Republic of the Congo should
                            request the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces.</p>

                            scheme where <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has ultimate
                            control of army.</p>
                        <p>Utter disorganization Congo at this point leads me to conclude strong
                            central government can be established only if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> able set up ruthless authoritarian regime and
                            impose rule of force on provinces. If <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> succeeds in dominating Katanga, any promise
                            rapid economic recovery and prospect political liberalism in this area
                            would be sacrificed in interest maintaining what are basically
                            artificial Colonial frontiers. If he fails in this, Katanga probably
                            destined to drift away from Leopoldville in any event.</p>
                        <p>Foremost argument for Katanga independence is likelihood that a moderate
                            government located in this strategic region of Africa will maintain
                            pro-western orientation. Effect on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            alliance of preservation Belgian interests here also important, although
                            I believe <gloss target="#t_GOB1">GOB</gloss> conscious of headaches
                            inherent in remaining here and is primarily concerned with redeeming
                            national honor by securing area of influence for Belgian interests and
                            residents who appear completely washed up in remainder of Congo.</p>
                        <p>Weaknesses Katanga regime are evident. Tshombe and ministers incapable
                            governing now and appear willing front for white technicians until they
                            can learn art of statecraft. Sooner or later African population will
                            demand changes in this arrangement but meanwhile European business
                            interests may have worked out satisfactory accommodation with emerging
                            leaders. Another weakness is poor quality of majority of white settlers
                            backing Tshombe, which may have been major consideration in hesitation
                            important Belgian economic interests to espouse cause of separatists.
                            Finally, heavy leaning by Katanga on Belgium might even totally
                            embarrass latter and even involve Belgian troops in incidents with other
                            Congo provinces.</p>
                        <p>While opposition within Katanga to independence exists and may be
                            expected increase, it appears inarticulate for moment for reasons given
                            in reference <gloss target="#t_Contel1">Contel</gloss>.<note n="2"
                                target="d146fn2">Telegram 13 reported that Tshombe’s support had
                                increased due to the disorganization of the opposition, the absence

                                of Representatives, and the lack of clear alternatives for Katanga.
                                It predicted, however, that a strong reaction would set in against
                                the concept of an “independent Katanga serving interests western
                                business in central Africa.”</note> Although no public announcement
                            yet made, Jason Sendwe and his lieutenants reported willing (but

                        <p>2. We are trying to get decision from <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> re his visiting Washington and will report as
                            soon as we get information. From speaking to various members of party,
                            we believe <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> does not have
                            much idea of what he wants to do during trip nor when he wants to do it.
                            His party was pulled together at last minute and came with no advance
                            preparation (and no money). We believe US will have to take charge of
                            arrangements for <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> starting
                            about Tuesday morning. We understand <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                            be too dull to hold <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> for
                            two solid days, believe he will start looking for things to do about
                            Tuesday, if not earlier. In any event, Tuesday night <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> will be through with <persName

                            stayed closest to him during very brief reception and press conference.
                            Marof (Guinea) also much in evidence and acted as interpreter during
                            press conference. Lunch Sunday took place at Ghana Embassy Residence,
                            New Rochelle. Only part of party went, others stayed behind at Barclay
                            Hotel and rested. At 4 p.m. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and selected advisors had meeting with <gloss

                            press conference.</p>
                        <p>4. Saturday afternoon Cordier (Secretariat) implied Secretariat would
                            take charge of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and party
                            during their New York visit. Cordier said he had told Richard Patterson

                            hospitality required. Little later Wieschhoff<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d147fn5">Heinrich Wieschhoff.</note> (Secretariat) gave very
                            different impression. He said <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>,
                            through <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>, had tried to
                            discourage <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> from coming;
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s attitude now was that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had decided to make
                            himself “available” for discussions. Wieschhoff said Secretariat had no
                            idea how long <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would stay,
                            whom he wished to see or where he wished to go. Secretariat “assumed”
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would want to go to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>5. Kanza Saturday went to see <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> after
                            having heard <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> definitely
                            coming. Kanza did not have any precise information on <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s plans or hopes, but did have
                            exploratory talk with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> as to what
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> might do at <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            tried to plant idea with Kanza that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> should return to Leopoldville and be there when
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> visits. However, Wieschhoff
                            doubted this feasible since to do this he would have to leave Wednesday
                            night and Wieschhoff had impression <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> intended to stay one week.</p>
                        <p>6. Kanza told <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> he hoped <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> might have opportunity to
                            address <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> but <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> discouraged that and instead suggested <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> lunch Monday to which African <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reps would also be invited. That would
                            provide opportunity for <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to
                            talk with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members informally (lunch
                            now officially announced and invitations sent). As already reported,
                            Kanza also suggested to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> that State
                            Department should assign someone to accompany <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> all during trip and be able to give him counsel
                            as to whom he should see as well as provide channel to US
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>7. Following our talk with Wieschhoff Saturday, and our getting report on
                                Kanza-<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> meeting, we telephoned

                                target="#t_AF1">AF</gloss>, and suggested Dept be prepared to step
                            in and take over planning of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s visit to US. Otherwise there would be little
                            planning or <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0383"/>arrangements and
                            visit could become shambles or, worse still, might be taken over by
                            people who would not act in interests of US foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>8. Saturday Dadzie (Ghana) called to say he hoped arrangement could be
                            made for <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to visit
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> while in US.
                            We gave Dadzie no encouragement but agreed to report his suggestion.
                            Sunday morning at airport, Quaison-Sackey again urged arrangement be
                            made for visit to President. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                        <p>At the 453d meeting of the National Security Council, held at Newport on
                            July 25, Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Allen Dulles</persName> discussed developments in the Congo during
                            his briefing on significant world developments. The relevant portion of
                            the memorandum of discussion by <persName corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W.
                                Boggs</persName>, July 28, reads as follows: “The situation in the
                            Congo, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> continued, had been temporarily
                            eased. Half of the 12,000 man <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force
                            had arrived on the scene and reinforcements were coming in hourly. The
                            Belgian troops had pulled back to two Congo bases everywhere except in
                            Katanga. The Prime Minister of Katanga having failed to secure
                            recognition of his province as an independent state, was now proposing a
                            loose federation of Katanga and other adjacent provinces. Katanga was
                            the richest part of the Congo, supplying two-thirds of the Congo’s
                            mineral production. Mr. McCone said we no longer considered the Congo an
                            important source of uranium for the U.S. “Continuing, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that the Congo needs technicians
                            and administrators but does not want white technicians. Accordingly, the
                            Congo may approach the other African Governments with a request <pb

                            these other governments have no technicians or administrators to spare.
                            The President said perhaps an <gloss target="#t_FEPC1">FEPC</gloss>
                            (Fair Employment Practices Commission) was needed in the Congo. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said unemployment and a shortage of food
                            had created a serious situation in the Congo. Another serious problem
                            was <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> himself, who had been
                            described by <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Ralph Bunche</persName> as
                            “crazy.” It had been reported that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> would visit the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> after completing his visit to the U.S. and Canada. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that a Russian mission to the Congo
                            conferred with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, after
                            which <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> withdrew his threat
                            to request the intervention of Soviet troops in the Congo. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> believed that it was a reasonable
                            inference that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had felt it was
                            getting too involved in the Congo and had induced <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to abandon his idea of calling
                            for Soviet forces.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said it was
                            difficult to understand why <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was in the U.S. He had not asked to come to
                            Washington. He arrived in New York without any funds and without anyone
                            knowing who was responsible for providing him with funds. It was not
                            known what he had to do after being entertained by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at lunch today. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had said he was coming to the
                            U.S. to obtain technical assistance. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> thought that if he stayed away
                            from the Congo long enough, he would find he had no government when he
                            returned. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName> said
                            if it was to our advantage to keep <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> away from the Congo, then we ought to arrange
                            for him to stay in the U.S. for awhile. The President said that we might
                            provide <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> with a three weeks
                            tour of the U.S. on a modest basis.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said he was worried about the Detwiler
                            activities in the Congo. Detwiler has a reputation of beginning many
                            things but of not finishing anything. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said Detwiler was a fabulous
                            promotor who has not really promoted anything. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said it had been reported that Mr.
                            Max Rabb was associated with Detwiler. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he had checked on this
                            report and discovered that Mr. Rabb had never answered Detwiler’s
                            letter. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said
                            Detwiler was a notorious name-dropper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName> remarked that Detwiler, however, some eight years
                            ago obtained a contract for an iron ore concession in Liberia. This
                            concession is now operative with U.S. and Swedish money. Apparently one
                            Detwiler project actually became operative. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said the Detwiler operations in the
                            Congo would arouse the antagonism of the French, who will say that the
                            U.S. is in Africa for the purpose of obtaining concessions. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>’s checking on Mr.
                            Rabb’s association with Detwiler showed that not all the persons
                            mentioned in the press as Detwiler’s supporters are actually behind
                            him.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                        <p>Direct Communist involvement in the Congo disorders has been suggested or
                            implied by a number of sources, both official and private. While the
                            army mutiny responsible for the disorders may have had some central
                            organization or leadership, we have no evidence, beyond rumors, that
                            would link the mutiny to a Communist plot. While we do not doubt that
                            the Soviet Bloc will continue to attempt to exploit the disorders in the
                            Congo, we have no substantial or convincing proof of direct Communist
                            involvement with the possible exception of one incident. This is a
                            report that a Belgian known to be a Communist was arrested in the
                            Katanga for broadcasting false radio messages to confuse local Belgian
                            Army units.</p>
                        <p>The Communists do not have an efficient and well-established apparatus in
                            the Congo that would permit them to manipulate existing forces, judging
                            from available intelligence. They were effectively excluded from the
                            Congo throughout virtually the whole period of Belgian colonial
                            administration and thus were not able to recruit and build up local
                            Communist Party organizations. [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines of source

                        <p>1. diffuse good will of many radical nationalist leaders attributable to
                            the active moral support received during recent months from the Bloc and

                        <p>2. personal contacts that several important Congolese politicians have
                            made with <gloss target="#t_BCP1">BCP</gloss> officials and, to a lesser
                            extent, with Bloc officials during the course of short pre-independence
                            trips to Moscow and satellite capitals (two of these

                        <p>Despite charges by the Belgians and his Congolese opponents that

                            Communist sympathizer, we have nothing to substantiate this allegation.
                            The most accurate summary of his views is probably his own declaration
                            of July 5, 1960, “We are not Communists, Catholics, or Socialists. We
                            are African nationalists. We reserve the right to be friendly with
                            anybody we like according to the principles of positive neutrality.”</p>

                                that it did not consider such a statement appropriate at that time,

                            present highly fluid situation in Congo and many complex problems
                            Department should during present crisis attempt reserve its public
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is an opportunist and
                            not a Communist. His final decision as to which camp he will eventually
                            belong will not be made by him but rather will be imposed upon him by
                            outside forces. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, who from
                            very beginning has stood for unity of Congo, would be sorely tempted
                            have recourse to Russia or bloc countries if we or Belgians were to
                            recognize Katanga and thus help bring about fragmentation of Congo. Such
                            a move by Belgians would also fly in face <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> policy with predictable reaction other African
                            countries. Indeed same reaction can be expected if Belgians refuse admit
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops or fail get theirs out
                            after <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arrival. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Comment</hi>: <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, There are
                            unconfirmed reports that Belgians, if forced to give way to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, will evacuate every Belgian citizen and
                            movable piece property. US journalists returning today from

                            atmosphere that may well be already beyond control of <gloss

                        <p>2. Historically, Katanga has resented power which former Government
                            General and now <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has and is wielding
                            from Leopoldville. Province has always believed it supporting rest of
                            Congo by making major contributions to country’s revenue. In political
                            sphere, Tshombe appears believe sincerely <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> to be dominated by Communists and by desire
                            become dictator. It is most unlikely he would ever place himself or
                            Katanga under Lumumba’s authority.</p>
                        <p>3. There has been increasing talk particularly among anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> politicians regarding creation
                            separate states in various parts of Congo including Bas-Congo, Equateur,
                            Kasai and Kivu, not to mention Katanga, which would substitute present
                            authority Central Government with loose confederation. Now that
                            Government General has been abolished and base of power of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has, with collapse Force Publique,
                            almost totally disappeared, force for unifying country has been
                            seriously impaired. In fact, most effective force left to bring about
                            unity of Congo appears to be <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Embassy
                            firmly believes we should continue support action and developing policy
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Congo.</p>
                        <p>4. Fact that few days ago Jason Sendwe’s appointment as official
                            representative (Commissaire d’Etat au Katanga) of Central Government in
                            Katanga was approved by Senate and in view of his many public statements
                            opposition secession, one must assume that he will continue oppose
                            independence of Katanga and support position of Lumumba.</p>

                            latter’s request. He began by outlining US attitude toward Congo as
                            stated both in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and in private talks
                            with Belgians. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> replied by
                            describing pre-independence hopes for Belgian cooperation and
                            assistance. Instead, he said, Belgium had left <pb n="358"

                            having been taken to Brussels just prior to independence and (b) with
                            insufficient trained Congolese to run country.</p>
                        <p>As to atrocities of which Belgians have complained in Security Council,
                            he said entire police and court system was in Belgian hands even after
                            independence, there being only one Congolese lawyer in entire country,
                            and yet no Belgian had ever formally brought charges against Congolese
                            for molesting women or other alleged atrocities. They had refused try
                            use regular means which they themselves administered. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said he had ordered strict
                            enforcement of the laws to protect all, but his orders had not been
                            carried out by Belgian officials.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said Belgians had long
                            taught them there no difference fundamentally between Russians and
                            Americans since both would come to Congo to exploit it. However, he said
                            Congolese had great faith in America; its missionaries had done good
                            work and Congolese people had great faith in our willingness help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> added Belgians had tried
                            make Congo “island” isolated from its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said Congolese financial
                            position desperate. There not even enough money to pay salaries of
                            government officials. He referred again to fact Belgians had shifted all
                            reserves to Brussels. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and
                            Kanza (Congo) both expressed hope US could provide loan urgently to
                            assist them during present critical period. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> referred to experience of Guinea in which French
                            had suddenly ended all assistance with result that Guinea had face
                            problems in any way it could. He saw parallel in Congo experiences with
                            Belgians.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> seemed pleased when

                            showed Congolese two letters from State Department officials (Kanza

                        <p>The Secretary opened the conversation by telling Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> that it was a pleasure to have
                            him here and by thanking him for the kind statement he had made at the
                                airport.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">The texts of the statements

                                August 15, 1960, p. 245.</note> The Secretary added that <pb n="360"
                                xml:id="pg_360" facs="0390"/>he would be glad to discuss any
                            problems confronting the government of the Congo.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied by expressing the emotion which he and all
                            members of his delegation had felt in response to the welcome afforded
                            them at the airport. This gave them, he said, the impression that the
                            United States recognized the Congo on the same footing as any other
                            sovereign state and that among the various difficulties the Congo faces,
                            they know that they will find the aid they desire from the United
                            States. He said that the people of the Congo have enormous confidence in
                            the United States even in the most remote villages, and they know that
                            the United States is anti-colonialist. The Prime Minister went on to say
                            that the struggling of the Congolese had been only against a particular
                            regime and that all who struggle for liberation are treated like
                            bandits. The colonizers are able to present their version of the
                            anti-colonial stories in the international press, leaving the other side
                            silent. He remarked that the Congo can only build its independence with
                            the help of the civilized world but that in so doing should be careful
                            to ask themselves exactly what the aims are of the various countries
                            offering assistance. He said that the Congo must be vigilant in
                            consolidating its independence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> went on to say that the
                            first condition of the Congo is for peace and order. If there is
                            permanent political unrest, no one will have confidence in the country
                            and the foreign capital the Congolese need and want will stay away. In
                            this connection the Prime Minister said that his Government would
                            provide all guarantees necessary for the security of foreign
                            investments. The Prime Minister pointed out that with independence there
                            had been a complete break with Belgium insofar as the latter’s handling
                            of Congolese affairs was concerned and the Congo could not accept any
                            arrangement whereby they would deal with third countries through
                            intermediaries. He said that the Congolese must learn to run things
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the recent troubles in the Congo, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> pointed out that Article Six of
                            the Treaty of Friendship signed between Belgium and the Republic of the
                            Congo gave the Belgians the right to intervene only if specifically
                            requested to do so by the Congolese Government. He said no request was
                            ever made. He then described the events leading up to the revolt of the
                            Force Publique, pointing out that after the Round Table conference the
                            Executive College, which was set up as a temporary government, tried to
                            have a plan approved to Africanize the army, but that this was rejected
                            three times by General Janssens. He said when he became Prime Minister
                            he also assumed the Portfolio of Minister of Defense, with General
                            Janssens subject to his orders. He told the General to obtain some
                            African officers, but the General baldly refused, telling the army there
                            would be no change. In the days following independence, the Force
                            Publique</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0391"/>thereupon revolted. The Prime
                            Minister said that he and Chief of State <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> studied the situation in order to seek its
                            cause. They then toured the country trying to calm the army down.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then went on to describe the serious emotional impact
                            on the Congolese population when Belgium intervened with armed forces.
                            He said that the Congolese population in many areas panicked under the
                            impression that the Belgian troops were going to kill them. He said that
                            many Belgian civil servants had fled needlessly from the country and
                            that the reports of atrocities by the Force Publique were largely
                            Belgian propaganda. Since there were no Congolese magistrates or
                            lawyers, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said he asked
                            the Belgian magistrates to bring all guilty persons to trial and to
                            punish them, his aim being to protect everyone whether white or black.
                            The magistrates, however, held no trials and condemned no one, although
                            soldiers were placed at their disposal. The Prime Minister denied that
                            there had been any molestation of white women.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then remarked that the populace remained very excited
                            and that Congolese soldiers were being killed daily. He said that he had
                            called for calm and decided to appeal to the United Nations. Belgium,
                            however, he said, still refuses to withdraw her troops although
                            requested to do so by the Security Council and both houses of the
                            Congolese Parliament. He said the situation had been aggravated by a
                            letter from the Belgian Ambassador in Leopoldville<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d152fn3">According to Sedgwick’s notes, the letter was dated
                                July 14.</note> to the effect that there would be no withdrawal of
                            Belgian troops until such time as the United Nations had the situation
                            in hand and that the United States, which stands for liberty and
                            independence, was supporting Belgium in her desire to maintain her
                            troops in the Congo, contrary to the wishes of the Security Council. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said that on receipt
                            of this letter he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            decided to study the situation and that if the United States did not
                            wish to help, they would appeal to the United Nations, to the Soviet
                            Union, and to any other country that would. He said that the Congolese
                            Government had explained its position accordingly. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> then said, in order to dissipate
                            these misunderstandings he decided to go to the United States and
                            establish contract with the Department. He then said that he
                            subsequently learned from the Secretary-General of the United Nations
                            that the statement in the Belgian letter had been incorrect and that the
                            Security Council, including the United States, had voted unanimously to
                            request the withdrawal of Belgian troops. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> then read the letter in question, giving the
                            Belgian interpretation of the Security Council resolution as permitting
                            them to remain <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0392"/>as long as 3 to
                            6 months. He said that if the United States had, in fact, supported this
                            position, there would have been a rupture between it and the Congo.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then went on to say there is in the Congo a glad
                            feeling of friendship for Belgium and that there is no wish to break
                            these ties. The Congolese, he said, wish the Belgians to know that they
                            have everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing this
                            friendship. He added, however, that the continued killing of Congolese
                            soldiers by Belgians makes the situation extremely difficult and the
                            Congo still might be forced to appeal to all outside powers for
                            assistance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> said that
                            5 minutes after the Belgian troops leave, order will be restored. He
                            maintained that the secession of Katanga does not represent the will of
                            the people of that territory and that Tshombe is being used as a Belgian
                            tool. The Congo, he said, with its 6 provinces, forms a single state and
                            is so recognized by all countries, including the United States. Tshombe
                            is simply an instrument of the Belgians, and there is no Katanga state,
                            according to the Prime Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> added that if Belgian troops remain in the
                            Congo, there may be general riots. He said that if the United Nations
                            does not provide satisfaction, the United States or some other country
                            will have to help. He added that there is no further danger to any
                            Belgian citizens and no reason, therefore, why the Belgian troops cannot
                            be withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he desired the immediate restoration of
                            order so that the capital may flow in in order to enable the country to
                            carry out its plan of industrialization. He said it is his aim to seek a
                            flow of American capital and technicians of all kinds so that the Congo,
                            which has great natural resources, may be able to develop them. He
                            pointed out that Belgium had impounded the Congo’s gold reserves and
                            refused to permit the transfer of the seat of the Banque Centrale from
                            Brussels to Léopoldville. He said the Congolese could not understand,
                            and it appears that their entire patrimony has been confiscated by
                            Belgium. As a result, the Government has no money of [with] which to pay
                            its officials and workers; there is unemployment; a great shortage of
                            doctors, etc. He said that absence of technicians created a serious
                            situation. The Prime Minister said that the Belgian Government is doing
                            everything in its power to devalue the Congolese franc and that he
                            planned, therefore, to have conversations with the International Bank
                            and [International] Monetary Fund. He will ask these agencies to send
                            fiscal and customs experts and probably persons to control river
                            traffic.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he did not wish the Congo to emerge from a
                            colonial status only to fall under the domination of some other form of
                            dictatorship or ideological influence. We are, he said, Africans and
                            wish to remain so and [<hi rend="italic">with</hi>] our policy being one
                            of positive <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0393"/>neutralism. He
                            remarked that he knew that the Congo had a friend in the United States
                            because it, too, struggled to obtain its independence. He said that he
                            sincerely wanted the United States to help. The Congo, he said, does not
                            wish to be exploited and that if any conditions are attached to
                            assistance it will not be accepted. He said that the United States needs
                            Congolese resources such as uranium, and the Congo needs American
                            products. He said he hoped the United States would use its influence
                            with the Belgian Government [so] that the latter might understand that
                            its actions are contrary to its own best interests and contrary to the
                            interests of the West in general. He said that Belgium is trying to
                            foster animosity between the Congo and the United States, even though
                            the Congo desires reconciliation with Belgium.</p>
                        <p>For all of these reasons, the Prime Minister said, it is essential that
                            Belgian troops leave the Congo, and he earnestly solicited United States
                            assistance in persuading the Belgians to do so.<note n="4"

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he appreciated the Prime Minister’s frankness,
                            and he hoped he could talk of the role the United States could play in
                            assisting the Congo. He pointed out that following the Security
                            Council’s resolution,<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn5">Of July 14.</note> the
                            United States volunteered all possible assistance to the
                            Secretary-General, although making it clear that troops should be from
                            small nations, particularly African. The United States is, however, the
                            Secretary said, providing every logistical support at the express
                            request of the Secretary-General. He added the United States did not
                            plan to inject itself into the situation except where agreeable to the
                            Secretary-General. The Secretary stated that he understood the
                            Secretary-General was currently studying the Congo’s requirements and
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> has talked with

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he had talked
                            with the Secretary-General the day before, explaining that the United
                            States was prepared to give the Congo full support through the United
                            Nations during the emergency period while the United Nations remains
                            responsible. He said that Mr. Hammarskjold had told him that the United
                            Nations was going to take the responsibility for some time, not only for
                            technical assistance but also for such financial aid as might be
                            necessary. He reported that the Secretary-General felt that it might be
                            better to channel all aid through the United Nations so that there would
                            be one central group aware of our problems. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that he agreed with this
                            and that he told the Secretary-General that the United States would be
                            prepared to extend assistance at his request.</p>

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> expressed
                            his appreciation for the above remarks and said he believed that there
                            remained only a few questions of detail to be worked out with the
                            Secretary-General. He repeated, however, the urgent financial
                            requirements of the Congolese Government in order to meet current
                            obligations and payrolls. He said he was optimistic about the future of
                            his country since it is inherently rich, with the emergency being only
                            of a temporary nature. He said that he wished to express his sincere
                            gratitude, as well as that of the Chief of State of the Congo, who will
                            be very happy when they learn of these discussions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> reiterated his concern over the
                            status of the Congolese franc, and he said again that he would discuss
                            it with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he understood that Mr. Hammarskjold was
                            asking a high-ranking member of his staff who was a specialist in <gloss

                                >Lumumba</persName> replied that perhaps if this were the case it
                            would not be necessary for him to see the Fund in Washington. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> answered by saying
                            that he believed it would still be most advisable that the Prime
                            Minister establish contacts with both the Fund and the Bank.<note n="6"

                        <p>The Prime Minister then said he hoped to obtain an official loan from the
                            United States, as well as private loans, during his visit. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed his feeling that
                            during the present period of emergency, with the United Nations willing
                            to take the responsibility for improving the situation, the United
                            States believed it would be more helpful if it operated through the
                            Secretary-General. This would not, he said, be the case beyond the
                            period of which the United Nations was willing to maintain
                            responsibility and that at a later date it would be practical for the
                            two countries to have direct financial relations. For the time being,
                            however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said, the
                            United States Government funds would be available through the United
                            Nations. He said this was not, of course, the case with respect to loans
                            from private sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then said that he
                            wished to raise the question of the American businessman, Mr. Detwiler,
                            who had signed a contract with the Congolese Government, claiming the
                            moral support of the State Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said that he wished to point out that this man
                            had no connection with the United States Government and no access to the
                            United States Government funds. He said that he wished to make this very
                            clear and suggested that the Prime Minister make any <pb n="365"
                                xml:id="pg_365" facs="0395"/>inquiries he wanted to in this country
                            concerning Mr. Detwiler’s ability to carry out his commitments. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> went on to say that
                            there was one matter in which the United States could be of direct
                            assistance outside of the United Nations, namely through the 300
                            scholarships which had been offered on the occasion of the Congo’s
                            independence. He said that he thought these scholarships would be
                            helpful in beginning a substantial program of technical cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for the above and said that
                            the Detwiler affair had been a complete misunderstanding. He said that
                            the Congolese Government has not concluded any agreement with Mr.
                            Detwiler and that any such agreement will require the approval of both
                            the Administerial Commission [<hi rend="italic">Council of
                                Minsters?</hi>] and the Congolese Parliament. He said that Detwiler
                            would never set foot in the Congo again.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then raised the question of the INGA project, pointing
                            out that all the necessary technical studies had been completed and the
                            file submitted by Belgium to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>.
                            After independence the Belgians had proposed that the two governments
                            share the project, but the Government of the Congo had refused, saying
                            they would deal directly with the Bank, as was their sovereign right. He
                            said that he wished the work on the INGA project to begin at once, since
                            it is vital to the Congolese economy. Through it, he said, unemployment
                            could be eliminated, the labor force put to work and the country’s
                            resources developed. He therefore wished to ask the United States
                            Government or private sources of financing, to give assistance as soon
                            as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied
                            that the United States Government had known about the project in a
                            general way, since the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> is
                            interested. He said that the United States has encouraged the Bank to
                            study the project and to be prepared to assist. He said that he believed
                            that the Bank thought the project a good one. He pointed out, however,
                            that the Bank only makes loans to members and it would be advisable,
                            therefore, for the Congo to join the Bank. To do so, he pointed out,
                            they must also join the Fund.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he believed that he had now touched on all
                            problems of particular concern to him but wished to repeat his request
                            for United States intervention to effect a withdrawal of Belgian troops.
                            The Secretary replied that the Department is in contact with Mr.
                            Hammarskjold and that our understanding of the situation is the same as
                            his. He said that the United States realized the difficulties of the
                            situation and would do what it could to be of assistance. The Secretary
                            added that he understood that the Secretary-General was trying to be of
                            assistance in meeting the August 1 payroll of the Congolese Government.
                            He said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had been
                            discussing this matter with United Nations officials and that he hoped
                            that their discussions would bear fruit.</p>
                        <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then said that there was one thing which he had
                            forgotten to mention, namely civil aviation. He said that Sabena is
                            already operating in the Congo, the Belgian company in which there has
                            been considerable Congolese participation. He said that the suggestion
                            has been made that the corporate stock of Sabena be modified, but that
                            the Government of the Congo prefers the creation of its own national
                            airline. He asked the advice of the Department on this matter which he
                            described as very urgent. The Prime Minister then stressed his own need
                            for a small aircraft for himself and the Chief of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that the United
                            States would be happy to study with the appropriate United Nations
                            agencies the best way to solve the airline question. He pointed out the
                            United States has assisted other countries in developing their civil
                            aviation, such as Ethiopia. He said that he was sure that something
                            could be done. With respect to the small aircraft for the Government,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said he would be glad
                            to look into it. The Secretary pointed out that the United States had
                            placed at the disposal of the United Nations several small military
                            aircraft without pilots. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> suggested that the Prime Minister discuss this
                            matter with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> on his
                            return to Leopoldville, to see if one of these aircraft might not be
                            made available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> returned to the general

                            charges. The Congo is the only one entitled to make charges if they are
                            justified. Referring to charges made by the Soviet Union, he said he did
                            not suspect the intentions of the United States. If he did so, he should
                            not have gone to this country but gone elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he appreciated all of the Prime Minister’s remarks and
                            was sorry that the President could not be in Washington during the time
                            of the Prime Minister’s visit. He wished to assure him, however, of our
                            willingness to assist him to see anyone in Washington or elsewhere in
                            the United States, if the Congolese delegation so desired. The Prime
                            Minister replied that he had been wondering if he might not pay his
                            respects to the President and also to the Vice President and Senator
                            Kennedy. The Secretary said that, unfortunately, he did not know what
                            the President’s itinerary was but that he would discuss this matter with
                            other officials of the Department. He said it would be impossible to
                            make an appointment at that time but the matter could be re-examined
                            when the Prime Minister’s travel plans became definite.<note n="7"

                            had been instructed to call to express the amazement of the Belgian
                            Government at the reception which <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had received in Washington. He said the official
                            invitation extended to <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>,
                            the fact that he stayed in Blair House and the honors which he had
                            received had all made a great and very painful impression on the Belgian
                            Government and the Belgian people. He said the Belgian Government
                            thought that the US had made a choice in favor of the viewpoint of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as against that of the
                            Belgians. He said the big reception which the Congolese leader had
                            received here would strengthen his position in the Congo and would
                            weaken that of Belgium as well as that of anti-<persName

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> said that the
                            Belgian Government had also been pained to see that on the first
                            Security Council vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the
                            United States had voted in favor of the resolution presented and had not
                            abstained as had the British and the French. He said there had been a
                            lack of support for Belgium in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by
                            the United States. He said that the Belgian Government was very
                            distressed at the events of yesterday in connection with the reception
                            of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. He said he thought the
                            reaction was somewhat similar to that which would occur in the United
                            States if the Belgian Government were to invite Fidel Castro to visit
                            Brussels and accord him a great reception. He repeated that there had
                            been a strong and unfavorable reaction in Belgium to the reception of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in Washington. In this
                            context he said that <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0398"/>Belgium
                            had remained firmly loyal to the United States and a devoted ally. In
                            the past there had not been any problems between Belgium and the United
                            States. Belgium had wished to limit political consultation in the
                            Community of Six in order to avoid there being any creation of a bloc
                            position against the United States. Similarly the Belgians had sought to
                            have the Sixes and Sevens problem evolve in a way that would not be
                            unfavorable to US interests.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary in replying said that we had of course heard more or less
                            the same thing from Belgium directly with regard to Belgian reactions to
                            the <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> visit to

                                troops into Katanga and into the Belgian bases in the Congo. He told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> that the Belgians
                                knew the United States had not sent such a message although the
                                British and French had done so. (Memorandum of telephone

                            that yesterday’s events had caused so much trouble in Belgium. He said

                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would have been a refusal of
                            normal courtesies. There was a protocol problem involved for us.
                            However, we regretted the very bad effect which our reception of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had had in Belgium and
                            he hoped it would be realized that the position we had taken was
                            mandatory for us. The Secretary noted that we had not selected <persName

                            but had inherited him along with independence. In the light of the
                            circumstances we felt we had no choice in the way we had received him.
                            However, the Secretary did wish to express regret and indicate that we
                            were fully conscious of all the things which the Ambassador had said
                            regarding Belgian-American friendship. He said that we had not intended
                            to give the impression we were choosing up sides against Belgium on
                            Congolese issues.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued saying he did not believe that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been very happy with his
                            talks here. He said that the U.S. had taken the line that we would not
                            proffer any aid independently but would operate through the <gloss

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> next inquired
                            as to what our position was on the outstanding issues of the Belgian
                            bases and the Katanga. The Ambassador said that the Belgian talks with
                            Hammarskjold in Brussels had been unsatisfactory. He referred to
                            previous conversations with the Secretary and said he thought that
                            previously there had been agreement that there was no urgency in sending
                            troops to Katanga where order prevailed. He added that if <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops were to go to Katanga now there
                            would be a renewed flight of Belgian technicians, who had returned to
                            the area, to Rhodesia. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1"
                                >Scheyven</persName> said that he hoped we still shared Belgian
                            views on this point and would so inform Hammarskjold. He noted
                            Hammarskjold had said he thought it was necessary to send troops to
                            Katanga. In this event Belgian forces would be obliged to withdraw.
                            Therefore he thought that we needed to buy time on this issue,
                            particularly since Tshombe appears to have altered his own position.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> stated that
                            Belgium had originally believed a unitary government was desirable for
                            the Congo but was not sure that this was any longer possible. The
                            Belgian position continued strongly in favor of collaboration with the
                            Congolese and Belgium still wished to do what it could in the technical
                            field. Therefore it was essential to have some time to arrange
                            evacuation of the bases. Belgium hoped that her allies would tell
                            Hammarskjold now that he should not force the issue of the evacuation of
                            the bases or the Katanga problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> continued,
                            saying that the Belgians realized they would have to evacuate the bases
                            eventually since their treaty only called for them to remain if the
                            Congolese wished and it was quite clear that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> now wished them to depart. He said Belgium would
                            be ready to withdraw when the time was ripe but that if the issue were
                            forced now Belgian technicians would leave the Congo even though the
                            Belgian Government wished them to remain and had indeed ordered many
                            back to their jobs in order to assist with the maintenance of the
                            Congolese economy. He said he thought the job of replacing all of the
                            Belgian technicians and civil servants in the Congo was too great for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> were to enter Katanga and force the Belgians out of
                            their bases the result would be chaos, he concluded.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> asked again if
                            the United States agreed with this position and would use its influence
                            with Hammarskjold to this end. It was the Belgian impression that
                            Hammarskjold’s position had hardened recently and that the trend of his
                            thinking is to force the Belgians out now. He said he had no doubts that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was also pressing in
                            this direction.</p>

                        <p>In reply, the Secretary said that he could tell the Ambassador for his
                            Government’s information only that we had sent word to Hammarskjold that
                            we did not think it would be advisable for him to send troops to the
                            Katanga until he himself had visited the area or sent a principal
                            assistant there.<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Telegram 282 to

                                770G.00/7–2760)</note> The thrust of our recommendation to
                            Hammarskjold was that he should go slow and not move hastily on
                            inserting troops into Katanga. Of course we did not know that he would
                            take our advice.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we did not wish the sense of our instructions
                            known publicly because our position was that individual nations should
                            not be active in connection with the Congo crisis and that should it be
                            known we were giving advice and recommendations to Hammarskjold there
                            might be an effect on possible Soviet intentions. In this connection the
                            Secretary noted that we would not for example move troops internally in
                            the Congo. In fact our entire posture was that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was the responsible agency. He said he
                            thought that when Hammarskjold was on the spot and saw the situation he
                            would act realistically.</p>
                        <p>Finally the Ambassador inquired again with regard to our position on the
                            Belgian bases in the Congo to which the Secretary replied that the
                            principal one was in Katanga anyway.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded saying we hoped the situation would evolve
                            satisfactorily and repeating that we were sorry our reception of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had caused problems
                            and had been misunderstood in Belgium. The Secretary said that if we had
                            not given the normal reception to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> it would appear that we were indicating we would
                            have nothing to do with him and his government.</p>

                            points:</p>
                        <p>1. He has not yet taken decision on Katanga and won’t until he has had
                            chance confer at length with <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>,
                            Von Horn, et al).</p>
                        <p>2. In any case he will not make move with troops until “way has been
                            cleared diplomatically”. This he has told Belgians.</p>
                        <p>3. He felt his discussions Brussels yesterday went relatively well and
                            described Belgian attitude as “not unhappy”. Added it would be too much
                            expect them be happy at this particular juncture.</p>
                        <p>4. Said he and Belgians still disagree over bases (Kamina and Kitona) but
                            he felt they tacitly recognized inevitability of their eventual
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>5. Felt Belgians had not appreciated repercussions whole Katanga
                            situation in other African countries and explained this at some
                            length.</p>
                        <p>6. Said problem now one of timing and while he hoped be able delay to let
                            Belgians tempers cool he also had to keep firm hand on Congolese and
                            African pulse. In all events could assure us he was well aware of
                            pitfalls and would proceed judiciously.</p>

                        <p>282. Senate President Joseph Ileo has advised Embassy officer it is
                            imperative <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> not be
                            permitted return empty-handed to Congo from US. He stated at least some
                            type of commitment or promise be made <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> for assistance to Congo in public or private
                            sectors. According Ileo if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            returns to Congo empty-handed he will state that although he tried
                            obtain assistance in order care for the unemployed and for helping
                            economy of country US turned him down. Ileo who claims to know <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> “a fond” is certain Prime
                            Minister will then turn for assistance to Soviet and bloc countries.</p>
                        <p>Embassy officer pointed out to Ileo such agreement cannot be drawn up
                            overnight, that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s original
                            intention was to go only to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but that
                            he has apparently converted visit into semi-official state visit to US.
                            Embassy, however, is of opinion there is much truth to Ileo’s statement
                            and while we do not wish build up <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> we should nonetheless do everything possible to
                            ensure he does not return to Congo with sort of negative ammunition for
                            approaches elsewhere that Ileo feared.<note n="1" xml:id="d155fn1"

                            Joint Chiefs of Staff. (Memorandum for <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> dated July 29, 1960) General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> asked whether the Secretary of
                            State agreed with the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as contained in
                            this report. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            said he generally agreed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            views although these views were vague in places and would have to be
                            made more specific before they could form the basis for concrete action.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then read what he called
                            the key section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff study, i.e. paragraph 6-c,
                            page 4:</p>
                        <p>“In addition to United Nations actions, effective or otherwise, the
                            United States must be prepared at any time to take appropriate military
                            action as necessary to prevent or defeat Soviet military intervention in
                            the Congo. Multilateral action would be preferable but unilateral action
                            may be necessary. In the present Soviet belligerent mood, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could estimate that the United States
                            would not oppose them. We must be prepared to oppose and defeat them. In
                            order to prevent their making such a rash move, they must be made to
                            understand that we will not tolerate a Soviet military takeover of the
                            Congo.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he assumed
                            that if the Soviets intervened in the Congo they would do so in
                            opposition to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force. The President
                            said if the Soviets intervened in such circumstances, we would all be in
                            the fight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then called upon Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> who said that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> had gone to
                            the Congo on July 1 and since that time had had the most active job of
                            any U.S. ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> said the
                            situation in the Congo had resulted from the fact that the basic
                            assumptions about the Government of the Congo had not been realized. It
                            had been assumed that Belgians would remain as advisers to the new
                            republic but they did not do so. It had been assumed that the Force
                            Publique would remain loyal to the government but instead the Belgian
                            officers of the Force Publique were dismissed so that a former native
                            sergeant became the commanding <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0404"
                            />general of the Force. The problem now is to attempt to find
                            substitutes for Belgian administrators and technicians who are no longer
                            in the Congo. No one, literally no one, in the Congo knows how to run a
                            government department. The level of education is of course very low. If
                            the problems of the Congo are to be solved, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> has undertaken the largest job in history. One of the
                            difficulties is the fact that the Congo covers a great deal of territory
                            and has very poor communications facilities. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is not anxious to see the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> succeed in the Congo. The President asked how many
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops had arrived on the scene.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> replied
                            11,000 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops were now in the Congo.
                            The President thought this force should be large enough to maintain
                            order. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName>
                            agreed but noted that some time would be required for the restoration of
                            order. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops were presently
                            engaged in a “mop up” operation; they were attempting to get the
                            Congolese troops to behave properly. The President said that when
                            sergeants get to be generals, they are being promoted even faster than
                            he was.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> believed that the
                            Commander of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force was in an
                            extremely difficult position since he could receive his directives only
                            from the Secretary-General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander was in a difficult
                            position and said it would not be easy for him to decide at times
                            whether to carry out the wishes of the Congo Government or of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJHJ1"
                                >Douglas</persName> asked whether there was a clear policy as to the
                            disposition of the Force Publique. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> replied that an effort was
                            being made to bring as many Force Publique troops as possible back into
                            service. It was thought that about 60 per cent of the Force could be
                            rehabilitated. The President thought perhaps the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> should have a training mission in the Congo for the
                            purpose of rehabilitating the Force Publique. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> agreed but pointed out that
                            relations between the Government of the Congo and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were far from clear. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been invited in by the Government of
                            the Congo and presumably could be invited out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> referred to Basic National
                            Security Policy which provided that economic development aid, as
                            distinct from technical assistance, would not be provided through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He asked whether economic
                            development assistance to the Congo was contemplated. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said no economic
                            development aid was contemplated at the present time. We were planning
                            only technical assistance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> added that we intend to give budgetary assistance
                            through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in order that the Congo
                            could pay the technicians which it badly needs. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the adequacy of this
                            year’s Contingency Funds had been raised and he would like to talk to
                            the President about this question after the meeting.</p>

                            announced the dispatch of a second shipload of assistance to the Congo,
                            asked whether this was another occasion when the Soviets would render a
                            small amount of aid, say 100 trucks, but would receive the greatest
                            amount of publicity. He hoped that U.S. aid going to the Congo via the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be identifiable as U.S. aid
                            in some way. The President said we might paint our vehicles red, white
                            and blue. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said
                            that so far our airlift had been our big contribution. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> said the Soviet
                            assistance so far had been mostly in the form of food, which had been
                            added to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> food pool. He added that
                            the food problem in the Congo was easing so that it was not now
                            considered critical in the short-range.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President left the meeting.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said he was
                            concerned about the possibility that the Soviets would introduce a great
                            many technicians into the Congo. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1"
                                >Timberlake</persName> said there were not many Soviet technicians
                            there at the time he left.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> wished to make
                            two further remarks about the Congo. First, we have suggested to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that it should make an agreement
                            with the Congo giving it the exclusive right to furnish all necessary
                            technicians. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had agreed to try
                            this plan and we had agreed to provide all our technicians through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Second, a group working in the
                            State Department had spotted all the key places in the Government of the
                            Congo in which we would prefer not to have Soviet technicians placed. We
                            will try to have our own technicians in these positions or at least
                            prevent their being filled by Soviet technicians. [<hi rend="italic">1

                            briefly before Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1"
                                >Timberlake</persName> left the meeting. He noted that the <gloss

                            integrated and dependable force. For <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                                facs="0406"/>example, the Guinea troops had been told that they were
                            going to the Congo for the purpose of shooting Belgians. They were also
                            told that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort in the Congo was
                            an example of multilateral colonialism. In response to a question, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said it was the Government of Guinea
                            which had told the Guinean troops they were to shoot Belgians in the
                            Congo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought
                            this episode was probably the result of the large number of communists

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> then raised the
                            question of need for funds for operations in the Congo. He said it is
                            anybody’s guess as to what the total need will be. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said these funds apparently must
                            come from the contingency fund, which is now set by the Congress at $150
                            million for the year, of which $20 million has already been committed
                            for Chile. A very broad estimate of overall expenditures would be in the
                            order of $200 million for the total operations in the Congo, including
                            troop pay, technicians, and other activities. Our share may be somewhere
                            in the neighborhood of $100 million. The President said he saw nothing
                            to do but to go to the Congress and ask to have the contingency fund
                            increased by $100 million, earmarking it for the Congo, so as not to
                            invite others to try to get these funds. Mr. Reid said this is a concern
                            which Budget has—that if the funds were not used for the Congo, others
                            would try to get them. At the same time we do not want to give the Congo
                            Government any claim that the money is “theirs.” The President thought
                            that a provision that the President must find the expenditures necessary
                            in the U.S. interest in each case would be helpful. He would support a
                            request for the $100 million for special needs (not necessarily limited
                            to the Congo, although privately intended almost entirely therefor). He
                            does not simply want to raise the ante of requests all around.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that in the last twelve months the world has
                            developed a kind of ferment greater than he could remember in recent
                            times. The Communists are trying to take control of this, and have
                            succeeded to the extent that students in many cases are now saying that
                            the Communists are thinking of the common man while the United States is
                            dedicated to supporting outmoded regimes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB3">Anderson</persName>, referring to
                            the anticipated costs of operations in the Congo, said that we want to
                            push the Soviets very hard to make them carry a fair and full share of
                            the burden. The President said he would like to see the Soviets called
                            on to put in just as much as we do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said that Hammarskjold is trying to keep the
                            Congo expenditures within the structure of his regular budget system and
                                <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0408"/>allocation of national

                            observed that the Soviets are getting themselves into the position where
                            they are obstructing and opposing the United Nations with regard to
                            activity in the Congo.</p>

                            cold war competition but observed Congolese sensitive to limitations on
                            sovereignty such as exclusive aid arranged even with U.N. might imply.

                            convince Congo overcome this sensitivity since obviously Africans

                        <p>“As Ambassador Halm has doubtless reported to you, the State Department
                            has been keeping in touch with African Ambassadors here on the rapidly
                            changing situation in the Congo. We are agreed that this situation is
                            unique and that, while it presents grave dangers to world peace, it is
                            also a great challenge to statesmanship and an opportunity for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in general and African states in
                            particular. If this challenge can be successfully met I feel that the
                            world may be able to enter on a new stage of interdependence and healthy
                            development.</p>
                        <p>We are also agreed that the immediate problem is the speedy resolution of
                            the Belgian troop and Katanga questions. I am convinced that <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> Hammarskjold, though hampered by strong
                            conflicting pressures and passions, is doing his best to carry out his
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mandate. In this effort the US is
                            backing and supporting him to the hilt, not only because we believe that
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution is the right one, but
                            also because we feel that if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were
                            unsuccessful or discredited in the Congo, the results for world peace
                            and cooperation would be disastrously tragic.</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0410"/>
                        <p>Important as are these immediate problems, I believe we should start
                            looking beyond them to the situation which will exist after they are
                            solved. The Congo will, I fear, have almost no trained experienced
                            personnel to administer the country and operate the economy. This puts
                            the Congo, it seems to us, in a position unique amongst all newly
                            independent countries. It will be forced for a period of a few years at
                            least, to entrust the country’s essential services to outsiders. In this
                            situation it seems vital to me that the Congo be effectively protected
                            against conflicting power politics or other pressures which could not
                            but have an unfortunate effect on its healthy, harmonious and
                            independent development. Our first thought was that this protection
                            might be provided by means of a contract between the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Congolese Government under which
                            the former would be the exclusive agent for the supply of
                            administrative, technical and financial assistance to the latter. As
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> told Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> last week, the US
                            is prepared to contribute its fair share to this common effort.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> and I would greatly appreciate the benefit of an
                            exchange of views with you. I am therefore asking my Ambassador to the
                            Congo, The Honorable <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Clare H.
                                Timberlake</persName>, to stop at Accra to see you, probably on
                            August 5. He has been back in Washington on consultation for a few days
                            during which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            and I have discussed the Congo situation with him fully. He has my full

                            quite frankly your thoughts on this urgent problem.”<note n="1"

                        <p>DEAR CHRIS: I returned to Brussels yesterday and hasten to thank you for
                            all the time and trouble you took to consider Belgian problems during my
                            visit to Washington.</p>
                        <p>I know what a difficult position you have, to be in charge of United
                            States foreign policy, in endeavoring to build a position for the West
                            in Africa, keep the Russians out of key African countries, and at the
                            same time not do too much damage to our relationship with our <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> structure itself.</p>
                        <p>It is inevitable in a situation like the present that the emergency
                            nature of the Congo crisis should cause most problems to be considered
                            primarily from the Congo point of view. I took this position myself
                            during the early months of my service in Brussels and devoted a very
                            large part of my time, as you know to developing plans to anticipate
                            some of the critical problems which we thought likely to emerge,
                            particularly financial ones. However, I think the pendulum has now swung
                            too much in the Congo direction and we must give full consideration to
                            the very serious damage which our actions are causing to Belgo-American
                            relations and to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole. I am
                            sure Larry Norstad<note n="1" xml:id="d161fn1">General Lauris Norstad,
                                    <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, Supreme Allied Commander
                                in Europe.</note> has talked to you about the latter.</p>
                        <p>I am of course prepared to take any action here which is necessary to
                            United States policy, no matter how unpalatable it is to the Belgians
                            but I do want to be sure that the possible effect on Belgium and on
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has been fully considered
                            before it is taken, and I will, of course, always draw such possible
                            effects to your attention. I am sure that continued problems of this
                            nature will arise because of the inevitable dichotomy of trying to do as
                            much as possible in Africa without too much damage in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I think there is much too much of a tendency to meet all
                            Hammarskjold’s demands, no matter how unreasonable, and for the United
                            States to be willing to make unilateral representations with the
                            Belgians and elsewhere in Europe without any assurance that we will be
                            backed up by the British and French. This has already happened twice and
                            I hope it won’t happen again. When it does, the British and French
                            either back the Belgians or abstain, and the blame all falls on us. Nor
                            do I think that we will achieve success by meeting <hi rend="italic"
                                >all</hi> of the demands of the Congolese rapidly and at the cost of

                            I explained in Washington, will only result in more and more
                            unreasonable demands, and there are limits to what we should do.</p>
                        <p>I know that no one is more fully aware of the importance of our European
                            relationships than you, and that you have a special soft spot in your
                            heart for Brussels, because of your prior service here.<note n="2"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> said that he
                            wished to outline in detail the agreement which had been reached between
                            the Belgian Government and Secretary <persName>General</persName>
                            Hammarskjold in Brussels. He said that the Belgian Government had
                            informed the Secretary <persName>General</persName> again that they were
                            prepared to implement the Security Council resolution including the
                            withdrawal of forces from Katanga. The Belgians had added that
                            Hammarskjold could use this information in his negotiations with
                            Tshombe. Furthermore Hammarskjold had undertaken to negotiate with the
                            Belgians regarding assurances to the white population of the Katanga.
                            The Belgian Government felt that it had carried out its understanding
                            with Hammarskjold in every detail but that the latter had violated this
                            agreement by issuing a statement regarding Mr. <persName

                                Katanga on August 6, and that the withdrawal of Belgian troops was

                                >Scheyven</persName> said that the Belgians feel they have been
                            abused and Hammarskjold had not acted properly. The schedule which he
                            had set up did not provide any time for meaningful negotiations between
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> and the Katanga
                            authorities and indicated he would send troops in regardless of the
                            outcome of these negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> continued,
                            saying that the effect of Hammarskjold’s action had been extremely bad
                            on the 23,000 whites who lived in the Katanga and who held its economy
                            together. Eighty percent of the white population had been at work until
                            the receipt of Hammarskjold’s statement but it was feared that this
                            would change the situation. He continued, saying that the Secretary
                                <persName>General</persName> had not respected the deal which he had
                            made in Brussels. He added it was realized that the Secretary
                                <persName>General</persName> was under strong pressure from
                            extremists in the Congo and from the left-wing elements in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> Government. The Belgians had
                            concluded that Hammarskjold was following the line of least resistance
                            in order to make his mission a success. He concurred that this mission
                            must succeed but was concerned by the growth of Communist influence in
                            Leopoldville.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> then said that
                            Hammarskjold had apparently taken stock of the situation and had
                            concluded that Belgium would be forced to cooperate by events. However,
                            he had not carried out the spirit of the agreement reached. The Belgians
                            feel that the way the Secretary <persName>General</persName> has acted
                            and has appeared to succumb to leftist pressure in Leopoldville in fact
                            is consolidating <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            position. The Belgians feel that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> should go immediately (in fact he had already
                            departed) to the Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> added that the
                            Belgian position was that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should
                            not by its operations give advantage to any one party in the political
                            dispute in the Congo. He said it was realized that Hammarskjold said
                            that the position of the Katanga Government was nonexistent and that
                            they did not have a right to secede. He said under these ground rules
                            Belgium would have never been born at all since Belgium had similarly
                            seceded from the Netherlands in 1830. A juridical approach by the
                            Secretary <persName>General</persName> might be politically wrong. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not be any party to the
                            internal conflict in the Congo.</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0418"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> said that the
                            dispatch of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops to Katanga might
                            lead to disturbances and might also provide a facade for leftist
                            agitators from Leopoldville to proceed to that Province. He stressed
                            again that the Katanga was actually a going concern and that there was
                            no famine there as elsewhere. With regard to Belgian technicians,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> noted, the
                            Secretary-General said their maintenance in Congo was a Belgian
                            responsibility but that Belgium cannot accept this responsibility if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops go into Katanga without
                            satisfactory guarantees having been provided for the 23,000 whites in
                            the Province. He said that Belgium had appealed to these men to remain
                            but the memories of the earlier atrocities were fresh in their minds so
                            that it was difficult to convince them that they should stay. He
                            admitted that the mobilization of Katanga forces might not amount to
                            much and repeated the Belgian troops would certainly not oppose <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces on their arrival. He also
                            mentioned the tribal problem in the area.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> went on,
                            saying that the Belgian Government wished to underline the dangers
                            existing in the situation and the importance of developing Western
                            counterpressures on Hammarskjold to counterbalance the left-wing element
                            influences exerted through the Congolese Government. There should be
                            influence from Belgium’s friends on Hammarskjold to keep out agitators
                            from Leopoldville in Katanga. He said it would be extremely difficult to
                            solve this problem in 48 hours and that we could only hope that the
                            entry of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces would be peaceful. He
                            said that Belgium hoped that white troops would be sent to the area by
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but noted that the Congolese
                            wanted black troops so the result would probably be that they would be
                            mixed. The Secretary said that he understood the forces would in fact be
                            Irish, Swedish, Tunisian and Moroccan.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> repeated that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not become involved in any
                            way in the internal politics of the Congo since this would be beyond the
                            mandate of the Security Council. He thought that Hammarskjold agreed
                            with the Belgian interpretation of the Security Council resolution in
                            this respect but might give in to Congolese pressure. He said that he
                            hoped the United States would tell Hammarskjold that we felt he should
                            not interfere in internal Congolese politics. With regard to the 23,000
                            whites in the area the Belgians hoped that we would express concern
                            regarding their security. He thought this was of paramount importance
                            and he noted that Katanga produced at least 60 percent of the riches of
                            the Congo and if this area went to pieces like the rest of the country
                            and the whites should leave the results would be catastrophic. He noted
                            that only some 100 out of 5,000 whites were left in Stanleyville.</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0419"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if there were dangers of tribal war in Katanga. The
                            Ambassador said that thus far there had been no outbreaks of this nature
                            but there had been some in the Kasai province. However Tshombe might
                            stir up difficulties and he thought that most of the tribes in Katanga
                            were on his side.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> repeated that
                            it was his view that the Western powers should now adopt a strong
                            position. There might be actual hostilities within 48 hours in the only
                            province where order had reigned. There might be fights also between
                            Katanga and Congolese Government forces. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> then passed to the question of
                            the motives of the Ghana and Guinea Governments. He said that Ghana had,
                            on August 1, said in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that Belgium
                            should be treated as an aggressor and Guinea had taken a similar line.
                            The Secretary said we had sent our Ambassador to Ghana on his way back
                            to Leopoldville to attempt to get the Ghanaians off of this line and
                            also to ask them to exert their influence in the right way with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. The Secretary did not
                            think we could have much influence with Guinea but thought that perhaps
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1">Tubman</persName> might be able
                            to exert some moderating influence on Sekou Toure and that we were
                            planning to approach President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1"
                                >Tubman</persName> in this sense.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2"

                            Soviet attitudes in Congo made in the Security Council<note n="3"

                            had been very good and he hoped that we could make a similar approach to
                            Ghana and Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that we were indeed planning to do what we could
                            with these two countries. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1"
                                >Scheyven</persName> said would this be in the sense of asking them
                            to exert a restraining influence on <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>? The Secretary replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> continued
                            saying that this was a crucial moment. He said that either the Western
                            powers would have to take a firm position or the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> mission would fail and the result would be catastrophic
                            and chaos favorable to Communist infiltration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Hammarskjold’s decision regarding sending troops
                            to Katanga had been taken in the atmosphere of Leopoldville. He thought
                            with <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> having gone to
                            Elisabethville he might now have a different appreciation of the
                            situation after having been on the spot. He was convinced that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> authorities would wish to avoid
                            extreme positions. The Secretary agreed that there would be chaos if the
                            whites were to leave Katanga. He repeated that it was difficult to take
                            firm positions when we were so far away from the situation. The
                            Secretary repeated that it was his understanding Hammarskjold <pb
                                n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0420"/>was keeping hands off
                            politically in the Congo. He agreed also that Hammarskjold should not
                            take any firm position on the final determination of the Congo state as
                            to whether it should be a centralized state or a looser federation. On
                            the other hand he wondered if we wanted Hammarskjold to stay out of
                            Congo politics entirely. For example, it might be helpful if he were to
                            take what steps he could to strengthen moderate elements in
                            Leopoldville. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName>
                            said would we approach Hammarskjold in the sense of asking him to remain
                            outside of Congolese politics? The Secretary said we would have to think
                            about that and in any case we did not wish to do anything which would
                            weaken Hammarskjold in carrying out his mission. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> asked if we would approach
                            Hammarskjold on his other point of expressing concern regarding the
                            safety of the white population of Katanga. The Secretary said we would
                            be delighted to do this and he did not see any problem in expressing our
                            concern for the safety and security of the white population.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> finally asked
                            if we would make a démarche to the Congolese regarding their declaration
                            that they would seize Belgian businesses, which had been closed, unless
                            they were reopened within eight days. The Secretary said he thought it
                            would be difficult for the Congolese to seize Belgian interests in
                            Katanga especially in view of the presence of Belgian troops and asked
                            what the Congolese would do with these businesses anyway. The Ambassador
                            said they would keep them permanently. The Secretary said he would
                            consider the Ambassador’s request and let him know.</p>

                        <p>Dear President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, I am
                            happy to receive your letter through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_FWC1">Flake</persName>. I appreciate the way in which
                            the State Department has been keeping in touch with the Ambassadors of
                            the independent African states in regard to the situation in Congo. I
                            agree with you when you say that though the present situation presents
                            dangers to world peace, it is also a great challenge to statesmanship
                            and an opportunity for the United Nations in general and African states
                            in particular.</p>
                        <p>Like you I believe that the most immediate problem is the speedy
                            withdrawal of Belgian troops from the whole of the Congo, including
                            Katanga. So far as Katanga is concerned, any attempt to detach it from
                            the Congo state in anybody’s interest will have the most disastrous
                            consequences not only upon African opinion, but upon the whole balance
                            of political forces in the world. This is a point which I have tried to
                            emphasize both in public and in private.</p>
                        <p>It is quite clear that the separatist movement in Katanga has not got
                            popular support but is the product of Belgian manoeuvres in the Congo.
                            What worries me most is the failure to act quickly in the implementation
                            of the United Nations resolution. I must say that if any power was not
                            clearly to oppose Belgium in her present conduct, the position of that
                            power on the African continent would be fatally compromised.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me therefore, that the first step is to establish the
                            authority of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>There is a suspicion, which I would like to believe is quite unfounded,
                            that the United States of America, France and the United Kingdom are not
                            giving their full support to the United Nations decision that all
                            Belgian troops should be withdrawn from the whole of the Congo. The view
                            which is being taken by some African states is that these powers are
                            deliberately delaying on this issue in the hope that a Katanga state can
                            be created and that the Belgian military occupation can continue and be
                            ultimately justified on a de facto basis.</p>
                        <p>I am glad indeed to note your proposal that Congo should be protected
                            against conflicting power politics and other pressures. However, the
                            first task before any other issue can be considered is the withdrawal of
                            all Belgian troops.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, in order that the matter of technical assistance can be
                            discussed concurrently with the question of the withdrawal of Belgian
                            troops from the Congo, my Government is addressing a note to your
                            Ambassador here on this aspect of the matter.<note n="2"

                            question of Katanga not root of problem; (b) report leaves Katanga free
                            work out future status with Congolese Government; and (c) report clearly
                            assures Tshombe of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> impartial role and
                            that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force will not take sides in

                            with appropriate assurances for Tshombe which we believe would soften

                            forces in Katanga. We believe Africans will be unhappy with <gloss

                        <p>Principal key to situation in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, as we
                            see it, is question of Belgian withdrawal from entire Congo, including
                            Katanga and bases. We believe that forthright statement of intentions by
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> before or early in
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> proceedings would pull rug out
                            from Soviets and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Two
                            principal ways in which this could be achieved: (a) paragraph in
                            resolution calling for withdrawal of Belgian forces from entire Congo,
                            including Katanga bases, within specific time limit; (b) paragraph in
                            resolution taking note of whatever statement <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> makes re withdrawal of forces. Latter is clearly
                            best way since it avoids appearance of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            pressuring Belgians. Belgian initiative in this regard would clearly
                            improve their posture, it would be added evidence of their cooperation
                            with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and it would indicate
                            willingness to carry out <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution as
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> takes control of Congo. In our
                            judgment, for maximum effectiveness, Belgian withdrawal statement must
                            clearly apply to both Katanga and bases. With respect to latter, we have
                            already put to Belgians suggestion that they turn over bases to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Should Belgium be able to make
                            forthright statement which would be reflected in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> res, we believe it would be much more difficult for
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to veto resolution or justify

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> saw Hammarskjold late
                            this afternoon (our first direct communication with <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> since his arrival from Leopoldville).
                            After listening to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s description of
                            situation in Congo and especially Katanga, it was clear he saying
                            presence Belgian troops Katanga was real issue. We asked him if this was
                            case. He affirmed it emphatically and specifically, although in his
                            written report he had decided play it differently.</p>
                        <p>2. As for res to be passed at next <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            meeting, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said Belgian troops must
                            leave Katanga and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must enter to assure
                            safety of lives and property. To do these things Tshombe must allow
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entry. Tshombe concerned for his
                            personal safety and position if Belgian troops withdraw and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> moves in. This line of reasoning, <gloss

                            must contain fol four points: (a) affirm <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>’s two previous res’s; (b) specifically call for <gloss

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> read from several cables, first

                                >Bunche</persName> said he had concluded situation could only be
                            saved, if at all, by immediate withdrawal of all Belgian troops, with
                            emphasis on immediate. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>
                            acknowledged this would run risk of panic exodus by Belgians from
                            Katanga and produce disorder there; but he expressed view such a risk
                            must be taken in order pull rug out from under extremists among

                                >Bunche</persName> said otherwise <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            force could not hang on in Congo. It would soon incur hostility of local
                            population and would disintegrate, some elements withdrawing and some,
                            in effect, going into service of Congo Govt against Belgium.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> agreed with necessity for Belgian

                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said his move on Friday to call

                        <p>6. Reverting to his decision on August 2 to move into Katanga, <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> reported <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had ordered <persName corresp="#p_GA4"

                            made to Katanga. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he therefore
                            had no way in which to maneuver to play for time. Moreover, he said,
                            moderates and radicals in cabinet, for different reasons, all took line
                            opposing delay by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He added that

                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that as of last Tuesday he

                                >Gizenga</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            had been scheduled to arrive on Thursday. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> believed <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName>
                            would try steal <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s fire by

                            comment very unusual for him: he said his decision also influenced by
                            news which reached him of “systematic action by Soviet agents to
                            sabotage <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation”. He concluded by
                            saying he felt he had act in order avoid “a kind of Korea”.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> then turned to Katanga. He read
                            from highly confidential report from Linner<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2"
                                >Sture Linner, chief of U.N. civilian operations in the

                            community. August 4 Linner met with 25 officials of business community,
                            including head of Union Miniere. This group greeted him with “curses,
                            spat upon him and called him a criminal”. They said arrival of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops would signal departure by whites
                            as well as Congolese business personnel and economic collapse would
                            come. They claimed “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trying to take
                            Katanga” for other Western interests. Linner reported he told them
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical assistance would not
                            mean replacement of Belgians. In fact, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            anxious that Belgians remain to keep economy going. Linner also
                            explained general basis on which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            operated. This first meeting lasted 4 hours.</p>
                        <p>9. Later during night Linner said all but four of group with whom he had
                            met came to him in private to say that they were under orders from

                            and be put in jail. They reported also that Tshombe was not politically
                            strong but was maintained by money he received. They reported that
                            several days earlier arrangements had been made to blow up some of

                        <p>10. Linner said at subsequent meetings colons had come around to
                            acquiescence in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> arrival; however, on
                            August 5 when <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plane approached airport

                            officers in plain clothes which Belgians themselves had requested,
                            Belgian officer manned machine guns on airport roof to prevent aircraft
                            from landing. When through Bundle’s efforts plane was allowed to land,
                            passengers were kept inside plane. (<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            commented that keeping men closed up in plane on ground without
                            ventilation threatened their lives.) Linner reported he had remarked to
                            Belgian officer that 25 lives were at stake if plane had been shot down
                            or if they died from sitting in closed airplane on airfield; Belgian’s

                        <p>11. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> gives weight and credence to
                            report of Linner whom he has known for long time and whom he considered
                            particularly acceptable to Belgian mining interests in Katanga since
                            Linner is Swede who has worked for large mining interests in Liberia. He

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> out.</p>
                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> then told story of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>’s activity at time <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plane arrived at Elisabethville airport
                            Friday morning. His account fit with that in press, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> being confronted with obstacles
                            at airport and arranging only at last minute to get permission for plane
                            to land.</p>
                        <p>13. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he had confronted <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> this morning with as much as he
                            thought he could repeat of report by Linner as well as of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>’s experience. He said he
                            emphasized that Belgian civilians on spot badly misinformed about <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Belgian officers in Force Publique
                            accepting orders from Katanga authorities against <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and in apparent disregard of official Belgian policy. He
                            told <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> he believed Belgium was
                            not responsible for instigating what had been done in Katanga. But he
                            did hold Belgium responsible for not preventing what had been done by
                            local people. He told <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> “You
                            have the power to change the views” in Katanga.</p>
                        <p>14. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> summarized by referring to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>’s recommendation for
                            immediate total Belgian withdrawal as “next step”. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> reaffirmed that it was desperately
                            necessary to get <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops into Katanga
                            at once along with urgent Belgian withdrawal. Steps must be taken to
                            break Tshombe’s resistance to arrival of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops. For that reason, and also because Tshombe
                            understandably did not want to be under dictation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, Hammarskjold had reached
                            conclusion necessary for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to find way
                            to guarantee Tshombe’s right to speak and escape imprisonment or
                            assassination. In response to our query, <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said he thought this could be accomplished through some
                            kind of provision in res to be passed by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>. Such provision should provide <pb n="399"

                                >UN</gloss> to provide guarantees and stand up against <persName

                            “getting” Tshombe.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">Before he left the Congo,

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> began by expressing his

                                Belgian withdrawal from Katanga “at the earliest moment under
                                arrangements to be worked out by the Secretary-General for the

                            events during days preceding and immediately following arrival of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces. Main points all stressed were
                            that Congo had no desire for Belgians to leave, but cycle of fear and
                            panic had started during which Belgians fled even when they were not in
                            any danger. In this connection Mpolo referred to case Coquilhatville
                            when Congolese civilian went to airport as Belgians leaving, asking why
                            they were going. Impression of Congolese was Belgians acting under
                            orders.</p>
                        <p>3. Most significant and hopeful part of conversation began when Kanza
                            said military aspect of Congolese problem soon be passed. However, it
                            was necessary begin at once to deal with financial and technical
                            problems.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> and Kanza both urged us
                            try to convince Belgians they should counteract “mauvaise propagande”
                            which threatened in Katanga. Belgians were in best position dispel fear
                            which Europeans in Katanga felt for their future once Belgian troops
                            left. They said Belgians in Katanga must be made realize that arrival of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is solely to preserve order, and
                            will not result in persecuting whites. Both stressed dependence of
                            Katanga economy on Belgians and strong desire of Congolese that Belgian
                            administrators and technicians remain. If propaganda now believed by
                            Belgians there was not counteracted, economy of province would be
                            destroyed.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> then referred to
                            economic conditions in Leopoldville. He stressed need to get economic
                            life in Leopoldville going again. He said Belgians who have fled should
                            return to their economic affairs. Those remaining should open their
                            shops and their businesses again. He drew distinction between Congolese
                            attitude toward particular Belgian Govt now in office and individual
                            Belgians. He said present Belgian actions in Leopoldville amount to kind
                            of economic sanction and seemed to be taken from spirit of vengeance.
                            They have taken the control of central banking to Brussels along with
                            gold, and now refuse to open their places of business so that economic
                            life can return to normal.</p>
                        <p>5. Both <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> and Kanza, with
                            apparent acquiescence of all but impassive <persName corresp="#p_GA4"
                                >Gizenga</persName>, stressed that paralysis of economic life was in
                            no one’s interest. They made official request: Soon as order is
                            established, Congolese want to work with Belgians on economic matters.
                            They asked us to tell Belgians they should start conversations now
                            rather than take funds to Belgium, which could only create bitterness.
                            They also asked that we make appeal to Belgium that they support <gloss

                            horrified there was no reference to maintenance of law and order in

                        <p>2. I told <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> that those in

                            search their consciences on this point because consequences of misstep
                            could bring about another Korea and make present state of affairs in

                        <p>3. I said that reference to law and order in pending res was superfluous.
                            I called <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>’s attention to

                            pointed out that in res of 22 July restoration of law and order is

                            stated that operative para 2 spoke of “modalities determined by <gloss

                        <p>5. I ended conversation by asking <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> to consider carefully what I had said to him and I
                            repeated my admonition that Belgium carried heavy responsibility for
                            success or failure of this res. I agreed to consider carefully what he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>6. A few minutes later Beeley (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>)
                            informed us <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> (Belgium) had
                            taken same position with Dixon on necessity to cause Ceylonese-Tunisian

                            with <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>. Beeley said Belgians
                            were attempting to cause res to fail by trying to organize sufficient
                            abstentions or by trying to obtain French veto. [<hi rend="italic">2

                        <p>7. Beeley said he did not believe they could obtain enough abstentions
                            and they could not obtain French veto. Asked if <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> would abstain, Beeley said he did not think they would
                            in the last analysis.</p>
                        <p>8. Beeley said in order to get over this problem Dixon had decided to ask
                            question of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> on how he foresaw
                            working out of “modalities” as referred to in res and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would make reply referring to law and
                            order which would be satisfactory. He thought this might solve
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>9. Beeley said failure of res and consequent failure of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort would result in consequences which
                            would be so serious that everything had to be done to avoid this

                            gave Fon Min Wigny letter in which he proposed, if there were any
                            difficulties or gap before he could introduce <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops into Katanga, to incorporate Belgian troops
                            Katanga into <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force as temporary

                                >Wigny</persName> said he could not give Hammarskjold answer without
                            referring whole question to cabinet for decision. Wieschhoff described
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>’s mood as “very mellow”.
                            (Dutch <gloss target="#t_Del1">Del</gloss> today confirmed this
                            assessment Belgian temperament, saying they understood, without knowing
                            any details, that Belgians were extremely satisfied with way situation
                            developed since <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting.)</p>
                        <p>4. This morning Hammarskjold called in Congolese <gloss target="#t_Del1"
                                >Del</gloss> and told them of his intention, as set out in his
                            second cable to Tshombe, to go on to Katanga. He did not give them
                            details. He did make it very clear that he regarded Katanga as special
                            problem which was so recognized by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and
                            that he would brook no interference in this regard. He intended deal
                            with Tshombe directly and would not take rep of central government with
                            him on Friday when he goes in. Congolese Vice Premier <persName

                            “swallowed hard” but took this without protest.</p>
                        <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0434"/>
                        <p>5. Hammarskjold thus has completed, with Congolese and Belgians,
                            preparations for next step. He realizes that his next problem will be
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Wieschhoff expressed
                            personal view that in long run it would not be harmful if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> were to try to interfere with
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s plan for Katanga, thus
                            precipitating test of strength with those who oppose him. (Wieschhoff
                            mentioned Ileo, Bolikango, Kalonji,<note n="5" xml:id="d170fn5">Jean
                                Bolikango, leader of the <hi rend="italic">Parti de l’Unité

                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.) Wieschhoff believes <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would now lose such struggle and
                            it would have result of weakening or destroying his role in govt.</p>
                        <p>6. In order to keep <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> (Ghana)
                            in line, Hammarskjold has sent him cable indicating his (<gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s) trip to Leopoldville includes 15
                            minute refueling stop Accra. He has asked <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> if it would be possible to come to airport for
                            brief “exchange of views” on current situation while plane being
                            refueled. In fact, plane will be spending much longer time in Accra
                            according to present schedule, but if <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> knew this he would try to have Hammarskjold come
                            into city for meeting at Presidential Palace. Hammarskjold feels
                            psychology would be all wrong if that were to take place, hence his
                            subterfuge on time available. (Wieschhoff said <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> originally dictated telegram to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> suggesting meeting “to discuss
                            our differences”. Wieschhoff said he felt this too strong and proposed
                            phrase “exchange of views” on situation. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> accepted this suggestion.)</p>
                        <p>7. Hammarskjold due to arrive Leopldville Thursday night. After breakfast
                            Friday morning he plans to fly on to Elisabethville according schedule
                            set out above. He anticipates “talks” with Tshombe will only last one
                            day. By Sunday Hammarskjold expects to be able to call in first large
                            complement troops for Katanga. (He regards 250 Swedes in first group as
                            “token” only.) These will consist of Irish, Moroccan, and more Swedish
                            troops. Perhaps later he will bring in Ethiopians.</p>
                        <p>8. Hammarskjold plans return Leopoldville Monday, August 15 to begin
                            negotiation on disposition of bases, pursuant provisions in Friendship
                            Treaty. To do this he intends be party to negotiations between Belgians
                            and Congolese and to initial eventual agreement on disposition. He hopes
                            according to Wieschhoff to be third party to agreement, with outcome
                            being delegation of authority for control of bases from Belgians and
                            Congolese to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He proposes that these
                            negotiations be carried out in Leopoldville and that Belgian diplomatic
                            and military representatives come there for that purpose. He has already
                            informed both Belgians and Congolese of intention have negotiations
                            there. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> anticipates these
                            negotiations will take approximately one week.</p>

                            support for his efforts. They merely wished to reserve right to express

                            almost everything has been reported in the press. He said that he had
                            had a telephone call from Mr. Hammarskjold just before he left the U.S.
                            in which he expressed his thanks to the Secretary of Defense for
                            expediting his own transportation and for the troop airlift. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that we had got
                            over one hurdle in the Congo for the time being but that the trouble was
                            not over by any means. The Vice President observed that there had been a
                            superb handling of the Congo situation. The President remarked that the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> mentioned the
                            question which had been considered previously of sending U.S. troops and
                            the decision against sending our troops because of the danger of a
                            possible clash with the Soviet troops. He said that the same problem was
                            present in the case of U.S. technicians who might be competing with
                            Soviet technicians with a possible conflict resulting and explained that
                            that reasoning lay behind the decision to use the medium of the <gloss

                            the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia has offered to print currency for the

                            scholarships where the U.S. had made a unilateral offer. He said that
                            300 scholarships had been offered and that so far 800 applications had

                        <p>401. Events of past week lead me to believe there will shortly be
                            political showdown between <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            and his followers and elements in the opposition to him. Regional groups
                            have been talking more insistently in favor of decentralization of
                            authority and several of outright secession. We believe that the
                            principal motive behind them is opposition to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s policies and fear that he is moving toward a
                            dictatorship which will submerge their interests. Thus far such
                            opposition is inchoate and has expended its energies in relatively
                            fruitless pursuits such as issuing manifestoes and directing appeals to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to support their regional causes.
                            In discussions with leaders who have approached Embassy Officers we have
                            emphasized:</p>
                        <p>1. Provisional constitution provides legal remedies if they are
                            dissatisfied with present government;</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is not a world government which
                            could or would act to change the government of the Congo or any other
                            government;</p>
                        <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0438"/>
                        <p>3. World opinion and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would find it
                            difficult if not impossible to accept a change of government brought
                            about by violent means as some have suggested. We have added that in
                            democratic countries if the opposition to a government is united and
                            determined, it can vote that government out of office which is one of
                            the greatest advantages of the democratic form. The arrest yesterday of

                                >Dated August 12. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> which would
                            in effect set up courts-martial, require the short-term licensing of
                            Congolese periodicals and imports of foreign periodicals and limit the
                            right of public assembly are rather clear indications that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is moving steadily toward a very
                            strong dictatorship. None of us doubt that he will establish a
                            dictatorship if he can get away with it.</p>
                        <p>I feel certain world opinion, which is still in sharp focus on the Congo,
                            will be a strong deterrent. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence
                            here will inevitably be involved and the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> will very likely be seized one way or the other with
                            such an issue.</p>
                        <p>Soviet policy, so far as we can measure it here, seems to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and the unity of the
                            Congo largely because they believe he can be at least manipulated by
                            them in the service of their own objective of obtaining a prominent
                            influence in the management of the Congo. It is quite possible that
                            should <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> fail and more
                            moderate elements win out, the Soviets might well change their present
                            policy and work toward the fragmentation of the Congo in the hope they
                            might obtain control of one or more of the fragments.</p>
                        <p>Belgian policy seems to have favored the separation of the Katanga and
                            quite possibly of other regions and we have some evidence, albeit not
                            conclusive, that this is still being pushed by some Belgian
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>I believe our general policy of support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> effort and the legitimate government of the Congo is
                            correct. As I understand it, it would of course permit the legitimate
                            change of the form of the constitution and government provided this were
                            to be accomplished by legal means as provided in the present
                            constitution and represents the will of the people of the Congo. I have
                            grave doubts however whether this possibility is not being seriously
                            compromised by the direction which <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is taking. If he is able within the near future
                            to weld together enough fragments of the <gloss target="#t_FP1"
                                >FP</gloss>, as he is now trying to do, this could become an
                            important personal weapon to intimidate his opponents and support his
                            bid for dictatorship.</p>
                        <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0439"/>
                        <p>I feel therefore that we should be particularly careful to avoid public
                            expressions which might strengthen <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s position or the announcement of policies which
                            might help him to achieve his apparent ambition. Where we can do so
                            discreetly, it would seem to me good policy to strengthen those
                            moderates who might be a restraining influence at the least and might be
                            expected to replace him, under the most favorable circumstances, with a
                            government much nearer the middle of the road.</p>
                        <p>It is quite possible for the showdown to come within the next week. The
                            Senate is scheduled to reconvene Tuesday August 16 and the <gloss
                                target="#t_Abako1">Abako</gloss>, now even more opposed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> since the <gloss target="#t_FP1"

                            has scheduled a Congress of its leaders for August 13. Much will of
                            course depend upon the degree to which the diverse elements in the Congo
                            can join forces in the pursuit of this one common objective. Their
                            performance and instincts to date do not persuade me to express optimism
                            at this juncture.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>, reads as follows:

                                770G.00/8–1560)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1) <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is moving to left but is
                            probably not firmly Communist-oriented and believes he can play East and
                            West off against each other. In any event it appears doubtful that
                            Soviets, any more than US, could, under present conditions in Congo,
                            establish reliable continuing influence.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>2) <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has demonstrated
                            strength and ability to outmaneuver or intimidate all other Congolese
                            politicians. It is therefore likely that, regardless his titular
                            position, he will continue to play key role in Congolese political life
                            at least over near term.</p>
                        <p>3) Unless checked in near future he is likely progressively to
                            concentrate under his control all effective elements of authority and
                            thus solidify his position as authoritarian strong man. Thus it may
                            follow that as time goes on it will be increasingly difficult for his
                            opponents to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p>4) Important element in deciding whether change of government would be in
                            our interest is consideration of alternatives to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. In addition to absence any
                            apparently effective successor, strengths and abilities Congolese
                            politicians seem to fluctuate, e.g. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>, regarded few months ago as possible rival,
                            seems to have faded from ranks of contenders. Although there is
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> it appears
                            uncoordinated and disorganized both in Parliament and on the street.
                            Moreover it appears unanimously in favor of political structure of
                            confederation, i.e. loosely associated independent states rather than
                            federation of autonomous provinces or states. Such a confederation has
                            many disadvantages, such as vulnerability to Soviet penetration,
                            potentiality for internecine friction or warfare, etc. In addition it is
                            strongly opposed by other Africans who fear for integrity their own
                            states. Therefore if other elements, such as <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s erratic and unreliable character, are not
                            overriding, he can probably count on support of other African states. We
                            believe a situation in which we found ourselves out of sympathy with
                            both <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and most other
                            African states acceptable only in most exigent circumstances.</p>
                        <p>5) Above considerations lead to undesirably negative conclusion that best
                            U.S. course for time being might be to take more or less neutral
                            position toward <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. This does
                            not seem to us however to mean that we must be inactive. We can carry on
                            re-insurance program of cultivating and strengthening potentially
                            effective and friendly rival politicians, attempt to isolate or reform
                            undesirables such as <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> and
                            Kashamura and make efforts to mobilize other African opinion and action
                            along constructive lines.</p>

                            of your Government on the troubled Congo situation which has caused us
                            all such concern.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government and people fully share your desire to see
                            the problems of the Congo settled as rapidly as possible. As you know,
                            we have been requested on several occasions to assist the Government of
                            the Republic of the Congo unilaterally. I believe very strongly,
                            however, that the present crisis in the Congo can be surmounted only
                            through the united efforts of all countries which believe in human
                            freedom and justice, with these efforts coordinated through the United
                            Nations under the effective leadership of Secretary General Dag
                            Hammarskjold. The United States is proud of its role in responding to
                            the appeal from the Secretary General and I am especially gratified that
                            among the troops flown by American planes was the entire Guinean
                            contingent.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the August ninth resolution in the Security Council<note

                            calming the situation in the Congo as a whole. As you know, this
                            resolution called upon the Government of Belgium for the immediate

                            determined by the Secretary General.” The United States voted for this
                            resolution as it has for the others on the same problem, and will
                            continue to support the United Nations effort to the limit of its
                            ability.</p>

                        <p>On August 12, U.N. Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Dag
                                Hammarskjöld</persName> submitted to the Security Council a

                            Council’s August 9 resolution, which reaffirmed that the United Nations
                            Force in the Congo would “not be a party to or in any way intervene in
                            or be used to influence the outcome of any internal conflict,
                            constitutional or otherwise.” The Secretary-General’s interpretation
                            concluded that “the United Nations Force cannot be used on behalf of the
                            central government to subdue or to force the provincial government to a
                            specific line of action”, nor could it be used to assist the central
                            government in subduing the provincial government. For text, see U.N.

                            way to Elisabethville, where he and Moise Tshombé agreed on arrangements
                            for the deployment of U.N. troops to Katanga; the text of a communiqué

                        <p>The Secretary-General returned to Léopoldville on August 14, planning to
                            discuss his talks in Elisabethville with the Congolese Government, but a
                            letter of August 14 from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Patrice Lumumba</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                >Hammarskjöld</persName> rejected his interpretation of the Security
                            Council resolution, accused him of intervening in the conflict between
                            Katanga and the central government, and made a series of demands. Citing
                            the Security Council resolution of July 14, which had authorized the
                            Secretary-General to provide the Congolese Government with military
                            assistance and to do so in consultation with it, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> declared: “It is therefore clear
                            that in its intervention in the Congo the United Nations is not to act
                            as a neutral organization but rather that the Security Council is to
                            place all its resources at the disposal of my <pb n="413"
                                xml:id="pg_413" facs="0443"/>Government.” He requested that
                            Congolese troops take over the task of guarding all airfields in the
                            Congo from U.N. troops, that Congolese troops and troops from the
                            various African contingents in the Congo should be sent immediately to
                            Katanga, that aircraft should be provided to the Congo Government for
                            the purpose of restoring order, that arms and ammunition should be
                            seized from the rebel partisans in Katanga and put at the disposal of
                            the Congo Government, and that all non-African troops should be
                            withdrawn from Katanga. He declared in conclusion that if his government
                            did not “receive satisfaction,” it would be “obliged to take other
                            steps.” For text, see U.N. doc. S/4417/Add.7; also printed in <hi

                                >Lumumba</persName> on August 15, the latter declared that the Congo
                            Government had lost confidence in the Secretary-General and requested
                            that the Security Council send observers representing Morocco, Tunisia,
                            Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Ceylon,

                            ensure the immediate and entire application of the three resolutions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjöld</persName> declared that the

                        <p>228. Following are preliminary views Department re forthcoming <gloss

                        <p>1. Successful outcome this session likely prove of crucial importance for
                            US and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We believe <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> withdrawal from Congo would prove
                            calamitous. Certain result would be chaos in Congo with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> probably turning to <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for help. Further result would be
                            intense cold war struggle for control of area with potential danger of
                            conflict spreading beyond Congo. Thus, in our view, issue is much <pb
                                n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0444"/>broader than fate of Congo
                            alone. Accordingly Dept considers our main objective in <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> must be assure continuation effective
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Congo.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe key to satisfactory outcome lies in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> members, particularly A–A representatives, giving
                            fullest possible support to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Under circumstances we do not think it appropriate for US to take lead
                            in directing course <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> session but should
                            be guided by views of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> as they
                            develop in consultations with Africans.</p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly, Dept believes best posture for <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> is one of quiet but complete support of <gloss

                            Hammarskjold’s interpretation of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res
                            of August 9 that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force cannot be party
                            to or used to influence outcome of internal conflict in Congo. <persName

                        <p>5. Dept also agrees with Hammarskjold’s opposition to withdrawal of

                                that if the non-African contingents were withdrawn, the entire force

                                regionalism,” which contradicted the whole concept of the United

                        <p>The Ambassador said that the three heads of state and the three foreign
                            ministers had discussed the possibility of problems in the Congo long
                            before it became independent. The French had said that the three must
                            concert their policies. When the troubles arose, he had told the
                            Secretary that the three plus Belgium would have to work closely
                            together here in Washington, in New York, and elsewhere. Unfortunately,
                            this had not worked out. The effect in Western Europe has been bad.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary replied that we have had close consultation all
                            along even if we had voted differently in the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>. As for votes, there are occasions in which it is not
                            necessarily bad that our votes differ so far as world opinion is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that it must be more than consultation. We must
                            coordinate our policies and our votes. In the future this should be
                            easier given the direction <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            has taken. Admittedly, he said, the press has played up too much our
                            differences. But on the whole the differences have been bad for public
                            opinion. He believed that the US delegation should be instructed to work
                            more closely with the <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0446"/>French,
                            British and Belgians and work towards a common line. So far as <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is concerned we cannot
                            compromise with his pretensions. There must be a showdown.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that our objectives have been communicated to
                            our delegation which has been asked to talk to the French and other
                            interested members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. He had just
                            talked with the Belgian Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d177fn1"
                                >Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> had
                                asked that U.S. influence be used to forestall any changes in the
                                Security Council resolutions under which <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                    >Hammarskjöld</persName> had been operating in the Congo. He and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had agreed that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s demands were
                                ridiculous and that it was necessary to support <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HD3">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s rejection of them.

                            to give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> our
                            views. We consider this a very important moment. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot fail in the Congo. There would be
                            great danger for the whole world if this happened. We must support the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Secretary-General. We
                            agree completely with his position on entry into the Katanga and with
                            his view that there can be no racial distinctions in the force. In view
                            of the exchange of letters between <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and the Secretary-General we believe that the
                            latter is on trial. We have to find out what he wants to do and what
                            sort of resolution he wishes. We have not yet seen him. We have sent no
                            definite instructions to our delegation pending this discussion with the
                            Ambassador. While we agree that basic principles cannot be compromised,
                            there are many ways to bring the debate to a close. We want to carry the
                            Africans along with us. Of course we do not know what the Soviets will
                            do.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Berard had seen Hammarskjold. The latter was
                            sure of himself. He said that this is a showdown and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot yield. Afro-Asians do not like
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as they believe that
                            his attitude could affect adversely their interests. On the other hand,
                            the Soviets do not like Hammarskjold. The latter believes that the West
                            should not put up a resolution but let the Soviets do so if they want
                            to. The rest can vote against or abstain.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that this line sounded good.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wallner said that he understood that Hammarskjold might say that he
                            believes that he has carried out the Security Council’s instructions
                            correctly and rest on that.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said this could lead to no resolution at all. The
                            Ambassador reverted to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> votes. He said
                            that the fact that we differ in our votes could lead people to question
                            the value of the Atlantic alliance. This possibility should be borne in
                            mind at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said he wanted to discuss another point relating to
                            the Congo. This was the Acting Secretary’s statement to the Congress in
                            which he said that the US would extend aid through the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and believed that other countries,
                            including France, would do the <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0447"

                                September 5, 1960, pp. 367–372.</note> The French Government has
                            informed the US through the Embassy in Paris that France does not
                            believe that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be the
                            exclusive channel. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot find all
                            the experts needed to run the Congo. Some day the Belgians will have to
                            return. This should be arranged bilaterally.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said he was addressing himself primarily to US aid.
                            We agree that the Congo cannot be settled satisfactorily without a
                            return of Belgian technicians. There may have to be special arrangements
                            for this. What we do not want to see is a whole series of bilateral
                            programs with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> trading one
                            country off against another. This makes it too easy for the Soviets and
                            Chinese Communists. It may be that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            program cannot prevent bilateral offers by the Soviets but it puts them
                            in a more difficult propaganda position. We also think that our
                            assistance may not be limited to technical help alone. The Congo needs
                            money to run itself. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could tailor
                            requests and prevent a series of approaches to different countries for
                            budgetary support. We understand the French position and hope that
                            France understands ours. We are not really apart on objectives.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said France favors: return of Belgian technicians, no
                            Katanga secession, and confederation. He then mentioned Nasser’s
                            launching of an idea of the creation of an African army ready to fight
                            anywhere.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said this idea originally came from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and been supported by Nasser. He
                            doubted that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would look
                            favorably on Nasser’s idea of taking over such an army.</p>

                            Kasa-Vubu will continue to be a political zero so long as <persName

                            naive, not very bright, lazy, enjoying his new found plush living and
                            content to appear occasionally in his new general’s uniform.</p>
                        <p>Joseph Ileo seems most likely successor if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> Government unseated by legal means. He is
                            President Senate where greatest chance lies to obtain vote no confidence
                            in <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Although we have been
                            in frequent contact with Ileo and he believes he has necessary
                            two-thirds vote, we are not persuaded they will be delivered when the
                            Senators have to stand up and be counted. In fact I am fairly certain
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> will prevent any such
                            Senate action and would have time to do so since motion of no confidence
                            has to be before Senate for 48 hours before vote can be taken. If he
                            unable buy and control enough votes to defeat motion he quite capable of
                            stationing <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> troops at Senate chamber to
                            prevent session. This he would probably justify under state of martial
                            law which he unilaterally declared last night at press conference and
                            defend as necessary to save Congo Government from Belgian plot take over
                            through subversion some members of Senate. In light of foregoing, I have
                            suggested to some of Ileo’s supporters that they must be prepared for
                            such countermeasures, adding that they might consider going into first
                            session (if allowed) with enough sandwiches to last full course of 48
                            hours. That should at least force <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                            another moderate who might well come to fore in successor government. He
                            has displayed courage on number of occasions and has more than once been
                            on verge of being ousted by <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Both Bolikango and Kalonji have considerable regional backing and would
                            probably be moderates in a government favoring loose confederation.
                            Yumbu, Vice Premier of Leopoldville province, is another moderate who
                            opposes <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>These are all, I believe, reasonable men who would work for constructive
                            solutions to the problems of the Congo. They are woefully untutored in
                            parliamentary tactics, only feel really secure in the familiar warmth of
                            their own regions and show no hopeful signs of being able to organize a
                            successful fire brigade. I would not, accordingly, be surprised if an
                            attempt is made on <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s life.
                            These people have more experience in the latter field than in the other.
                            While <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s elimination would
                            remove one problem, it might well create many more. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> would presumably succeed him and
                            is under same influence of Communist advisors. More color would be given
                            to the Belgian plot thesis and more reason for martial law. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would also be accused at least of
                            negligence, if not of complicity.</p>
                        <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>I could not more heartily agree we must not allow ourselves to get into
                            the apparent position of being out of sympathy with most of the African
                            states and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> at the same
                            time. The Soviets, of course, feel very comfortable in this regard. It
                            seems clear that Guinea is going straight down the Communist line and
                            will continue that way. Ghana is at least giving aid and comfort to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and the Communists but
                            for reasons peculiar to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>,
                            as I see it. We should therefore count on the strong possibility that
                            these two would oppose any change in the <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and any action of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            which would reduce <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s power
                            or change his political course.</p>
                        <p>We should, in my opinion, now make a quick and strong effort to convince
                            the rest of the African states of the real state of affairs in the Congo
                            and what defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and/or its
                            withdrawal would mean. I would hope that most if not all of the rest
                            could be persuaded support a strong <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            policy re which see my next following telegram.<note n="3"

                        <p>Re point 5. We have been trying educate and encourage selected
                            individuals and hope some progress being made. We feel whip hand is
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s and unless he is
                            stopped he will very shortly neutralize or eliminate the opposition near
                            him. He will have a much harder job in extending his influence to other
                            parts of country, excepting perhaps Luluabourg and Stanleyville where
                            his position is strong. Our best bet is to keep as many African states
                            on our side as possible. The West in general should support a stronger

                        <p>433. I have become increasingly unhappy over failure of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> so far to adopt a strong enough policy to
                            ensure real control over public order. At the outset, it was the
                            leaderless <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> which was the sole
                            disturber of order and there was no pattern of directed effort. I said
                            repeatedly after <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> decided to come in
                            that it should in the shortest possible time reduce the <gloss
                                target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> elements to discipline or disarm them,
                                <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0450"/>retrain those elements who
                            wash clean after investigation and insist the bad hats be punished. I
                            also said an officer corps of Congolese should be trained as soon as
                            possible. This was based on assumption that GOC genuinely wished to
                            restore order and would loyally support <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> effort.</p>
                        <p>Today there are still thousands of <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> with
                            their arms in remote parts of the country as well as in many of the
                            principal cities over which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has
                            not asserted authoritative control. It is true in Leopoldville the
                            potential for real trouble is, however, much worse since <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has greatly increased his
                            personal authority over the local <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> and
                            they have, in the last few days, again made arbitrary detentions,
                            including <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel, civilian and
                            military, and broken into hotels and apartments. They now show
                            unmistakable signs of being directed. Their actions follow <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s frequent public statements and
                            the line he takes in them; i.e., he claimed yesterday there were Belgian
                            paratroops in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> uniforms and wearing
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> armbands and the detentions of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel followed
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>This force has already shown its lack responsibility and under <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s direction could be incited to
                            action against <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops and even whites
                            in general. He has already shown direction of next step which is attempt
                            secure withdrawal Swedes. If that successful, expect Irish and Canadians
                            will be next on the list. He would probably be happy if all but a few
                            Guineans and Ghanaians (without white officers) were withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>I can assure Department that if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does
                            not immediately act to take <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> out of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> control and if <gloss
                                target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> continues to get away with current
                            conduct, most of the handful of Europeans still in Leopoldville will
                            leave and the remainder would be some foreign Embassy personnel,
                            Communist agents and carpetbaggers.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that foregoing is the Communist plan. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, Kashamura, Ghanaian Ambassador
                            Djin and Madame Blouin are all anti-white and latter Communist. So are

                            instincts direct him at least part way. The objective seems clear:
                            Remove the bulk of Europeans and you eliminate effective western
                            influence. Once Europeans have gone, nationalize their property on
                            simple theory that business and industry must run to keep Congolese
                            employed and if Europeans will not run them Congolese Government must.
                            Finally <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> would invite Commie bloc
                            experts in to keep business and industry going.</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0451"/>
                        <p>It seems to me clear <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is
                            playing this game wittingly or unwittingly. I would hate to stand here
                            and watch this gambit played out under the noses of an impotent <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military force. In fact many of latter
                            are already furious at indignities they have suffered and at <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for keeping them under such wraps that
                            they cannot be effective.</p>
                        <p>I quite understand the difficulties facing the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in applying
                            effective military control. I suppose the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> would at this stage veto any resolution with teeth in

                            there. However I feel the risk must be taken and the sooner the better.
                            This situation is rapidly getting worse and the Commie design now seems
                            suddenly clear. It is already late.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">Telegram

                                as an order for the assassination of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                                his impression at the time but that, in retrospect, he was uncertain
                                whether it was an accurate reading of the President’s meaning; both

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> called on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to introduce the
                            discussion. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                            that the disagreement between <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and Hammarskjold could create a grave situation.
                            The Security Council meeting had been delayed to permit the Congolese
                            delegation to get to New York. The delegation would be headed by Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> who is as bad or
                            worse than <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. The U.S. had
                            suggested a further delay in the Security Council meeting and
                            Hammarskjold had agreed. All the Africans in New York are opposed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and we wanted the
                            Congolese delegation to have time to learn this. It might calm them down
                            somewhat.</p>
                        <p>We believe, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            indicated, that the Soviet Union is behind the Congolese move. <hi
                                rend="italic">Pravda</hi> had made a strong attack on the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the Soviet representative had told
                            Hammarskjold on Wednesday that he disagreed with Hammarskjold’s
                            interpretation and agreed with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s interpretation of the Security Council
                            resolutions. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s letters to Hammarskjold had not been written
                            by <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. The interchange took
                            place too rapidly and there was too much evidence of knowledge of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedures for this to have been
                            possible. Hammarskjold believes that they were written by a Belgian
                            Communist who is <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s chief
                            of cabinet. Others, however, think that a Soviet attaché in the Congo,
                            who has had extensive <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> experience, may
                            have been the author.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">Reference is
                                presumably to Soviet Chargé Andrei A. Fomin.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was Hammarskjold’s idea, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> continued, to present his interpretation of the
                            Security Council’s resolutions and to say that he would follow out this
                            interpretation unless he was otherwise requested by the Security
                            Council. This would put the ball in the Soviets’ court. If the Soviets
                            moved a resolution against Hammarskjold, we would speak in support of
                            him. The Soviets would then get two votes for their resolution and nine
                            abstentions. This would mean that the original resolution and
                            Hammarskjold’s interpretation of it would stand. Nothing positive saying
                            that Hammarskjold was right would be offered because such a resolution
                            could be vetoed by the Soviet Union. This seemed to be an intelligent
                            way to handle the matter and Hammarskjold was confident of success.
                            Hammarskjold considers <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> an
                            impossible person and has suggested that an explanation of his up and
                            down behavior may be that he takes dope. Hammarskjold is worried about
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>, who continues, in
                            Hammarskjold’s view, to have ambitions for leading a large African
                            state. Hammarskjold believes that he may be working with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in the hope of taking him
                            over.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0453"/>
                        <p>There was no immediate danger to Hammarskjold’s position in the current
                            situation but there was real danger if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> carried out his threats. If the Security Council
                            backed Hammarskjold and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            carried out his threat to force the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            out, he might then offer to accept help from anyone. It was
                            Hammarskjold’s view that it would be difficult for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to remain in the Congo if the Congolese
                            Government actively opposed it. Also, the countries that have
                            contributed troops to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force would
                            probably not want their troops to remain if the Congo actively opposed
                            their presence. The elimination of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            would be a disaster which, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> stated, we should do everything we could to
                            prevent. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were forced out, we
                            might be faced by a situation where the Soviets intervened by invitation
                            of the Congo after the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been forced
                            out. This would be a different situation from the one foreseen earlier
                            and would be a very difficult one.</p>
                        <p>It was Mr. Hammarskjold’s view, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> indicated, that the only way that the Congo can
                            be kept going is for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to run it as
                            a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship, although it would not
                            be called that. The only reason that Katanga continues to operate is
                            that Belgian civilians there are still running the government and
                            business. U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1"
                                >Timberlake</persName> is concerned that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> has not been forceful enough in dealing with the Force
                            Publique. The Force Publique is armed and <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> could use it to terrorize the whites. He might
                            force all the whites out except for the Soviet technicians. Summing up,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated that how
                            to deal with the problem in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council was fairly clear but what came after the Security
                            Council debate was not so clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said that it was the
                            consensus of people who know the Congo that it was the objective of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to drive the whites
                            out and to take over their property; that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had no concept of the implications of such
                            action for his country. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said that he was working to serve the purposes of
                            the Soviets and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was in Soviet pay. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> asked whether the
                            situation in the Congo did not call for quiet recognition of Tshombe’s
                            efforts to pick up other areas of the Congo. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that this might be
                            appropriate. He pointed out that if the Congo was to be a viable state,
                            it would need the resources of Katanga. He said that there was a lot of
                            interest in the idea of a loose confederation of the sort favored by
                            Tshombe. We could not support Tshombe while Belgian troops were in
                            Katanga because then Tshombe had been simply a Belgian puppet. But now
                            that the Belgians were largely out and were beginning the evacuation of
                            their bases, something may be possible.</p>
                        <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0454"/>
                        <p>The President said that the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> would be forced out was simply inconceivable. We should
                            keep the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the Congo even if we had
                            to ask for European troops to do it. We should do so even if such action
                            was used by the Soviets as the basis for starting a fight. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> indicated that this was State’s
                            feeling but that the Secretary General and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> doubted whether, if the Congo
                            put up really determined opposition to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could stay in. In
                            response, the President stated that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> was wrong to this extent—we were talking of one
                            man forcing us out of the Congo; of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> supported by the Soviets. There was no
                            indication, the President stated, that the Congolese did not want <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support and the maintenance of order.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reiterated that
                            this was State’s feeling about the matter. The situation that would be
                            created by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> withdrawal was altogether
                            too ghastly to contemplate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> suggested that if the assets of Katanga
                            could be retained, the economy of the Congo could be throttled. The
                            Soviets would have to throw a lot of money into the rest of the Congo to
                            keep it viable in such a case. It was important to preserve Katanga as a
                            separate viable asset. The President suggested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might recognize Katanga. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> suggested that we might base
                            ourselves on Tshombe and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it essential that the airfield at
                            Kitona, and the port of Banana, and the Kamina base complex, Republic of
                            Congo, remain in friendly hands, and further, that these facilities be
                            denied to the military forces of the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s repudiation of the
                            unratified Treaty of friendship, assistance and technical cooperation
                            between the Republic of Congo and Belgium exposes Congolese bases to
                            occupancy by outside forces. The collapse of the Belgian military
                            position and withdrawal of Belgian technicians create the need for
                            foreign technical assistance to operate the base facilities. Even with
                            the bases under their national control, the possibility exists that the
                            Congolese would request Soviet assistance or request assistance from
                            Communists of the Western World.</p>
                        <p>3. The continued availability of the Kitona–Banana complex to the Free
                            World is strategically important as a base for maritime patrol aircraft
                            in support of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> in the South Atlantic,
                            for the control of ocean shipping, and as a major point of access to the
                            Congo and Africa south of the Sahara. The flow of shipping around South
                            Africa would be increased significantly should the use of the Suez Canal
                            be denied to the West. Protection of this shipping is a major task for
                            Allied Forces and vital to any war effort. The dearth of suitable
                            harbors on the West African coast further increases the importance of
                            these port facilities.</p>
                        <p>4. The covert activities of just a few Communists infiltrating such
                            essential facilities in Banana as river piloting, river dredging,
                            stevedoring or harbor control could result in the denial of these
                            facilities to the West and Soviet domination of the economic lifeline to
                            the Congo and Central Africa. A similar encroachment into the
                            communications or control functions of the Kitona airfield could provide
                            the Soviets with <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0456"/>a readily
                            available airfield to facilitate rapid military expansion into West
                            Africa. Only a few Communist civilian technicians would be required to
                            develop a ship repair facility in Banana, which could suddenly become a
                            base capable of supporting Soviet-Bloc submarines. These strategically
                            significant military gains would then have been accomplished with
                            minimum and imperceptible Soviet action.</p>
                        <p>5. With Soviet occupancy or control of the facilities in the
                            Kitona–Banana complex, either overt or covert, their military forces
                            could then threaten the Free World’s essential South Atlantic sea
                            routes. In order to offset this capability it would be necessary to
                            redeploy our already over-committed naval forces or establish a
                            requirement for increased force levels to meet this new threat.</p>
                        <p>6. The Kamina base complex is strategically located in the heart of
                            sub-Saharan Africa, where the potential for a breakdown in law and order
                            in both established and emerging nations is high. Since future
                            developments in sub-Saharan Africa will probably require the stabilizing
                            presence of U.S., Western or U.N. military forces, the availability to
                            the Free World or the U.N. of the Kamina base, as a staging area for
                            military operations in times of crises, would be of significant
                            advantage. In addition, the importance of maintaining overflight
                            privileges in sub-Saharan Africa for the movement of Western combat
                            forces to potential trouble spots in the Middle East and Asia is
                            increasing in view of the present negative attitude of many of the
                            nations in the Middle East and North Africa on overflight privileges by
                            Western combat forces. Viewed in this light, Western overflight
                            privileges in the Congo and the Kamina base air facilities take on
                            increasing importance. Of even greater significance, however, is the
                            importance of denying the Kamina base to the Soviet Bloc. In peacetime,
                            Soviet Bloc control of Kamina would provide a focal point for Communist
                            subversive operations and a ready source of military assistance in
                            support of indirect aggressions to facilitate Communist coups in
                            neighboring African nations, many of which are extremely susceptible. In
                            wartime, Soviet Bloc control of the Kamina base would seriously
                            jeopardize Free World air and sea communications in this area of the
                            world and would require the employment of military forces to eliminate
                            this Soviet Bloc base.</p>
                        <p>7. In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff request that you
                            reaffirm to the Secretary of State the Defense Department’s concern that
                            the Kitona–Banana and Kamina bases remain under friendly control and
                            that all possible steps be taken to deny these facilities to the Soviet
                            Bloc. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, therefore, recommend that action be
                            initiated to accomplish the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Ensure that the U.N. assumes timely control of the area to preclude
                            unilateral control by unfriendly forces;</p>
                        <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0457"/>
                        <p>b. That the U.S. and/or other friendly governments initiate military
                            assistance programs to provide for the continuing adequate maintenance
                            and operation of these facilities;</p>
                        <p>c. A program be initiated to provide Congolese personnel with Western
                            training in base operations and maintenance;</p>
                        <p>d. That covert action, including the introduction of agents, be taken in
                            all of the above to ensure pro-Western orientation.<note n="1"

                            accept laissez-passer or accept our explanation who we were and our
                            business. He would not permit us enter grounds. After considerable
                            argument we persuaded him take us inside where office staff spent
                            confused ten minutes debating what should be done after which I was
                            escorted across street and left standing on curb for 15 minutes. Having
                            thus consumed half an hour, I returned to Embassy. Within minutes I had
                            had two calls from his Chef de Cabinet, Grootaert, offering apologies
                            and saying Prime Minister would see me immediately if I could
                            return.</p>
                        <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0458"/>
                        <p>I did so at 11:00 and was ushered in, with Lavallee, to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Grootaert was the only other
                            person present. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> offered
                            profuse apologies and explained that guards and staff were unfamiliar
                            with simple problems such as visits of this nature. If I had set stage
                            myself, I could not have contrived a better environment for tackling the
                            Prime Minister on a number of problems which I might not have raised had
                            visit gone off smoothly on the first round.</p>
                        <p>I told him I understood the earlier contretemps and then suggested he
                            make certain in the future his staff took care of arrangements at the
                            gate and in the waiting room so that visitors with appointments to see
                            the Prime Minister would not be arbitrarily stopped and prevented from
                            entering. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> agreed that this
                            must be done.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that six members our plane-handling crew at airport had
                            been stopped and surrounded by members Force Publique yesterday at
                            airfield and their identification papers taken away from them
                            temporarily. They were released and permitted to proceed only after
                            members Ghanaian forces had interceded on their behalf. I pointed out
                            how unnecessary and how bad, point of view public relations, such action
                            was.</p>
                        <p>2. <note n="1" xml:id="d182fn1">There is no numbered paragraph 1.</note>
                            I stated members of foreign press had been molested by Force Publique
                            yesterday when gathered in front his office for press conference he had
                            called. I told <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> I had never
                            known US and Free World press to have carried story such as the one on
                            the Congo so sympathetically, so fully and so much on their front pages.
                            I said this was of primary importance to the Congo and to efforts being
                            made to meet the needs of his government and his people. I told him that
                            he should assist the press in all possible ways. He replied by giving
                            instructions over the telephone to one of his assistants to see that
                            this was done.</p>
                        <p>At that point one of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            aides brought in the passport and other identifying documents of <hi
                                rend="italic">Los Angeles Times</hi> correspondent Drake, who had
                            apparently been detained. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            asked me whether he was bona fide and whether he should be permitted to
                            stay in Congo despite fact Drake had arrived without a visa. I said I
                            know him personally and could vouch for him adding that he should be
                            permitted to remain. The aide was dispatched with the documents and I am
                            sure they were returned to Drake at once.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out he or his services could always check bona fides of any
                            American newsman or businessman with Embassy. Without naming Detwiler, I
                            made broad reference to persons who were interested only in making money
                            fast and by any means, legal or otherwise. I stated such persons were
                            bad for Prime Minister, the Congo and if Americans, for US. I said we
                            are at his disposal to provide him and his <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429"
                                facs="0459"/>government with information regarding Americans who
                            might wish to do business with Congo. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> stated a Van Der Meersch had telephoned 3 times
                            from New York regarding a business proposition but in view of his
                            “Detwiler” experience had refused to talk to him. He was under
                            impression this Van Der Meersch had formerly worked with Dillon Read. I
                            told him I would query Department re any information it could give
                            regarding Van Der Meersch and his present connections. Please
                            advise.</p>
                        <p>I then gave Prime Minister letter from Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy,
                                Stratton<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">An engineering consulting
                                firm.</note> and stated this was a well-known, respectable and solid
                            business firm. I also handed him a letter from Coolidge<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d182fn3">Zoologist Harold Jefferson Coolidge.</note>
                            regarding the Preservation of Wildlife in the Congo National Parks. Both
                            were sent through me since I had talked with Bryant of Tippetts et al.
                            and Coolidge during last visit Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister declared everyone could see he was not Communist since
                            he had first called upon an American businessman to help exploit riches
                            of country. He had also asked his various ministers to furnish him with
                            names candidates who could proceed to US on some of 300 scholarships,
                            which we had offered Congo. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> pointed out he wished first students go to US
                            and not Moscow or Prague. Also in this connection, Prime Minister stated
                            he had decided yesterday to send Joseph Mbuyi to Washington as
                            Ambassador. Therefore first <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            Ambassador to be sent anywhere in world would go to US. He declared that
                            in few days Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> would come to Embassy with new
                            Ambassador-designate in order obtain assistance on housing and
                            information on clerical situation in US. I told him we would be very
                            glad offer all assistance possible.</p>
                        <p>4. I stated there were many persons who were trying to operate in this
                            new country and that Prime Minister should be extremely careful
                            regarding the choice of his advisers and to consider carefully their
                            counsel since some might be taking the Congo down the wrong road. Prime
                            Minister declared that the one overriding thought of his government was
                            to rid the country of Belgian troops. He said he and his colleagues were
                            not anti-Belgian. In fact, they wanted Belgian technicians and experts
                            to stay on in order help this new country. I informed Prime Minister I
                            had pointed that fact out to our President and to National Security
                            Council as well as in Department.</p>
                        <p>5. Prime Minister declared he appreciated all <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> had done here, but severely criticized Hammarskjold for
                            not having complied with resolutions of Security Council, for not having
                            consulted his government prior to his visit to Elisabethville where he
                            “negotiated” with Tshombe. He also expressed anger at <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> for having refused wait for <pb n="430"
                                xml:id="pg_430" facs="0460"/>Congolese Delegation which was
                            proceeding to New York and Prime Minister declared that no doubt
                            Hammarskjold wished to talk first to Afro-Asian group and to Security
                            Council before arrival Congolese representatives.</p>
                        <p>After my talk with Prime Minister I accompanied Grootaert who had been
                            present and who is one of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>’s Chefs de Cabinet, although a Belgian, to his
                            office. Grootaert, formerly judge in Katanga and who apparently has been
                            advising <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> regarding
                            interpretation Security Council resolutions, made following points:</p>
                        <p>1. There is apparently honest difference of opinion between <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            re interpretation Security Council resolutions. <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> which bases itself on Roman law interprets letter of
                            law while <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, basing himself on common
                            law, is guided by precedents such as Lebanese and Korean cases.</p>
                        <p>2. To understand <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> one must
                            realize he was “raised” in Belgian-type liberal circles.</p>
                        <p>3. Reverting to my remarks to Prime Minister that he should be careful re
                            choice of advisers, Grootaert stated he was very much disturbed by type
                            of Communist advisers who now surround <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. He referred particularly to the Guineans and to
                            the Press Attaché, Serge Michel, who according to him was placed at
                            disposal <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> by <gloss
                                target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> and Ferhat Abbas<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d182fn4">Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional
                                Government.</note> while Prime Minister was in Tunis. Grootaert did
                            not believe Prime Minister had fully understood import of my remarks and
                            my caveat concerning his advisers. Grootaert said he would spell out my
                            meaning to <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. I asked him
                            what he thought of a proposal we had in mind to invite Kashamura to
                            visit US. He thought it was excellent, since the Information Minister
                            could very well profit from a first-hand contact with US.</p>
                        <p>4. Grootaert did not understand why <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            troops had refused prevent killings between warring Luluas and Balubas
                            in Luluabourg area. He said it was one of functions of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces to restore law and order in
                            country.</p>
                        <p>5. Chef de Cabinet stated it was desire of Prime Minister to have
                            Moroccan General Kettani together with assistance Ghanaian troops train
                            National Army. In his opinion, army must be thoroughly reformed,
                            regrouped, and members be given new-type uniforms. There must be
                            complete break between new army and old Force Publique. Although on
                            number of occasions, Prime Minister and Grootaert had asked talk with
                            Kettani, <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> thus far had not
                            sent Moroccan General to them. I said I would talk to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. Grootaert stated that few days ago 40 Belgian soldiers had been found
                            in Leopoldville and that radio equipment had been seized in building
                            formerly occupied by Belgian Embassy.</p>

                        <p>I was with Prime Minister for one and one quarter hours and with
                            Grootaert for nearly an hour.</p>

                        <p>The U.N. Security Council discussed the situation in the Congo at its
                            887th through 889th meetings, August 21–22. A telegram dated August 20
                            from Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to the
                            President of the Security Council had, inter alia, requested that the
                            Council recommend to the Secretary-General that he should “make contact
                            and conduct negotiations exclusively” with the Congo Government, urged
                            “that all United Nations action in the Congo should take place in
                            exclusive, continuous and permanent collaboration with the Government
                            and that the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in the Congo
                            should regularly report to it on the activities of United Nations
                            troops,” and urged the immediate and total withdrawal of all Belgian
                            troops from the Congo. (U.N. doc. S/4448; printed in part in <hi

                            U.N. operations in the Congo in an opening statement on August 21, which
                            he enlarged upon in subsequent statements. He declared that he was not
                            requesting “a confirmation by the Security Council of the obvious” but
                            that his aim in asking the Council to convene had been solely to clarify
                            the Council’s attitude. (U.N. doc. S/PV.887) In the discussion, the

                            supported the Secretary-General, and the Council adjourned on August 22
                            without passing any resolutions. A Soviet draft resolution to establish

                                    Africa, Department of State, with attached comments, stating
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had resisted
                                    efforts by other agencies to amend the document and make it a

                                    amendments included the replacement of the first sentence of
                                    paragraph 6 by the following:</p>
                                <p>“Although there have been reports of plots to assassinate
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, it is
                                    improbable he will be killed. The practice of political
                                    assassination, which exists north of the Sahara, has not yet
                                    developed to the south, and no major African leader has yet been
                                    killed by fellow Africans. It is much more probable that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> will not be
                                    removed by force, and that the internal Congolese political
                                    struggle will continue unresolved for some time.”</p>
                                <p>The following was proposed as a replacement for the first
                                    sentence of paragraph 13a:</p>
                                <p>“The adoption of some form of federal government, as proposed by

                                    would strengthen the provinces. This would probably be coupled

                        <p>1. The breakdown of civil order in the Congo and the confused period of
                            struggle, invective, and improvisation which has followed have deeply
                            affected a wide range of elements and interests outside <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0466"/>the Congo itself. The crisis has raised
                            serious problems and emotions not only with Belgium, whose citizens,
                            pride, and property have been directly threatened, but with other
                            European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, and has raised
                            once again divisive questions about the direction and unity of Western
                            policy in dealing with rampant anti-colonialist nationalism. The Bloc
                            has been presented with substantial opportunities for fomenting trouble
                            and extending its opportunities at the expense of the West.</p>
                        <p>2. Among other Afro-Asian states, particularly those of West Africa, the
                            crisis has revived anti-colonialist emotions, aroused fears regarding
                            their own unity and freedom from cold war tensions, and created hopes of
                            extending their own influence. Meanwhile it has added to tensions in
                            nearby areas still under white rule. For the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and particularly Secretary-General Hammarskjold, the
                            crisis has brought unprecedented responsibilities, involving risks of
                            damaging <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cohesiveness and prestige as
                            well as the possibility of enhancing the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>’s overall role in world affairs. Behind the conflict of
                            external interests in the Congo, finally, lurks the possibility of a
                            major East-West confrontation.</p>
                        <p>3. The situation is still too fluid to permit a useful estimate of the
                            future course of events; indeed it is difficult to describe such a
                            swiftly moving state of affairs. Three main elements, each of them
                            complex enough by itself, exist and interact. First are the internal
                            political struggles in the Congo, between <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and his domestic foes, between the ideas of
                            centralism and federalism, between Elisabethville and Leopoldville,
                            between order and chaos. Second is the pressure of various external
                            interests on the situation—the interests of Belgium, of the Western
                            world generally, of the Bloc, and of the other African states. Finally
                            there is the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> itself, desperately
                            trying to reconcile these various pressures and interests, and in the
                            process becoming itself a factor of power of the first importance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Immediate Future</p>
                        <p>4. Should there be sufficiently broad international support for a
                            continuing active <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in the Congo,
                            the intensity of the internal Congolese political struggle and its
                            repercussions elsewhere would soon be reduced, at least to some degree.
                            On the other hand, should the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> be
                            forced to withdraw, or should there be a serious split in the
                            non-Communist world about the desirability of its remaining, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s efforts to establish and
                            consolidate his power would be <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0467"
                            />more unrestrained, and the other interests involved—notably Belgium,
                            the Bloc, and such African states as Ghana and Guinea—would probably be
                            forced to choose between accepting increasing involvement or backing
                            down as best they could.</p>
                        <p>5. One possibility is that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            might be assassinated, or that his external support might fall away and
                            effective internal opposition to his policies crystallize. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on the one hand and the leaders of
                            Guinea and to a lesser extent Ghana on the other appear to be developing
                            a considerable stake in <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> regard him as useful in
                            cleaning out the Belgians and see him as a potential client. Guinea and
                            Ghana oppose any beginnings of regional separatism and hope that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> can be tied to their
                            Pan-Africanist leading strings. However, even they may develop
                            misgivings about overcommitting themselves to a man of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s volatility and unreliability,
                            especially in the face of the growing reservations of many other African
                            and Asian states about him.</p>
                        <p>6. Assuming that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> continues
                            in office, however—and this still appears likely—the internal Congolese
                            political struggle will probably continue unresolved for some time. Even
                            though <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces remain in the country,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> will probably retain
                            the initiative, since he has the only Congolese military forces outside
                            the Katanga and is evidently willing to move ruthlessly to beat down and
                            intimidate those opposing or restraining him, including as necessary the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. These factors, together with the
                            apparent absence of any other Congolese leader with comparable energy,
                            prominence, and willingness to do battle at the national level, give him
                            substantial advantages.</p>
                        <p>7. Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that he will swiftly be able to
                            establish and consolidate anything more than a skeletonized government,
                            holding power of a sort at the center but with its control over the rest
                            of the country at least initially tenuous. The Congolese army lacks
                            trained officers and equipment and has still to establish its
                            unquestioned loyalty to him. His political organization is strong only
                            in comparison to those of other, more locally based leaders. If some
                            modus vivendi is worked out with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            help will be available from that quarter in averting a total breakdown
                            of basic governmental and economic functions, but probably only at the
                            expense of placing restraints on the pace of his consolidation of power.
                            On the other hand, forcing out the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            while probably increasing <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>’s freedom of action, would place new burdens on his
                            own overworked security forces and threaten the loss of Western and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> technical and financial support.
                            Under these circumstances, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            would probably supply economic and technical help promptly (perhaps
                            including military instructors) and some troops would probably be
                            forthcoming from <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0468"/>Guinea and
                            perhaps one or two other countries. But even if these moves were not
                            countered by the West, the actual consolidation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s power would take time.</p>
                        <p>8. At least until the basic political problem is resolved, the danger of
                            new riots and clashes will remain. Another wholesale breakdown of
                            authority is possible, and would indeed be almost certain if <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops are withdrawn. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> seems intent on continuing his
                            harassment of whites, possibly involving clashes between Congolese and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces. With the economy and
                            administration in disarray and both <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and his opponents likely to play on tribal
                            rivalries in their efforts to gain support, new inter-tribal battles
                            could readily develop.</p>
                        <p>9. The explosive Katanga issue also remains. It is possible that the
                            issue will eventually be resolved without open hostilities. As part of a
                            successful drive to consolidate his position, <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> may in time succeed through international
                            pressure, subversion, or perhaps assassination in isolating and toppling
                            the Katanga government. Alternatively, the central government (though
                            probably not under <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>) may
                            become willing to reach a compromise. For the present, however, there is
                            growing danger of an armed clash. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> appears intent on building up his forces for
                            this purpose, while Tshombe, thanks in part to some remaining Belgian
                            advisors, has a fairly substantial defense force. Unless convinced that
                            armed resistance would be futile or internationally disastrous, Belgium
                            and other European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members would
                            probably back Katanga and place strong pressure on the US to do
                            likewise. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, in turn, would
                            probably have some military support from at least Guinea among the
                            African powers, and diplomatic and moral support (and perhaps arms) from
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Although we consider it
                            unlikely that either the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                            Belgium and its friends would actually send troops to the scene, the
                            result could be a major East-West confrontation in which the emotions of
                            many Afro-Asian states would be deeply involved and the capacity of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to mediate might have been
                            seriously prejudiced.</p>
                        <p>10. Katanga is not the only province where separatist sentiment exists.
                            Some steps toward autonomy have been taken by local political leaders in
                            three other provinces as well, and the “independent” Mining State of
                            Kasai has already been proclaimed. Such developments will further
                            complicate the confusion.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Further Prospects</p>
                        <p>11. As we see it at present, four possible outcomes of the present
                            political struggle warrant attention: (a) the establishment of central
                            authority under <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>; (b) the
                            establishment of a federal type of government, most probably <hi

                                >Lumumba</persName>; (c) a fragmented Congo; and (d) <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control. As indicated above, we cannot
                            confidently predict at this early stage precisely what one solution as
                            against the <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0469"/>other would mean
                            for the Congo and the various interested outside parties. However, the
                            following projections would appear to be reasonable.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Central Authority under <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                    >Lumumba</persName>
                            </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The establishment of effective central authority, for which <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> alone appears to have the drive
                            and ability, would certainly involve the extensive use of authoritarian
                            measures, supplemented by efforts to broaden the geographical and
                            popular base of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            political movement. Given the depth of the Congo’s tribal and regional
                            differences, the government’s control over the hinterland would rest on
                            its ability to discourage or repress serious resistance to its wishes
                            rather than on genuine acceptance of central authority. It would be
                            tenuous in many more remote areas.</p>
                        <p>b. Any Congolese government will require extensive technical and economic
                            assistance to keep its economy and administration going. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is probably quite capable of
                            turning again to Belgium, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and the
                            US once he has established that he is the man to deal with. The Belgians
                            in particular will be bitter, and reluctant to do further business with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. However, the Western
                            countries will generally be concerned to retain a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> tie with the Congo, rather than cut <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> totally adrift.</p>
                        <p>b. 1. In the absence of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> assistance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> will turn elsewhere,
                            possibly first to a group of Afro-Asian countries, which would almost
                            certainly be unable to fulfill the Congo’s needs. At the same time, he
                            will recognize that major assistance must come from the major powers,
                            and the Bloc is likely to be less inhibited than the West in taking over
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If Congolese dependence on
                            the Bloc became substantial, it would facilitate the expulsion or flight
                            of Western economic interests, pave the way for establishment of
                            Communist-type economic institutions, and generally facilitate a
                            politico-economic development similar to that in Guinea.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s foreign policy would
                            probably be opportunistic and quixotic. His probable dependence for
                            support and advice on the Bloc and on such African countries as Ghana
                            and Guinea, coupled with his underlying anti-Belgian, anti-white
                            feelings, would make him a left neutralist, but he would probably be
                            hard to keep pinned down. He would probably be a disruptive element
                            among other African and Asian states. He is an obvious target for
                            competitive efforts to exert influence over him and by his wild behavior
                            would probably irritate the older line neutralists and pro-Western
                            governments. Although his establishment of a dominant position would
                            discourage separatists in other African states and reinforce the fears
                            of white elements still dominant in other areas, his Congo state would
                            probably long remain too weak to exert significant pressures of its own
                            in such areas. However, under <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> the Congo might become a base for Bloc
                            operations in the area, e.g., the running of arms into Angola and
                            Northern Rhodesia.</p>

                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Federal Type of Government</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The abandonment of the present unitary state in favor of a federal
                            arrangement, with more power returned to the provinces, would probably
                            be coupled with the downfall of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, who is bitterly opposed to regionalism. This
                            may prove to be the only practical arrangement for the present in a
                            country as disunited as the Congo and lacking political leaders with
                            other than a local following. However, it would involve a revamping of
                            such elements of the Belgian administrative structure as remain in which
                            coordination of activities on a national basis would be more difficult
                            and efficiency lost.</p>
                        <p>b. The leading political figures in a federation would probably be
                            disposed to rely on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the West
                            for technical assistance and economic aid, at least at the outset. They
                            might even be willing to come to some agreement by which a substantial
                            number of the Belgian technicians might return. As time goes on,
                            however, these essentially opportunistic leaders would probably cast
                            around for assistance from any outside source including the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>c. The federal solution would be a bitter disappointment to some
                            influential African leaders who would see it as the opening wedge
                            leading to secessionist moves elsewhere. With a weak central government
                            the Congo would become a natural battle ground for a variety of
                            conflicting interests including Pan-Africanists, white settlers in the
                            Rhodesias and Kenya, and the Bloc. Because of its encouragement of
                            regional ambitions, a federal arrangement would also stimulate agitation
                            for new political groupings, linking tribal elements in Angola and the
                            former French Congo with their tribal brethren in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi rend="italic">A Fragmented Congo</hi>. A fragmented Congo—i.e., a
                            complete separation of Katanga from the rest of the Congo, or a further
                            division into separate and independent states—would almost certainly be
                            a source of weakness and contention in the area. It is strongly opposed
                            not only by the Africans but by most European powers, who fear the
                            impact of regional separatism elsewhere. Even the present Katanga
                            leadership is seeking autonomy, not independence. Thus the persistence
                            of an independent Katanga would represent the continuation of an
                            unresolved battle rather than any viable solution and would be a
                            continuing source of political if not military skirmishing.</p>
                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">

                            frequently arisen whether the Congo might not be best served by a

                            nominally independent Congo government through extensive use of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> administrators and advisers.</p>
                        <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>a. An attempt at such a solution might prove unavoidable in the event of
                            another drastic breakdown of civil authority within the Congolese
                            republic, and moves toward de facto <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            administrative control might take place under any moderate successor to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. If the Belgian link
                            is in fact broken beyond repair, this might prove the only way (other
                            than resort to the Bloc) of providing the thousands of administrators
                            needed to replace Belgians m the government.</p>
                        <p>b. Over and above the managerial problems of recruiting and organizing a
                            large-scale <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> administrative team,
                            however, the venture would involve difficult political problems and
                            would be hard to sustain for more than a brief period in which little
                            real preparation of Congolese leaders could take place. In time
                            virtually all Congolese leaders would become increasingly restive over
                            outside domination, even on an international basis, and in this they
                            would be supported by the other African states. The problem of financial
                            relations would be a serious one. Finally, the arrangement would be
                            conditioned on a long-sustained consensus in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, involving the Bloc and the Afro-Asian group, that such
                            a solution was the best for all concerned. This would be certainly
                            difficult to maintain. Even if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control
                            was not directly attacked, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would
                            have to cope with a wide range of attempted political manipulation and
                            proselytization within the Congo.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi rend="italic">General Comments</hi>. In addition to the
                            foregoing, certain general conclusions can probably be advanced on the
                            probable effects of the Congo crisis:</p>
                        <p>a. The Belgian future in the Congo is bleak. The Belgian
                            presence—administrators, economic enterprises, etc.—is eventually likely
                            to become minimal or nonexistent if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> continues in power. Although his replacement by
                            a more moderate leadership would probably open the way for a formulation
                            of new arrangements for continued Belgian-Congolese cooperation in
                            administrative, financial, and economic matters, too much fear and
                            bitterness has been aroused on both sides for such arrangements to
                            persist for very long.</p>
                        <p>b. Thus, the crisis will achieve one of the important Soviet objectives
                            in the area, to end the political and economic dominance of the Western
                            powers over what is in terms of resources one of the richest areas in
                            Africa. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will also have
                            substantial opportunities for developing its own influence and moulding
                            the state and economy along radical lines, particularly if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> remains in power. Given the
                            primitive level of political development in the Congo, however, we
                            consider it unlikely that the Congo would become an actual Communist
                            state at any early date. Moreover, the crisis might result in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> becoming heavily committed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s success but unable
                            or unwilling to provide the necessary support.</p>
                        <p>c. These prospects will almost certainly be a source of deep uneasiness
                            not only to Belgium but also to France, Portugal, and other European
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members. We are not prepared
                            to say that this would adversely affect <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> military posture. However, it will almost certainly
                            stimulate further European pressure—directed primarily at the US—for the
                            development of coordinated policies for meeting the joint challenge of
                            nationalism and communism in Africa and other underdeveloped areas.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>d. For the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the crisis provides
                            unprecedented opportunities and risks. It may emerge with a much
                            enlarged role in preserving peace and stability in the underdeveloped
                            world. If it succeeds, this would probably involve welcome indication
                            that on this issue at least, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            was willing to cooperate in limiting the risks of East-West competition.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organization may, on the other
                            hand, become overextended and discredited, with Hammarskjold perhaps
                            forced to resign. An additional danger is of critical cleavages within
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> between the Bloc and the
                            non-Communist world, or between the Afro-Asian group and the West.</p>

                        <p>At the 457th meeting of the National Security Council on August 25,
                            Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> discussed developments in the Congo during his
                            briefing on significant world developments. The relevant portion of the
                            memorandum of discussion by Deputy <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W.
                                Boggs</persName>, August 25, reads as follows: “Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had receded from his extremist position as a
                            result of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council meeting
                            on the Congo. It is possible that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is only beating a tactical retreat, however; he
                            may resume the offensive at any time. The next issue to arise in the
                            Congo may concern the Belgian insistence that a complete relinquishment
                            of the Belgian air bases must await negotiations. Belgium is planning a
                            “presence” in Katanga in the form of technicians even though Belgian
                            troops are scheduled to be withdrawn by August 30. Training a Congo
                            armed force will prove to be a difficult task in view of the
                            disintegration of the Force Publique which has already taken place. It
                            is unlikely that a large force of trained Congo troops can be assembled
                            in the near future. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> displayed a map of
                            the Congo and pointed out the Kasai province to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was attempting to airlift troops
                            in order to prevent another attempted secession. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> explained that the southern part of
                            Kasai was threatening to join the Katanga secessionist movement. To
                            provide for his airlift, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            seized part of the Sabena airlines although some of these planes still
                            bore <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> markings. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that a [<hi rend="italic">less

                            in the Congo said that there are sixty Soviet satellite technicians in
                            the area, many of whom had previously been in Iraq. On August 22 a
                            Soviet vessel with a number of Soviet technicians and one hundred trucks
                            arrived in the <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0473"/>Congo. Czech

                            Several prominent Belgian Communists have arrived in the Congo to lay
                            the foundations for a Congolese Communist Party. Finally, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that as an aftermath of the
                            break-up of the Mali Federation, it appeared that the 566-man Mali
                            contingent of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in the Congo was
                            also splitting along Senegalese-Soudanese lines.” (Eisenhower Library,

                        <p>Earlier in the briefing, <persName>Dulles</persName> had noted that the

                            responsible for planning covert operations, met to discuss plans for an

                                that “if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and his
                                wired-in Communist advisors are not stopped by a policy of strength
                                we think this country is headed toward another China by way of
                                technicians instead of bayonets.” (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 770G.00/8–2460)</note> to him.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s observations on telegram were:
                            (a) he thought comment that “all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            military contingents bear witness to humiliations, etc.,” was slightly
                            exaggerated, (b) he agreed with essential idea behind telegram that
                            situation in Congo would not be straightened out until <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was dealt with, (c) he did not
                            feel he now had authority to disarm Force Publique as Timberlake
                            suggests, and (d) he thought situation in Congo had not yet gotten to
                            “China” stage.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> thinks issue in Congo must come to
                            crisis shortly and that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            must be “broken”. (He apparently has in mind that new crisis between
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in which <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> victorious, will under-cut <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s political power in Congo sufficiently that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> or Ileo will be able
                            to assume effective control.) He believes this crisis will develop after
                            end of current meeting of African leaders in Congo.</p>
                        <p>4. One way for crisis to develop would be effort by <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to take Leopoldville airport. He
                            showed <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> draft letter he
                            plans send <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in case
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> again demands to take
                            over control of airport. Substance of letter is that control of airport
                            by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is necessary to facilitate <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> responsibilities and that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will take “all necessary measures” to
                            protect its position there. (<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            believes that one way or another there will have to be some casualties
                            in Congo before situation cleared up. He is prepared to face this and
                            believes this is best way of preserving situation in long run.)</p>
                        <p>5. Other way crisis might develop, which he seemed this morning to
                            consider more likely in light of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s press statement today, would be <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> demand for immediate withdrawal
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops when Belgians were out.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he would treat this as
                            “formal request”, although he had information showing other Congo
                            leaders <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0475"/>would not favor it, and
                            he would have <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting. After <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> presented his demand <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would say in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> that Force Publique could in no circumstances maintain
                            peace and order in Congo and that withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> troops would undoubtedly lead to foreign intervention
                            and therefore to breach of peace. In order to avoid contributing itself
                            to breach of international peace <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must
                            therefore stay in Congo in fulfillment responsibilities under Article 42
                            of Charter (which provides for air, sea or land force action by <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to maintain or restore international
                            peace and security). He would plan to phrase his remarks in such a way
                            that in absence <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution calling for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> withdrawal, retention of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in Congo would have been endorsed.
                            He is confident that only <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                            introduce resolution calling for withdrawal and that it would be
                            defeated with only two favorable votes. He then would hope that other
                            members of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would refer to Article 42
                            in explaining their reasons for rejecting Soviet motion.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> believes that if <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attempted to take issue to <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> it would be defeated by vote of 70 to 12
                            and that they would therefore not attempt it. He also believes <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not intervene militarily in
                            Congo because other Africans states would be opposed to it. He said he
                            thought he was worth “five Lumumbas” to Russians. (He said until
                            recently he thought he had been worth ten Lumumbas to them.) Only way
                            for <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to interfere with continued
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation in Congo would therefore
                            be through “flag of convenience”. This would only be Guinea or Ghana. He
                            said Guinean troops had been so placed in Congo that they could not move
                            and could do no damage. He observed Guinea had only one other battalion
                            and that with current difficulties in Mali, Guinea would be unable to
                            take this out of country. Re Ghana, he saw signs it was beginning to
                            sober up and he noted that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            himself believed Force Publique should be disarmed.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that after <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> session of this sort <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would in effect be taking over control of
                            Congo and that he would then be in position to disarm Force Publique by
                            force if necessary. (<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said disarming
                            of some Force Publique units when <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            first arrived had come as result Congolese Government order but that
                            government had itself rearmed Force Publique units in Leopoldville
                            area.)</p>
                        <p>8. He thought Katanga problem could and must be resolved once <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was out of way and this crisis
                            had been passed. He said there was no Katanga problem between Tshombe
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> or Ileo but only with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. He is sending Cordier and General Rikhye (India) to Congo tonight and

                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>. He will be <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s personal representative, with Rikhye
                            second ranking of group. He described Rikhye as very much “our” (<gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) man and said <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> would be same. He said <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> would have same orientation as <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> and would be even more
                            forceful.</p>
                        <p>10. Commenting on other aspects of situation he said <persName

                            appointment with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> (Tunisia) had
                            unsuccessfully tried to see <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> for five days and was about to leave, that
                            Tunisian representatives were unable to get into opening session of
                            African leaders’ meeting and that Quaison-Sackey (Ghanaian Ambassador to

                        <p>545. Contemplating Soviet strategy from Leopoldville perspective, it
                            seems to me there is two-pronged attack. In view strong African states

                            wide enough crack for entering wedge. I have feeling they primarily

                            but this one is easier in some ways; Congolese are totally disorganized,
                            they are political children and only pitiful few have faintest idea
                            where <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is taking them. In
                            fact I feel sure even <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            fails realize where he is being led. Hence, I would expect Cuba time

                            to assert it has broken up into independent groups of armed savage

                            removed, I would favor the immediate acceptance of ah invitation to
                            start sending some troops home, starting, I suggest, with Guineans. I
                            think such action might just shock even <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> into a recognition of what his and the Congo’s
                            prospects would be and cause him to do an about-face. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could then demand, and I think obtain,
                            certain levers without which the economic and social programs being
                            planned cannot be carried out. One is mandate to officer and command
                            police and army until retrained and officered by competent Congolese.
                            Another would be the establishment of a judiciary of competent,
                            preferably African, judges and intensive training of Congolese
                            replacements at earliest time. At same time, we are receiving more and
                            more reports that the people are turning against <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. He may just be on his last
                            spectacular lap and it could not end too soon for me. His only
                            demonstrated skill is in attack and incitement. These tactics destroy;
                            what this country needs is reconstruction. Many more people will soon be
                            hungry. They will blame <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            who can be expected to blame <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In other

                                countries to establish a new framework for international assistance,

                        <p>DEAR MR. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">DILLON</persName>: The recent

                            the Force Publique at the Stanleyville Airport is a matter of grave
                            concern to the Department of Defense. This latest, and most aggravated,

                                <p>“The President first referred to the situation in the Congo. He
                                    thought that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must take the
                                    position that when it puts troops into an area, these troops
                                    must have the authority and instructions to defend themselves
                                    against mob violence. He asked the Secretary to have Ambassador
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> take this

                        <p>The immediate concern of the Department of Defense is for the safety of
                            the members of the U.S. forces, who are engaged in providing and
                            supporting the airlift of United Nations forces and equipment. I urge
                            that strong representation be made immediately to the Secretary-General
                            of the United Nations, looking to the proper security of airfields and
                            related facilities in the Congo. If assurances of adequate security
                            cannot be provided, it may become necessary to revamp our method of
                            providing operational support in the country, one example of which might
                            be to limit airlift operations to the Leopoldville area. A few U.S.
                            personnel who are engaged in support operations within the Congo have
                            small arms available, but have been instructed not to display these
                            weapons openly. Aircrews and other operational support personnel
                            heretofore have not had weapons available. Aircrews are being authorized
                            by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to have small arms in their aircraft for
                            the purpose of protecting themselves. A portion of the governing
                            instructions will stress the necessity for prudence and caution in the
                            display and use of these arms.<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Instructions

                        <p>The larger problem of restoring security and stability throughout the
                            Congo is a matter of equally grave concern. In this connection, we urge
                            that the U.S. Government should advocate that the United Nations take
                            immediate and positive steps to bring the Force Publique to an
                            acceptable state of discipline and control, and to establish effective
                            United Nations control over the fields, bases, ports and support
                            facilities within the country. If necessary, the Force Publique should
                            be disarmed, reorganized and retrained by the United Nations forces,
                            utilizing whatever degree of force may be required to accomplish this
                            task. In this connection, we are in complete agreement with the
                            assessment of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1"
                                >Timberlake</persName> that if the Force Publique is not at once

                        <p>It appears that the original purpose of the United Nations in entering
                            the Congo, viz., to restore public order, has become obscured, with the
                            result that the United Nations may, to borrow the burden of Ambassador

                            Ambassador explained that there were still 337 troops at Kamina awaiting
                            evacuation to Belgium and explained the delay as partially due
                            inadequacy facilities offered by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>.
                            He demonstrated keen resentment of Secretary General’s protest on

                        <p>Ambassador expressed his concern over the continuing reports of Soviet
                            activities in Congo, mentioning particularly heavy material unloaded
                            from Soviet planes at Luluabourg, unusual activities of members of

                            was at the very moment talking to the Secretary General about
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador said main purpose of call was to discuss future of Katanga. He
                            said if Katanga invaded, all Belgian civilians and technicians would
                            leave. He stressed the importance of loss not only to Belgium, but to
                            entire free world. He asked the US to use its influence <pb n="453"
                                xml:id="pg_453" facs="0483"/>with the Secretary General to maintain

                            which Katanga plays in economy of Congo and of importance its production
                            to Belgium, US and Free World. He also indicated he hoped Belgian
                            businessmen and technicians would be able to stay in Congo under secure
                            conditions. He mentioned that US of course was not now prepared to
                            recognize independence of Katanga. He said that he believed the
                            Ambassador would appreciate the difficulties in coping with covert
                            methods used by Soviets but that we could use our influence in two ways:
                            first on the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to be sure that he
                            would not agree to withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at
                            the unilateral request of Congo government; to reiterate position that

                            internal affairs; and to urge that law and order be maintained so that
                            technicians and others could live securely and free from attack. He said
                            secondly that we could use influence on African states, particularly
                            those contributing troops, in an effort to have them exert a moderating
                            influence on Congo government. He added that basically he felt we must
                            rely on judgment and efforts of Secretary General in handling this
                            matter. He agreed with Ambassador that we should make effort to prevent
                            introduction into Congo of war materials. In conclusion he paid tribute
                            to loyalty with which Belgian government had carried out its
                            responsibilities in Congo in complying with <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolutions and said that this had been a most honorable

                            <item>The Deteriorating Situation in the Republic of the Congo</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are concerned over the steadily
                            deteriorating situation in the Congo which had culminated in the attack
                            on an unarmed U.S. Air Force crew at Stanleyville on 27 August by armed
                            troops of the Congo Force Publique. They consider that unless <pb
                                n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0484"/>immediate forceful action is
                            taken by the United States to maintain U.S. and U.N. prestige, to
                            safeguard U.S. and U.N. personnel, and to insure the success of U.S.
                            activities in support of the U.N. in the Congo, a situation could
                            develop which not only might be ruinous to the United Nations but might
                            result in the Congo being taken over by Communist advisors and
                            technicians. Moreover, such a Communist take-over could appear to be
                            under U.N. sanction.</p>
                        <p>2. Efforts have been made without success to obtain directives which have
                            been issued by the Secretary General to Commander, U.N. Forces in the
                            Congo. In any event, it appears from reports made by the Secretary
                            General to the Security Council that the directives to U.N. forces are
                            negative or passive in nature resulting in U.N. forces accepting, in
                            most cases, situations conducive to public disorder. In contrast, it is
                            noted that in Coquilhatville the U.N. Moroccan Troops disarmed the Force
                            Publique and have been firm but kind to them and have given them
                            appropriate direction; the Ethiopians have taken similar action in Bunia
                            and Paulis.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff urgently recommend the following courses of
                            action be proposed to the Secretary of State for immediate
                            implementation:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Actions that should be taken by the U.N.:</p>
                        <p>(1) Issue to the U.N. Commander in the Congo a definite political and
                            military directive defining his mission and responsibilities so as to
                            require him to take positive action, rather than passive action, to
                            restore law and order and to maintain public safety.</p>
                        <p>(2) Take immediate effective control of all Congo air fields and harbor
                            facilities which are now being utilized or may be needed directly or
                            indirectly for the support of U.N. forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) Permit aid (material and personnel) to the Congolese Government only
                            through U.N. channels.</p>
                        <p>(4) Search all ships and planes upon arrival in the Congo to assure that
                            no arms, ammunition or unauthorized personnel are introduced into the
                            Congo.</p>
                        <p>(5) Assure the protection of all personnel and equipment being used by
                            members of the U.N. in support of U.N. operations in the Congo. This
                            should extend to the disarming of those members of the Force Publique
                            not cooperating with U.N. forces.</p>
                        <p>(6) Issue a strong protest to the Congolese Government for the attack on
                            the unarmed U.S. Air Force crew at Stanleyville on 27 August, and demand
                            guarantees against future incidents.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Actions that should be taken by the United
                            States:</p>
                        <p>(1) Assist, to the extent necessary, the U.N. operation in the Congo to
                            assure its ultimate success.</p>
                        <p>(2) Take necessary action through friendly governments to cause all
                            Soviet Bloc ships and planes enroute to the Congo to be searched in
                            order to inhibit introduction of arms and unauthorized personnel into
                            the Congo.</p>
                        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0485"/>
                        <p>(3) Take necessary steps, overtly and covertly, to identify unauthorized
                            foreign agents, particularly Communist Bloc personnel, currently in the
                            Congo and effect their expulsion from that country.</p>
                        <p>(4) Demand that the Congolese Government make compensation for injuries
                            suffered by U.S. personnel in the attack on the unarmed U.S. Air Force
                            crew at Stanleyville on 27 August.</p>
                        <p>(5) Take all feasible means to discredit and/or eliminate <persName

                            in the Congo and seek to support leaders responsive to U.N. guidance in
                            the establishment of an effective and acceptable Congolese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>(6) Send notes to other governments currently providing U.N. forces, and
                            all other friendly U.N. members, informing them of the above U.S.
                            action, and requesting that they also protest to the Congo Government,
                            and take action in the United Nations, in support of the U.S.

                            Force Publique could be undertaken. In light continuing reports
                            disorder, and particularly in view reprehensible attacks on American
                            crewmen Stanleyville, would be interested in learning from <gloss

                            strengthen general security situation. While we realize <gloss

                                >SC</gloss> resolutions have no specific authority disarm <gloss

                            would, we believe, have a salutary effect since leaderless Congolese
                            troops have shown no signs willingness resist firm display of authority.
                            In this connection their panic when Belgian paratroops intervened in
                            July might be recalled. In long run, ideal solution would be for <gloss

                            injected in <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> power position
                            with Soviets placing aircraft at his disposal. His military capability
                            clearly enhanced as result, and we greatly concerned at implication this

                            frustrate such moves and considers this highlights need to bring

                                >UN</gloss> control to maximum possible degree as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>We realize there is point beyond which <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> cannot go without legitimately being accused
                            interfering in internal Congolese affairs, but we would hope that broad
                            scope <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation would be considered by
                            him as sufficient grounds for obtaining effective control of airports in
                            Congo. Dept believes control of airports in Katanga particularly
                            crucial. It appears to us that since Elisabethville airport under
                            Tshombe’s control and Kamina under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            control, with orders restricting use Kamina base to planes on <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> business, that major question <pb n="457"
                                xml:id="pg_457" facs="0487"/>will be how to handle possible landings
                            of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> forces elsewhere in
                            Katanga. Accordingly request you explore with <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> what steps <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can take
                            to frustrate any such landings. Would be highly desirable if <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can control airports so as to minimize
                            military activities. We believe in light circumstances surrounding
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entry into Katanga, accomplished
                            on basis of assurances which in essence meant <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> presence would not be permitted to upset status quo,
                            special case can be made for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> insisting

                        <p>1. Hammarskjold asked to see me at 6 p.m. tonight. As background for what

                            in same terms of “pointed inquiry” re Belgian officers serving in
                            Katanga forces, questioning their status, etc.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> then produced cable from Cordier
                            stamped “top secret” (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> usage) and read
                            selected sentences aloud. Congo Prime Minister-designate, Ileo, had
                            called on Cordier Sunday night to discuss situation. In course their
                            conversation Ileo apparently demonstrated astonishing naivete re game
                            Russians are playing in Congo and Cordier had to assume professorial
                            role. Moreover, Cordier gained impression US impact in Congolese eyes
                            suffered by comparison with Soviet.</p>
                        <p>3. Main point for US in Cordier’s cable was his “urgent recommendation”
                            that US send someone “not too high level, not too junior” to
                            Leopoldville to arrive with certain amount of fanfare. He would be able
                            observe local scene, see what Soviets are up to, and make first-hand
                            report to Washington. Hammarskjold stressed this was Cordier’s
                            recommendation, based on close touch with local scene, and he (<gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>) passed it along without making any
                            recommendation himself, although he said he felt Cordier had good
                            judgment in matters this kind.</p>
                        <p>4. We then briefly discussed <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s ideas
                            as to future steps. He said his primary objective now is to “explode”
                            what Soviets are up to. To do this he feels <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>’s hands must be “absolutely clean”. He said Soviets
                            “know what Belgians are doing in Katanga,” and will probably cite that
                            to him in response his veiled protest re their planes and crews.</p>
                        <p>5. He characterized Soviet plan in following terms: To play their role
                            they needed a Katanga problem and a “bad boy.” UN had, there-fore, to
                            try to remove these justifications. Fact unfortunately was that Belgians
                            were playing too many “childish tricks”, which made clear Katanga was
                            not simply an “internal” matter. He showed me further exchanges with
                            Belgian <gloss target="#t_Del1">Del</gloss> and with FonMin Wigny
                            indicating 650 paratroopers still at Kitona, as well as two gun boats at
                            Matadi, despite assurances total withdrawal would, and later, had taken
                            place. He renews his protest to Belgian Government for this. These
                            exchanges <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0489"/>are soon to be
                            published as further addenda to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s

                        <p>6. In this connection I referred to facts and figures provided by Defense
                            in its memo re <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> airlifting
                            departing Belgian troops (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>
                                308).<note n="7" xml:id="d198fn7">Dated September 2. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, 770G.5445/8–3160)</note> He said he would be
                            pleased to have these “for the record.” He pointed out in latest Belgian
                            letter US Air Force fares better, and blame for delay now placed
                            (totally unjustifiably) onto <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s
                            shoulders.</p>
                        <p>7. With regard to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s approach to
                            Belgians re their officers in Katanga forces, I mentioned Department’s
                            concern for “security implications” should these Belgian elements, by
                            leaving, precipitate new wave of flights by remaining European
                            population. In reply <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> indicated
                            doubts Belgian officers in Katanga would actually be withdrawn as result
                            his approach. However, he thought 4,000-man <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> force in Katanga provided more basic security for
                            non-African population of Katanga than did Tshombe’s five hundred-man
                            army. He said if Belgians and other Europeans did flee Katanga, gap they
                            created could well be filled by Russians and their friends, which would
                            be something Soviets might really like to have. Hammarskjold stressed in
                            this, as in all things relative to Congo, matters are excessively
                            delicate, and every step he takes is by choosing lesser risk.</p>
                        <p>8. As I was leaving, further cable arrived from Cordier containing texts
                            of three notes to Cordier from <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>, asking <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                            guard his (<persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>) office and
                            residence, to be responsible for law and order, and to close all
                            airfields throughout Congo. Hammarskjold then showed me only instruction
                            he had thus far sent to Cordier since new developments, which said
                            simply that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces already responsible
                            for law and order in Congo.</p>
                        <p>9. Later at Department’s suggestion I put two questions to <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> re Cordier recommendation:</p>
                        <p>a. How did he relate Cordier’s recommendation to later developments, as
                            far as urgency, etc. concerned?</p>
                        <p>b. How could he relate sending of US official, at this time, to whatever
                            action he is planning to take?</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he would like “chew” over
                            these, and called me back late tonight. He said he was sure Cordier had,
                            as result his conversation with Ileo, anticipated something going to
                            happen, but it probably developed more broadly than expected. Things
                            still being “touch and go” at moment, <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> felt question of whether US should do this needed
                            further consideration, particularly because of timing. “Be <pb n="460"
                                xml:id="pg_460" facs="0490"/>damn careful on the timing; you don’t
                            want to kill off a good, new man who is at least anti-East if not
                            pro-West.” As example of what not to do, he referred to quoted comment
                            on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> today by Belgian
                            FonMin Wigny, to effect “We hail him.” Should US Government decide to
                            act upon Cordier’s recommendation, Hammarskjold expressed strong desire
                            to be in the picture, and in effect to be consulted on timing. He
                            suggested no action be taken until tomorrow, and most which then should
                            happen would be announcement Mr. X would arrive in Congo in couple of
                            days.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows the first portion of <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName>’ briefing on unrelated subjects.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> began his briefing on the Congo by noting
                            the difficulties involved in keeping up to date on the situation there.
                            He stated that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s move to
                            throw out <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been
                            undertaken without adequate planning. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>’s move had produced consternation among his
                            aides and advisers who had planned it for two days later. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> observed that it was not easy to run a
                            coup in the Congo. As an indication of the lack of planning, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that for a time <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> had controlled the radio in
                            Leopoldville, but that when he left the radio station it was left
                            unguarded. As a result <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was
                            able to enter the station and to make an impassioned <pb n="461"
                                xml:id="pg_461" facs="0491"/>appeal to the people. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s ability to influence the
                            Congolese people, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> observed, was greater
                            than that of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Senate President Ileo, whom <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had selected to replace <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, is Western-oriented. At last
                            report, Ileo was in <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s
                            house with a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guard protecting him.
                            There was a report that some pro-<persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> troops were moving into Leopoldville. This, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated, might change the picture.
                            There was also a report that morning that the Congo’s Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs had gone to the U.S. Embassy to seek asylum. At last
                            report, the U.S. Ambassador had engaged him in a conversation but it was
                            not clear whether he had been given asylum. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> interjected to say that we had

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> referred to the savage tribal warfare
                            raging in Kasai Province. He went on to say that Tshombe was
                            strengthening his army, increasing it from 1100 to 3000 men. Tshombe, he
                            also indicated, had a fair amount of Belgian matériel. He noted that ten
                            IL–14 Soviet transports were being used to bring <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s forces to Kasai Province. He
                            noted that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had taken over the
                            airport at Leopoldville, but that it was not in effective control of
                            other airfields in the country, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            presently on their way to Stanleyville. These transports had by-passed
                            Athens and had gone by way of the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Consulate had issued visas for
                            83 persons but more might be aboard. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            stated that two merchant ships had unloaded 100 trucks, food and other
                            supplies at Matadi. Two hundred Bloc personnel were now in the Congo,
                            exclusive of air crews. There were fifteen Bloc physicians and five Bloc
                            nurses. Other offers of personnel had been made. Concluding this part of
                            his briefing, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> always seemed to come out on top
                            in each of these struggles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> noted that the Congo was
                            scheduled as an item on the Council agenda and asked Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> whether he wished to say
                            anything on the subject. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said he had very little to add. Hammarskjold, he
                            noted, had made a formal protest to the Soviets. Hammarskjold was
                            disturbed by the possibility that the Soviet fliers <pb n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462" facs="0492"/>were military personnel engaged in
                            military operations. If this were the case, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> could move against them. If these were peaceful
                            operations, however, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could not
                            move. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> asked whether
                            Hammarskjold was prepared to move. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he thought so. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that the Soviets were
                            engaged in carrying troops into the Congo. Secretary <persName

                            bringing arms into the Congo by plane. Secretary <persName

                                >Lumumba</persName>’s office. In course hour and half session we
                            were joined by Deputy Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_GA4"
                                >Gizenga</persName> (who like dormouse, slept through most of

                            called in Russian, Moroccan and “several other Ambassadors in order to
                            explain his position”. Made following points.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s action completely
                            unexpected. They had met only last Saturday<note n="1" xml:id="d200fn1"
                                >September 3.</note> discuss certain matters and Chief of State had
                            given no indication lack of confidence.</p>
                        <p>2. In any case action quite illegal. Then followed long exposé his
                            version fundamental law particularly article 20, requiring such an
                            action be signed by responsible Minister. Prime Minister said only
                            written notice of action he had yet received was signed original of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s radio speech which
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, had by chance found
                            at the radio station. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Kasavubu has claimed
                            he has signature two Ministers but not clear what he has done with

                        <p>3. He was forced to conclusion this was Belgian-French plot (because
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has a Belgian and a
                            French advisor) but more important <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                            in it from beginning. When I asked him if he had any proof of this he
                            said only circumstantial, viz (A) fact Ghanaian troops led by white
                            officer had tried prevent him from speaking on radio night before, (B)
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had closed all airports preventing
                            central government from carrying out functions; in fact General Lundula
                            who was en route from Stanleyville may well have crashed owing <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> refusal let him land here. (Have since
                            learned Lundula’s IL–14 made it to Brazzaville and Lundula now
                            Leopoldville.)</p>
                        <p>This led to long discussion US, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Congo during which I
                            pointed out US felt <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> best guarantor new
                            country’s integrity therefore US had given <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> massive financial support, assistance whereas Russians
                            had attempted to sabotage by acting bilaterally and that this could only
                            result in involving Congo in East-West struggle to country’s detriment.
                            He said he had asked both US and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                            planes but had been turned down so was forced to accept them from
                            Russians. It was obvious that he obsessed with idea of airplanes and
                            that nothing that has been done by US or <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> has made much impression.</p>
                        <p>4. He expressed confidence that the great majority of the peoples and the
                            troops supported him and said <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had only been made President with his support.
                            The matter would have to be considered by the Parliament and meanwhile
                            the Council of Ministers had assumed the prerogatives of the Chief of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>5. I told him that I had always conceived it my duty to speak to him
                            frankly and reiterated my view that accepting unilateral assistance from
                            Soviets not in long-run interest of Congo which had already been pledged

                        <p>1. Wieschhoff (Secretariat) late this afternoon reviewed recent events in
                            Congo and told us <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s intention to
                            issue report to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> tonight<note n="1"

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Wieschhoff confirmed ticker reports that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> back as PM and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> as Pres. He said he understood negotiations
                            behind scenes had taken place between two and resulted in agreement on
                            part <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> not to call in
                            outside aid. He also reported FonMin <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> had resigned. In response our characterization
                            of these events as <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            victory, Wieschhoff expressed opinion it “not necessarily outright
                            victory” for <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>; it still too
                            early to tell what effects of recent events would be.</p>
                        <p>3. Wieschhoff said <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, after

                                >UN</gloss>) whom Cordier (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) sent
                            to talk with him concerning “next steps.” Wieschhoff questioned
                            rhetorically, How can you make a revolution with such material?”</p>
                        <p>4. We pressed Wieschhoff as to why <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            troops had not been used to keep pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> members of Force Publique off streets and away
                            from Parliament. Wieschhoff replied there were limits as to how far
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could stretch its authority. Such
                            action by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force would have been too
                            clearly intervention in internal affairs. We said it was our
                            understanding that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had recognized
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s constitutional
                            right to dismiss his <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>; <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> was therefore <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> and had right to request <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> keep Force Publique off streets as part
                            of its assistance in maintenance of law and order.</p>
                        <p>5. Wieschhoff said he could understand this line of argument but repeated
                            difficulty of acting effectively when <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> “went to bed” and Ileo took no action. We
                            expressed view <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should not have gone
                            half-way against <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>; seemed
                            to produce disadvantages of interference without desired results.
                            Wieschhoff said <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had planned mount
                            massive display of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force at Parliament
                            during its deliberation. He did not know how this had turned out. (Later
                            Wieschhoff called back to say Force Publique has been welcomed by “both
                            sides.” There was no occasion for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                            act against it.)</p>
                        <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>6. Wieschhoff then told us of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s
                            intention to issue report to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> about
                            midnight for distribution tomorrow morning. He said it will stress great
                            need in Congo for financial aid (Wieschhoff mentioned figure of $200
                            million) and contain suggested draft res appealing to all members to
                            contribute to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> fund. <gloss
                                target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> would also reaffirm <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate in Congo, making it “little
                            stronger” than previously. <gloss target="#t_Res1">Res</gloss> would
                            make point that financial aid cannot, standing by itself, be effective;
                            along with [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] provisions against introduction
                            of outside force. Finally res will state <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> cannot stand by while civil rights violated. Wieschhoff
                            expressed view such res if pushed would be difficult to veto and if
                            vetoed responsibility would be clear. He said <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> probably ask for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_mtg1">mtg</gloss> to be Friday. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is seeing Slim (Tunisia) tonight to
                            discuss situation.</p>
                        <p>7. In response our personal estimation that situation looked very bleak,
                            Wieschhoff said there was one bright note in picture—10 Soviet Ilyushin
                            planes now effectively grounded Stanleyville. He said Cordier had
                            reported that plan to block planes now effective, 18 hours after it
                            ordered into effect; Ethiopian troops being concentrated at Stanleyville
                            from outlying areas in order strengthen <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> control. He said if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s
                            airport control can be maintained, that will be one important gain.</p>

                        <p>1. From recent conversations with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and

                            Wallner yesterday, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> admitted at end
                            that what he was trying to do was get rid of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> without compromising <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            actions. (He compared his activities to “gamesmanship—how to win without

                            conversation Hammarskjold referred to acts which he had just authorized
                            which he characterized as “extra-constitutional.” He is clearly
                            concerned about this aspect of his operation though he seemed determined
                            to act effectively to utmost extent he considers possible.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> told Wallner while he would
                            recognize, deal with, and by implication strongly support <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> in his struggle with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, possibility had to be borne in
                            mind that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> might win the
                            fight. In that eventuality <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would
                            have be able explain and justify his actions to <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> and possibly <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> made it clear if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should survive and request
                            immediate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> withdrawal, <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would not accept request but would take
                            matter immediately to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. At that point
                            he would, of course, have to be able to justify his actions.</p>
                        <p>3. This attitude on part of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> helps to
                            explain his impatience with what he considers extreme Belgian
                            shortsightedness in not completing withdrawal their troops as they have
                            said they would do and as they have even on occasion said was already
                            done. He and Wieschhoff have both emphasized importance of taking away
                            Belgian troop issue from <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            and Soviets. This has been fundamental point in <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss>’s strategy from start. In his conversation with Wallner
                            Hammarskjold referred to problem he presented to us Monday night (<gloss
                                target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 586),<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">
                                <ref target="#d198">Document 198</ref>.</note> problem of Belgian
                            troops not only at Kamina but also and even more embarrassingly, at
                            Kitona. Paratroop battalion at Kitona, <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> emphasized, had not previously been reported at all, in
                            contradiction to Belgian declarations of complete withdrawal.
                            Hammarskjold said he believed (he and Wieschhoff have repeated this on
                            many occasions) Belgian Foreign Office is not responsible for “Belgian
                            lies” on withdrawal. He believes this is doing of Belgian Defense
                            Department, local commanders and “local interests.” But, he observed,
                            situation has gotten to point where no one believes anything that is
                            said about troop withdrawal unless <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            says it.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> feels failure of Belgians to
                            complete withdrawal as promised has greatly weakened his position in
                            combatting intervention of Soviets. He noted to Wallner that <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decisions are specifically directed
                            against presence of Belgian troops and he has specific mandate in that
                            regard. However, nothing in resolutions themselves forbids Soviet Union
                            supplying airplanes at request of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>.
                            (In this connection <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said his
                            approach to Russians had dealt solely with matter of Russian crews and
                            personnel, not with planes themselves.) He feels he is prevented from
                            taking as strong action as he would like against Russian intervention
                            because of what he considers to be Belgian double dealing in keeping
                            military personnel in Congo.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>5. Wallner drew attention of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to
                            danger that removing all Belgian military personnel from Katanga might
                            lead to exodus of Belgian civilian technical personnel. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s reply was Belgians using this threat
                            as kind of blackmail as they have all along. He referred to Belgian
                            claim that whites would flee if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            came into Katanga; <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> noted 170 women
                            and children out of 20,000 whites had left. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said threat of whites leaving had recently been put to
                            one of his aides in Katanga. Reply given was, “in that case, <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would have to operate [garble]”. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> commented this had been just right
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>6. Wallner expressed to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> our desire to
                            be helpful and avoid any action which might complicate SYG’s efforts. At
                            same time we were very concerned at growing Soviet infiltration with
                            both men and airplanes. In response to question from Wallner, <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we had read

                            paper of September 2 on the Congo. He pointed out that we have been

                            by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. He observed that we had to
                            give the Secretary-General full marks on his initiative, clarity of

                            Russians out of the Congo. He said as a result of the Congo it could be
                            that we were moving into a serious crisis in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> which might conceivably result in a blow-up of that

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> asked what happened
                            if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> votes to dissolve its forces in
                            the Congo. Does this mean we would move in?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that was
                            planned.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said that the
                            Chiefs were puzzled over who should supervise contingency planning for
                            the Congo. They wondered whether this should be done by <gloss

                                target="#t_CINCLANT1">CINCLANT</gloss> or in Washington. He said
                            there have been some political repercussions on CINCEUR’s activities in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> ferrying operations in the Congo
                            but that after all he was the unified commander for the African area.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> wondered whether
                            it would be feasible to do this planning in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said his immediate
                            reaction was there was a great difference between the CINCEUR ferrying
                            operation for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and unilateral
                            military operations. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                            done on this side of the ocean.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that in the
                            African mind <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and colonialism are
                            synonymous.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> observed that
                            CINCEUR would have information on the entire African area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that the
                            most important element in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                            was the Ghanaian army and he pointed out that a number of African
                            countries continued to be affected by the Algerian situation.</p>
                        <p>General Shoup referred to the Indonesian troops which were on their way
                            to the Congo and wondered how we could keep them under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He expressed the fear that they would be
                            for <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> admitted that this
                            was a risk but that Hammarskjold had picked his governments carefully
                            and that we would have to rely on Hammarskjold’s efforts to keep these
                            troops loyal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith observed that the Indonesian army was the strongest
                            anti-communist force in that country.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> wondered how it
                            would be possible to keep the Russians from getting into the Congo. He
                            questioned the optimism expressed in the meeting on the Congo’s future.
                            He asked whether <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops have orders to
                            keep the Russians out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that was
                            the purpose of the Security Council meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2"

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said the most
                            important element in his mind was the necessity for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control of the airports and harbors.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> agreed and said
                            that if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> port commanders had more
                            explicit orders they could help calm the situation. For example, with
                            explicit orders the port commanders could stop Russian airplanes and
                            ships.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said the important
                            thing was to make this all an issue with the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> on the one hand and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> on the other.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operations in Korea had been most
                            successful and he hoped the lessons learned there could be applied in
                            the Congo.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said we should make
                            sure that all aid to the Congo was channeled through <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said this would be
                            impossible to get through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because
                            the other African nations would object to this precedent being
                            established.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGTD1">White</persName> said he just didn’t
                            understand how the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operated. He said
                            there didn’t seem to be any central direction. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot be effective until all members
                            recognized it as a supra-national body.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> couldn’t be genuinely effective as long
                            as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was in the

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said the
                            nations ought to agree that all aid to the Congo should go through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said we could
                            take all steps to encourage this concept but that it would be
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said in Korea
                            we did not let arms come in unilaterally. In the Congo a Swedish general
                            is in charge and so why couldn’t he be authorized to search the Russian
                            planes and ships for arms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that
                            Hammarskjold would like to have this authority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> observed that
                            Hammarskjold was walking simultaneously on half a dozen tightropes. He
                            said that Hammarskjold didn’t want to force some of these issues and
                            that he wanted a broad resolution giving him freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> thought the
                            whole operation was inefficient.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said it wasn’t only a
                            problem of Russia but also of Belgium.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> wondered why that
                            was, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>
                            replied that the Belgians hadn’t told Hammarskjold that they still had
                            troops in the Congo. Hammarskjold was quite upset to learn that there
                            were 650 paratroops there when the Belgians said they had departed. He
                            said the only pressure we could exercise on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> was by Hammarskjold keeping the general support of the

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> wondered what

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he would check

                            was his impression that they were carrying the African story as straight

                            voting was so heavily pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> agreed his forces
                            were afraid since <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had
                            control major portion military and police. Senators had been afraid to
                            vote against <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Harriman
                            made point that such parliamentary victory indicated to outside world
                            that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was being supported
                            by government.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> declared Force Publique
                            should be disarmed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He stated
                            although many soldiers loyal to him, <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had succeeded converting army into political
                            weapon by placing his friends in <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0502"
                            />key positions. Once disarmed it should be reorganized by General
                            Kettani through whom he believed he could successfully reorient the
                            army.</p>
                        <p>4. Chief of State believes <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should
                            protest and take countermeasures against unilateral military aid which
                            Soviets are bringing into Congo. He was glad that by closing down
                            airfields, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had prevented Soviet planes
                            from operating in country during past few days.</p>
                        <p>5. He declared <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was
                            surrounded by Communist advisers and that Prime Minister was in frequent
                            contact with both Czech and Russian advisers.</p>
                        <p>6. Following his Monday night declaration dismissing <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, he had received messages of
                            support from Tshombe, Kalonji and Bolikango as well as other political
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>7. Harriman pointed out events last few days indicated <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was getting stronger and asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> what his plans were
                            to counter-attack <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> was nonplussed and
                            asked for advice. I pointed out Congolese themselves and not outsiders
                            had to resolve their own internal struggle for power. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and friendly foreign countries could help
                            only up to a point and that essence of independence was resolution of
                            own governmental problems.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> believed Tshombe could
                            successfully defend Katanga against central government force who are not
                            organized and who, in attacking Katanga and Kasai, would be spread
                            thin.</p>
                        <p>9. He declared <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was evil
                            influence on country and Prime Minister was responsible for malaise and
                            agitation which had happened since independence. So long as <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> remained in power such
                            perturbation would continue thereby causing country to flounder deeper
                            into political and economic anarchy.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> agreed with my
                            analysis that in order bring about peace and security, <gloss
                                target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> and police should be disarmed and courts
                            should be set up and organized. These three elements at present time are
                            major contributors to atmosphere of anarchy throughout country.</p>

                                which he viewed as a lack of solidarity. He argued that the only way
                                to restore a pro-Western Congo was through Katanga and that if civil
                                war was not prevented, there would be a “tragic loss” for the West
                                in the center of Africa, with the Soviets and their allies moving
                                in. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> Suggest you convey to De

                            forum.</p>
                        <p>Believe Wigny–De Staercke approach offers opportunity for another general
                            presentation of current US thinking on Congo problem. You therefore
                            should draw on following material for discussion with De Staercke.</p>
                        <p>US policy on Congo remains essentially as presented to <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> by Ambassador Burden in early
                            August (Brussels 395 rptd Paris 176).<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">See

                            Subsequent events have demonstrated soundness this position and in
                            particular have justified our faith in <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss>’s ability deal with situation. US has been increasingly
                            concerned at <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s actions and
                            at growing Soviet influence in Congo. We have brought our concern to
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s attention on numerous
                            occasions and have been gratified to see concrete steps he has recently
                            taken in Congo to counter this influence.</p>
                        <p>On bases, US believes Belgian-<gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            agreement covers present situation. Agree with Belgium that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control of bases should in no way
                            prejudice eventual disposition. Obviously in West’s interests to deny
                            bases to unfriendly elements. US hopes eventual bilateral solution
                            between Belgium and Congo on disposition bases will be successful in
                            this regard.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Katanga, US continues believe thrust <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> activities should not be directed to undermining
                            Tshombe’s or Katanga’s position or, conversely, to facilitate <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s entry into Katanga. Recent <pb
                                n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0504"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions to gain control airports
                            should be effective in this regard On other hand, Tshombe’s recent
                            reported criticism of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for taking
                            control of base in Katanga not helpful to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>’s or Katanga’s cause.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we must point out unfortunate effects press announcements re
                            Belgian arms shipments to Katanga and we have already mentioned to
                            Belgian Embassy here. This, coupled with reported continued presence
                            Belgian paratroopers Kitona, makes it more difficult to take away club
                            of troop issue from <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and
                            Soviets. Lastly, we hope <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            situation will somehow unfold so that general Congolese agreement to
                            establish looser federal structure might become possible.</p>
                        <p>We continue hope Belgian civilians will have major role to play in Congo
                            future and that Belgian contribution to economic life there can be
                            maintained. We have spoken to Secretary General along these lines and he
                            has indicated his agreement.</p>
                        <p>Finally, U.S. has been deeply concerned at strains in U.S.-Belgian bonds
                            friendship as well as indications Belgian disappointment with <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as result unfortunate events in
                            Congo. We trust Belgium shares our desire to repair damage and to
                            maintain traditional close friendly relations with U.S. as well as to
                            support fully <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> objectives. We are
                            certain that, despite Belgian disappointment at certain positions U.S.
                            has taken, Belgium, like ourselves, believes overriding goal must be to
                            keep Congo from falling under bloc influence. Keeping in mind delicacy
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role, as well as importance not
                            losing support other African states, this has been throughout underlying
                            U.S. motivation.</p>

                                Wadsworth read the papers transmitted in this telegram and the
                                Secretary-General commented on them. The telegram stated in part:
                                “He still convinced he must break <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                    >Lumumba</persName> and believes he will be able to do it. He
                                commented it was extremely difficult “to break Hitlers when
                                alternatives were Hindenbergs.”” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.) The
                                conversation took place prior to the Security Council meeting of

                                asked the Council to declare explicitly that all assistance to the
                                Congo should be channeled through the United Nations, see U.N. doc.

                        <p>a. U.S. Govt continues stand behind you in supporting <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s effort to oust <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and, in spite setback of last
                            few days, hopes you can take further action to reinforce his
                            position.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position would obviously have to be
                            in support Congolese constitution. Our lawyers have concluded <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s action to remove <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> govt was taken in accordance
                            with constitution, while later Chamber and Senate actions were
                            extra-constitutional. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            attempt to usurp office of Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of army
                            provides strong constitutional justification for counter action. We hope
                            you can proceed on basis of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> action and on basis <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> legally removed from office.</p>
                        <p>c. Normal procedure would now be for <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> to propose another cabinet for parliamentary
                            approval. We think he would stand excellent chance of obtaining this
                            approval after some time for maneuver if you can give following
                            instructions to <gloss target="#t_ONUC1">ONUC</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>1) <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, Ileo, Bolikango and
                            others to be afforded <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> protection.</p>
                        <p>(2) Parliament building security to be taken over by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) Leopoldville police and <gloss target="#t_FP1">FP</gloss> to be
                            disarmed (immobilized in some other way, or shifted in allegiance). The
                            Congolese Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>
                            has kept contact with others in <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> s camp and may be favorable to such
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>d. We think <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s demand for
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> withdrawal offers suitable
                            opportunity to you to act.</p>
                        <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0506"/>
                        <p>e. Subsequently we think constituent assembly should be convened with
                            protection assured all participants. This might solve Katanga problem
                            also on basis acceptable to govt, Tshombe and African states. Tshombe’s
                            recent expressions of desire for reunited but federal state should
                            help.</p>
                        <p>f. If you are willing take action along these lines we will exert all
                            practicable influence on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            and other Congolese leaders.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II Action in SC</p>
                        <p>On current <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action, U.S. views are:</p>
                        <p>a. We hope you will say in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, as you told
                            us earlier you were planning to, that Force Publique is obviously unable
                            maintain peace and order in Congo and withdrawal of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops would undoubtedly lead to foreign
                            intervention and breach of peace.</p>
                        <p>b. We continue think best course of action is to phrase your remarks and
                            handling of situation so, in absence of resolution calling for
                            withdrawal, retention of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops will
                            be endorsed. Final key, of course, is whether African troops will
                            remain. We are prepared give you any support you feel is required on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>c. While we think retention of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force in
                            Congo is primary objective, we would also like see further results as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) Reiteration of call to states against steps which would impede law
                            and order, as you have already included in your draft resolution of
                            yesterday. We would prefer it even be more pointed. (We want to
                            strengthen your hand against Soviet intervention and will give strong
                            statement on this at appropriate point.)</p>
                        <p>(2) We would like paragraph calling on you to intensify efforts to
                            restore law and order in Congo and take such further steps as you may
                            deem necessary.</p>
                        <p>(3) If you think resolution incorporating these points would be vetoed,
                            we would think resolution approving your report and requesting you
                            intensify your efforts and take further steps implement your
                            recommendations would be good idea.</p>
                        <p>d. We hope you will keep close touch with <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and France about Belgian problem so as avoid situation

                            hour and a half. He reiterated points made to me September 6 reported

                        <p>In addition Prime Minister stated:</p>
                        <p>1. Despite obstructions by Belgians, he had won resounding victory at
                            polls last May. If elections were held today he would obtain support 80
                            percent population.</p>
                        <p>2. He was not communist and was not surrounded by Russian or communist
                            advisers. To him communist dictatorship was as bad as colonialism. As he
                            had previously stated numerous occasions he wished Congo to steer policy
                            of neutralism between East and West blocs.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> had been egged on by
                            Belgian and French advisers when he tried dismiss <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as Prime Minister. Now that he
                            had received overwhelming support from population and parliament, Prime
                            Minister was soon going to take steps resolve <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> question. He stated country had never desired
                            establishment of country with Chief of State, rather it preferred type
                            of government headed by working President.</p>
                        <p>4. He did not like idea of all countries channeling their aid through
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This would make Congo subservient
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. As sovereign nation Congo should

                        <p>5. He was not happy with action taken by <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> in closing down airfields and radio station. Also he had

                        <p>The Secretary telephoned Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                >Hammarskjöld</persName> that we were with him 1000% and
                            Hammarskjold said he was very grateful for this. The Secretary asked
                            where we could be the most useful<note n="1" xml:id="d208fn1">In a
                                conversation with Wadsworth 10 minutes earlier, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> had suggested having a
                                resolution introduced censuring <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                    >Hammarskjöld</persName> for the closure of the airports and
                                radio stations by the U.N. force in the Congo (which the Yugoslav
                                Representative at the Security Council meeting had criticized) in
                                order to have a vote on the issue. When Wadsworth objected that he
                                couldn’t visualize who would propose such a resolution, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> suggested that the United
                                States might do it. Both Wadsworth and Wilcox, who was also on the
                                line, expressed doubts about this tactic, which they thought would
                                be perceived as an effort to censure <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                    >Hammarskjöld</persName>. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note>
                            and Hammarskjold said for the moment it was very difficult to say.
                            Hammarskjold said the most curious thing of the day was the reported
                            voluntary disarming of the Congolese. He said he had not yet had a full
                            report on it but it was a fact. He also said there was a one-sided truce
                            in Kasai. He said they were in the middle of the stream and found it
                            very difficult to know how to play it. He felt they should go ahead with
                            the discussions so they could get out in the clear. On this point he had
                            had a talk with Slim and his view was that we should go ahead and that
                            we could get a kind of stand-still agreement. Hammarskjold said if he
                            could get in touch with the Secretary later he might have something to
                            discuss with him. Hammarskjold said that he was going to mention in a
                            restrained way the manner in which the other side was playing it. The
                            Sec. said he didn’t want the impression <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479"
                                facs="0509"/>to go out that there was any vacillation in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Hammarskjold said that would be
                            extremely dangerous. He said there was no weakening so far. The
                            situation had never been tougher than yesterday. The Secretary referred
                            to the Soviet statements that Hammarskjold had done the wrong thing on
                            the radio stations and airports. Hammarskjold said that the whole issue
                            might be put before a special session of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>, and that he would not be afraid of that because he
                            felt he would get 60 or 70 votes which would be enough.</p>

                                >Kasavubu</persName> is unquestionably head of state, and outside

                            view that since <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was

                            authority to interpret law belongs to Parliament; however, in present
                            circumstances, resolutions passed last week by Lower House and Senate
                            clearly extra-constitutional. Any vote by Parliament which purported
                            overrule Chief of State’s dismissal of <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            would be tantamount to amending constitution, and would obviously
                            distort Art. 51. Only way in which Parliament could in effect disapprove
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s dismissal of

                            would be if it refused to approve <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"

                        <p>2. In light foregoing, and since it clearly in our interest support
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> over <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, we would strongly prefer have
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agree hear <persName

                            we would have no objection to having Kanza<note n="5" xml:id="d209fn5"

                            equality, since this would tend undermine our position and that of
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> has acted legally. Therefore, you should
                            consult urgently with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and Slim to
                            see if agreement can be reached hear <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> as legal representative <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> and Kanza as private individual. You should press
                            forward on this line if Tunisia will support or acquiesce in this as
                            reasonable, but not over strong objection of Tunisia and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Credentials of representatives clearly procedural matter and we assume
                            seven affirmative votes can be mustered in favor above course even if
                            Tunisia did not feel it could vote affirmatively for <persName

                            Kanza. We naturally prefer not to put <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and Slim in unduly awkward position. If they object
                            strongly to foregoing course, then next preferable alternative would be
                            to hear neither party. We prefer first course because it would tend
                            further enhance status <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            but since <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> and Kanza would
                            presumably make about equally effective presentation their respective
                            cases, probably not much would be lost in substance of debate if neither
                            party heard.</p>

                        <p>3. If <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> is unwilling go along
                            with either of above courses, and insists strongly that both <persName

                            without prejudice to constitutional issue, you should reluctantly agree,

                        <p>363. Re Congo. On basis of behind scenes consultations that you have
                            reported telephonically to Dept, we have impression that there is danger
                            that Council will begin to drift primarily because of variety and
                            gradation of views among Africans, <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            members and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. We agree with your
                            assessment, as communicated to us telephonically, on need for US take
                            steps at appropriate time to bring about crystallization of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on desirable course of action.</p>
                        <p>Our objectives are three-fold: (a) To have Council take action which
                            would help <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> vis-à-vis
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, or at least to avoid
                            steps which could affect situation adversely in this regard; (b) To
                            strengthen <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s mandate so that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can take further vigorous steps in Congo;
                            and (c) To focus on Soviet activities outside of framework with a view
                            to mobilizing opinion against them and reinforcing existing <gloss

                        <p>To this end, we believe you should press <persName corresp="#p_SM8"

                            purposes with <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName>, <gloss

                            needs to be strengthened. To this end, you can suggest any of following
                            which you find helpful tactically: (1) res include specific
                            recommendation that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> disarm Force

                            (3) that res, in addition to operative para 3, contains specific
                            injunction against <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, along lines of
                            last operative para of short res <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>
                            telephoned to Dept this morning, i.e. calling on states to refrain from
                            sending personnel, supplies or equipment of military nature into Congo
                            other than through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; (4) res call on

                            administration of justice in Congo; and (5) that phrase “while not being
                            entitled to intervene or be used to influence the outcome of any
                            internal conflict” be deleted from operative para 4 of Tunisian draft
                            res. We realize attempt include some or all of foregoing would run
                            serious risk Soviet veto, and consider key to avoiding this is <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName>’s attitude, i.e. any res which Slim
                            can support affirmatively will be very difficult for <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to veto. Therefore, in last analysis,
                            question of what traffic will bear depends in large degree on Tunisian
                            position. It occurs to us one way to strengthen present <gloss

                                >Slim</persName>’s support and minimum risk Soviet veto would be to
                            approve latest <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> report to <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We hope substantive res can be put forward at appropriate time so that
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s hand can be strengthened and
                            Council can reaffirm clearly its decision to keep outside powers from
                            intervening in Congo in a manner contrary to <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> resolutions. In this connection, we believe idea
                            presently being discussed in New York calling for establishment of a
                            good offices committee should be strongly discouraged. While such a
                            proposal might be desirable in future depending on developments, we
                            believe there is no need for additional <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> instrumentality at this time <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483"
                                facs="0513"/>other than <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group
                            under <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> operating on basis of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolutions. As long as developments on
                            ground are progressing reasonably satisfactorily on basis of present
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> instrumentality, there is no need
                            to inject good offices committee which inevitably would seek to find
                            some mid-point compromise between <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>,
                            and Tshombe. This would tend strengthen <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> rather than advance our objective of increasing
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control and consolidating
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s position. We
                            strongly prefer guidance for next steps on Congo question to remain in
                            hands of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> exclusively, rather than
                            resort to three or four member group which would treat the respective
                            parties on basis of equality. We urge therefore you actively discourage
                            this idea.</p>
                        <p>In addition foregoing substantive considerations, timing of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting also important. If <persName

                            struggle, then it might be advantageous delay next <gloss

                            statement which the Secretary had made to him that the Secretary-General
                            could call on the five permanent members of the Security Council for
                            assistance if he so desired. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> said that the French assume this would not be
                            done unless the Soviets had given unilateral assistance. He <pb n="484"
                                xml:id="pg_484" facs="0514"/>wondered if the Soviets continued their
                            unilateral penetration of the Congo, whether the U.S. would feel free to
                            act. He said it appeared that Soviet intervention was becoming more and
                            more open.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we had not
                            yet reached this point and that for the present we were giving fullest
                            possible support to the Secretary-General. We were disturbed that
                            Hammarskjold appeared to be losing some African support. We thought that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> might withdraw its forces from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command and according to ticker
                            reports, Ghana might also take this step. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> noted that the Africans in
                            general had heretofore been reasonable and that the French were
                            concerned that they now appeared to be changing their position. He
                            thought the chaos existing in the Congo presented Hammarskjold with a
                            most intricate problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that it was our
                            view that if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should
                            disappear, all of the other Congolese leaders including Tshombe would be
                            willing to enter into negotiations and re-write the Congolese
                            constitution. If <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should
                            disappear the Force Publique could be retrained in some months into an
                            effective national army. However, everything appeared hopeless so long
                            as <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was on the scene.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that the
                            French felt it was important to keep in close touch with us on this
                            subject, especially since the Soviet actions were becoming more and more
                            overt, and we might want to act together in the Congo.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command is making an effort to
                            establish the authority of Congo’s President <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and set the stage for an early attempt to
                            remove <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> from power. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> apparently arranged the surrender
                            of arms on September 10th by the bulk of the 3000 Congolese <pb n="485"
                                xml:id="pg_485" facs="0515"/>troops stationed in Leopoldville. In
                            addition, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> provided the troops
                            their first pay in two months, and announced an order attributed to the
                            Congolese army for a cease-fire throughout the Congo. The cease-fire
                            order has been cautiously welcomed by Tshombe but has been denounced by
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. The <gloss

                            border.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold received a cable from <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> on Saturday<note n="1" xml:id="d212fn1"
                                >September 10.</note> announcing the appointment of a new government
                            headed by Ileo. On learning of this cable, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> changed its tactics and demanded continuing
                            substantive discussion rather than suspension. Wadsworth told
                            Hammarskjold that we continue to stand behind them in supporting
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s efforts to oust
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Hammarskjold
                            commented he still believes we can break <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. Hammarskjold has called for $100 million in
                            economic aid for the Congo and the State Department feels that an
                            announcement of our willingness to contribute up to $40 million would
                            have a substantial impact at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, in
                            the Congo, and throughout Africa. The Russians intend to demand (1)
                            release of airfields and radio to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, (2) freedom of action to <persName

                        <p>Finally, yesterday, on our motion, the Security Council voted 9 to 2 to
                            adjourn and reconvene when the Council President considers it advisable.
                            This was done because the Council felt it to be heading in no clear
                            direction and all proposals seemed disadvantageous to <persName

                            focus on Soviet activities outside the Council framework. Wadsworth has
                            been instructed to take the line publicly that <persName

                            and that the outside world looks to the head for authoritative
                            information as to the identity of his government.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the army arrested <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> for three hours yesterday, and on his release,
                            he proceeded to the radio station in a loud speaker car, attempting
                            without success to rally the population on the way. At the station a
                            Ghana major in charge refused to allow him to use it. Following this,
                            there is a report that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            planned to seize the airport to execute an escape to Stanleyville. Also,
                            he is reportedly trying to rally soldiers to his side without indication
                            of success up to this moment.</p>

                        <p>Cairo has indicated support for <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> by announcing withdrawal of its force of 515 men
                            on the basis that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had violated
                            Congo sovereignty. Harriman has been visiting the Congo and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has assured Harriman and

                            to stick to his guns in removing <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                            agreed that his forces were afraid during Thursday’s vote. He also
                            agreed that the Force Publique and the police should be disarmed and
                            courts set up. Harriman’s talks with Congolese leaders convince him that
                            we can expect little if anything to be done in parliamentary form
                            against <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>

                                western position single-handed much longer.” Harriman replied that
                                the United States was “obliged work thru <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> and unable use same underhanded tactics as Soviets.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> will continue to cause
                            difficulties in the Congo whether he is in control of the government, in
                            jail or released. He is a rabblerousing speaker, a shrewd maneuverer
                            with clever left-wing advisers, aided and encouraged by Soviet and Czech
                            Ambassadors. He is obsessed with his mission to unify the Congo,
                            believes he is the only man who speaks for 80 percent of the Congolese
                            people. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not do his
                            bidding, he considers it a new form of colonialism. He thinks if he can
                            get his troops into Katanga and the Belgians removed that the people
                            will give him their support. He is confident he can be successful in a
                            civil war if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> keeps hands off. He is of
                            course counting on full support from Soviets.</p>

                        <p>I feel our best hope is strongest support by Security Council for
                            continued backing of Hammarskjold and <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName>, and insistence Russians and Belgians or others
                            desist from giving aid outside <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It is
                            of utmost importance that African opinion be exerted. Although <persName

                            difficult, British pressure may bring him into line again. Nigeria when
                            independent will loyally support every effort to prevent Russian
                            influence in Congo. Except for Sekou Toure and perhaps Sudanese, former
                            French African leaders can be counted on to oppose Communist designs in
                            Congo. Bourguiba influence is considerable among West Africans.</p>
                        <p>In Leopoldville members in Parliament will be afraid to vote against

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can get control of Force Publique.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> knows how to use even
                            a few squads of soldiers to terrorize those who oppose him.</p>
                        <p>If Russians fail to agree to channel their aid through <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, other means must be adopted to stop it.
                            In this, support of other new African states would be important.</p>
                        <p>It is conceivable that if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            is confronted with no aid from Soviets and firm stand by other West
                            African leaders, he might temporarily change his position.</p>
                        <p>Kanza told me some deputies were urging on <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> that he request <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>Situation today has been aggravated by early weakness in United Nations
                            action. Best hope today is in firmness, particularly against Soviet

                        <p>On September 14, the U.N. Security Council met three times to discuss the
                            situation in the Congo. The first two sessions were occupied with the
                            problem of the two rival Congolese delegations. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJJ2">James J. Wadsworth</persName> argued that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s
                            representative, <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Justin Bomboko</persName>,
                            was the proper Congolese representative but that a debate on the subject
                            would not be useful. He proposed that for the time being, neither
                            delegation should be invited. Subsequently, the Polish Representative
                            moved to invite Thomas Kanza; the motion was defeated by a vote of 3 to
                            0, with 8 abstentions, including the United States. At the evening
                            session, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Valerian A. Zorin made a lengthy
                            and highly critical statement on U.N. actions in the Congo and
                            Secretary-General Hammarskjold replied briefly. For the record of the

                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said it would not be easy to brief the
                            Council on the situation in the Congo. The President, interrupting, said
                            he understood a third force had appeared in the Congo. Mr.

                            force had developed there. [Congolese Army Chief of Staff Colonel

                            had proposed that the Congo should be governed until December 31, 1960
                            by a “collectivity” of students and technicians. He had announced a
                            policy of cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, had
                            asked that Soviet and Czech technicians leave the country within
                            forty-eight hours, and had demanded that the embassies of the Communist
                            countries be placed under guard. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            reported that Communist technicians had not left the Congo nor had the
                            Communist embassies been placed under guard. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> added that the <persName

                                >Mobutu</persName> team had moved with the speed of a snail
                            according to reports of U.S. representatives in the Congo. The situation
                                <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0520"/>could only be characterized
                            as fantastic, a situation in which no one seems able to take any action
                            with the exception of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and
                            his actions indicate that he is insane. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            believed that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> probably
                            leaned a little more toward <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> than toward <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> since he (<persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>) had been appointed by Ileo. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said he would not go into detail on
                            events transpiring in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He would
                            say, however, that the brutal Soviet attack on Secretary General
                            Hammarskjold deeply engaged the future of the latter as well as the
                            prestige of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> then noted [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of

                            Soviet ship is also en route to the Congo. Moreover, the Sudan recently
                            received a request to permit the “Soviet-Congo Air Services” to overfly
                            the Sudan. However, the Soviet planes, which had landed in the <gloss

                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said the latest news from the Congo was
                            that Mobutu had been arrested and then released, which seemed to be
                            standard practice, and that Ileo would hold a cabinet meeting today with
                            Mobutu present. He asked whether Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> wished to add anything on the Congo.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said the Western
                            Powers were taking the offensive at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> by tabling a resolution supported by the Secretary
                            General and by Tunisia. A Soviet veto of this resolution was
                            anticipated, however. If the Soviets did exercise the veto in this case,
                            they will show themselves to be anti-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            In the event of a Soviet veto, the Congo case will probably be referred

                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> had announced in a radio
                            address the previous evening that the Army had decided to “neutralize”
                            the chief of state, the two rival governments, and the legislature until
                            December 31, during which time the politicians could try to reach an
                            accord. He declared that this was not a military coup but a “peaceful
                            revolution” and that the Army would call on Congolese and foreign
                            technicians to save the country from chaos. At a press conference later
                            that evening, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> declared

                        <p>At the first of two U.N. Security Council meetings on September 15,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJJ2">Wadsworth</persName> introduced a

                            and order and in particular to refrain from sending military personnel,
                            supplies, or equipment into the Congo other than through the United
                            Nations and reaffirmed that the U.N. force should “continue to act to
                            restore and maintain law and order as necessary for the maintenance of
                            international peace and <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0521"

                        <p>736. Events of yesterday and today give me some hope that act one of the
                            Congo drama has ended. The prologue ended with the arrival of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops and the withdrawal of Belgian
                            troops to their bases.</p>
                        <p>Act two will be concerned with the slow and difficult process of
                            establishing some sort of government that will begin to function, an
                            effort to assess the economic damage already done and first steps to
                            arrest further deterioration.</p>
                        <p>While the Russians will volley and thunder with redoubled vigor if their
                            Embassys are, as we expect, evicted tomorrow, they will find it much
                            more difficult to peddle their poison in the Congo and even harder to
                            influence government and people here. The trained seals are running for
                            cover and even local clerks who worked for Lumumbavitch are being
                            methodically arrested.</p>
                        <p>I feel even more important a result will be the impact on world opinion
                            of the fact that this new and troubled African country has given the

                        <p>On September 16, the U.N. Security Council met three times to discuss the
                            situation in the Congo, with Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea,
                            Liberia, Morocco, and the United Arab Republic participating at the
                            Council’s invitation. At the session that evening, Ceylonese
                            Representative Sir Claude Corea and Tunisian Representative <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM8">Mongi Slim</persName> introduced a draft resolution
                            reaffirming that the U.N. force should “continue to act to restore and
                            maintain law and order as necessary for the maintenance of international
                            peace and security”, reaffirming the Council’s request to all states to
                            refrain from actions that might tend to impede the restoration of law
                            and order or that might undermine the Congo’s territorial integrity and
                            political independence, declaring that no military assistance should be
                            sent to the Congo except through the United Nations, and calling upon
                            all states to assist in carrying out the Council’s decisions. (U.N. doc.
                            S/4523)</p>
                        <p>Soviet Representative Valerian A. Zorin proposed five amendments (U.N.
                            doc. S/4524) to this resolution, which Corea and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> rejected. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WJJ2">James J. Wadsworth</persName> yielded priority to
                            the Ceylonese-Tunisian resolution, but Zorin insisted that the Council
                            vote on a Soviet draft resolution which he had introduced the previous
                            day, calling on the Secretary-General and the U.N. Command in the Congo
                            to “cease forthwith” any interference in the Congo’s internal affairs
                            and to withdraw U.N. troops from all airports and radio stations in the
                            Congo. (U.N. doc. S/4519) It was voted down by 7 votes to 2, with Ceylon
                            and Tunisia abstaining, after which the Soviet amendments were rejected
                            in separate voice votes. The vote on the Ceylonese-Tunisian resolution
                            was 8 to 2 (the Soviet Union and Poland) with 1 abstention (France). The
                            resolution was thus vetoed by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJJ2">Wadsworth</persName> did not press
                            for a vote on the U.S. draft resolution but proposed a new draft
                            resolution (U.N. doc. S/4525) calling for an emergency special session
                            of the U.N. General Assembly. This procedural resolution was adopted
                            over Zorin’s objection by a vote of 8 to 2, with 1 abstention. For the

                        <p>424. Re: Special <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Congo Session.
                            Following are Dept suggestions which you requested use as guidance re
                            emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on Congo:</p>
                        <p>1) We consider focus of session should be maximum possible extent be one
                            of highlighting Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> confrontation
                            in particular obdurate Soviet insistence on pursuing unilateral course
                            in Congo and in undermining <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> action contrary to overwhelming
                            sentiment <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members, including most
                            Afro-Asians. Statement being prepared for <persName corresp="#p_WJJ2"
                                >Wadsworth</persName> will stress this theme.</p>
                        <p>2) At same time we recognize US must help give lead and direction to
                            debate to encourage more timid to stand up and be counted, and that you
                            must balance this need against main objective of having session
                                Soviet-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> contest rather than
                            Soviet-US contest.</p>
                        <p>3) Strongly preferable, therefore, in our view that <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> or Slim give lead off in <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and you should encourage them to do so.
                            It would be logical for either of them to speak first or one follow
                            other, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> because of his heavy
                            involvement and importance he attaches to having his mandate supported,
                            and Slim because of his sponsorship of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            resolution. (Ceylon less desirable because of ambivalent position.)</p>
                        <p>4) If neither is willing to open debate, nor some other moderate African
                            (such as Ethiopia), you authorized speak first, as sponsor of <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res requesting special session if you
                            believe this desirable in order channel debate into constructive
                            channel.</p>
                        <p>5) Re res, we understand consideration being given by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> to introduction same res Soviet
                            vetoed in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> with appropriate technical
                            modifications. This strikes us as sound course, but you should make
                            clear US unwilling accept any weakening essential ingredients, i.e.
                            confirming and strengthening mandate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, and focusing on activities
                            designed undermine <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> efforts.</p>
                        <p>6) You should consult urgently with all friendly dels encouraging them to
                            give full presentation their views, expressing hope they will be
                            unequivocal in support <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Congo operation
                            and in opposition Soviet intervention. More and longer speeches from
                            friendly dels better, since there is advantage from our point of view to

                        <p>746. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> last night asked
                            Embassy if US could transport his delegation to New York. It was
                            suggested that since there are already two delegations there it would be
                            better combine them with <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>
                            as head and Kanza as deputy. He seemed to buy idea and promised send
                            telegram. Embassy now endeavoring get <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> obviously frightened
                            possibility of assassination. This morning he nipped an attempt on his
                            life by a major who had been put up to it by Mpolo and <persName

                            People, children, dogs come and go in steady stream. He doesn’t even
                            have a secretary and still talks naively about his “council of students”
                            running government. He feels that this will be a device to bridge
                            transfer his coup to an Ileo-<persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> government by end October but said he logically
                            cannot support Ileo immediately. He seems be completely honest,
                            dedicated and appalled by enormity of problems facing him. General
                            Kettani and Moroccan officers appear be principal advisers.</p>

                            reportedly hiding out somewhere under Ghanaian protection, is
                            characteristically active, issuing press releases which turn up
                            mysteriously on bars of three major hotels. He complains that <gloss

                            order”. It is clear that if he can’t get rid of Mobutu in next few days
                            he will make effort get Stanleyville and operate from there. Mobutu
                            aware this and determined to prevent.</p>

                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> believed it was clear that the
                            Soviets had not given up in the Congo. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            reported that the Soviet diplomats left the Congo so hurriedly that the
                            Soviet markings which they painted over the Congo markings on their
                            planes were still wet when they left. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            said the Soviet ships off the African coast were apparently awaiting a
                            clarification of the situation. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> appeared to be the effective power in the Congo
                            for the moment but <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was not
                            yet disposed of and remained a grave danger as long as he was not

                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar asked what the latest news was from the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> appeared to be in
                            control and that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was still
                            in Leopoldville. We thought it was better for <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> to stay in Leopoldville, for, if he goes to
                            Stanleyville, there is a danger of another Katanga type development. We
                            consider <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> to be the legal
                            head of the Congo Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar said we should be careful not to back <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> too openly, for there is a
                            danger that he would be tarred with the Western brush.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar then asked about the French abstention on the Congo
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lucet said that the French had abstained on the Congo issue from the
                            beginning, feeling that the question was not proper in the context
                            utilized. The French felt that the goal of the United Nations was to
                            expel white influence from Africa. The French were also never ready to
                            vote for the immediate withdrawal of the Belgians from that area. <pb
                                n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0529"/>Admitting that there had been
                            lots of bilateral consultations with the British and Americans, he said
                            the French felt strongly it was not useful to expel the Belgians from
                            the Congo nor to contribute to an anti-white movement. Actually, the
                            French were extremely pleased with the result of the latest vote, but he
                            pointed to the ambiguity in the resolution.</p>
                        <p>He said the French abstained because they didn’t know quite where we were
                            all going and besides they had abstained in the past.</p>
                        <p>The French have a definite feeling that the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> has been consistently anti-European and anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_WGTD1">white</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar said that everyone admitted the whole Congo development
                            was messy, but how could the West extricate itself except by going
                            through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said the United
                            States felt it had no alternative but completely to back Hammarskjold.
                            Otherwise there was a danger that all Western influence would disappear
                            in the area. He said he didn’t want to labor the point and, observing
                            that Hammarskjold in walking the tight rope had done some things we
                            didn’t like, said we strongly differed from the French view and felt
                            there was no question of Hammarskjold trying to have the white Western
                            elements evicted from Africa. Mr. Hoyer Millar noted that it would have
                            been completely dangerous to have used in this sense troops from members
                            on the Security Council because the Russians obviously would have been
                            first in line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said he knew that
                            Hammarskjold has as a continuing long-term goal the utilization of white
                            Western technicians, preferably Belgians, in the Congo. He observed that
                            we were frankly acutely distressed to see in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> the French vote on the side of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar said the British also were puzzled on why we differed on
                            this problem. Obviously tripartite action on our part would have brought
                            the Soviets into the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> added that this also
                            would have turned all of the Africans against us. We felt there should
                            be no doubt of our strong and continuing support of Hammarskjold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lucet said that the treatment of the Belgian troops had been brutal.
                            He wondered about channeling economic aid through the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, observing that the French object to
                            this. The French feel the best thing is to have the Belgian technicians
                            return to the Congo, and with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolution currently in force, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            can’t ask the Belgians to come back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar said that, if the Congolese were to ask for the return
                            of Belgian technicians, obviously there could be no <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objection.</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that we have
                            never believed that Hammarskjold intended to impede the return of
                            Belgian technicians to the Congo. In our strong support of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we have always separated the issue of
                            short-term rehabilitation, which we feel should be channeled through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, from the long-term problem of
                            development capital, which we think should come from individual
                            sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lucet asked about Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> said obviously
                            we didn’t want the natural resources of Katanga lost to the West.
                            Unfortunately, Katanga as a political issue represents to the African
                            states the whole “capitalist-colonial” dichotomy. He said we would
                            prefer to see a Congo federation, including Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoyer Millar said the British would agree with the federation
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lucet said so much depends on <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was certainly not yet out of the picture.</p>

                        <p>On September 22, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> addressed the U.N. General Assembly. His
                            comments concerning the Congo read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In response to the call of the Republic of the Congo, the United
                            Nations, under its outstanding Secretary General, has recently mounted a
                            large-scale effort to provide that new Republic with help. That effort
                            has been flagrantly attacked by a few nations which wish to prolong
                            strife in the Congo for their own purposes. The criticism directed by
                            these nations against the Secretary-General, who has honourably and
                            effectively fulfilled the mandate which he received from the United
                            Nations, is nothing less than a direct attack upon the United Nations
                            itself. In my opinion the Secretary-General has earned the support and
                            the gratitude of every peace-loving nation.</p>
                        <p>“The people of the Congo are entitled to build up their country in peace
                            and freedom. Intervention by other nations in their internal affairs
                            would deny them that right and create a focus of conflict in the heart
                            of Africa. The issue thus posed in the Congo could well arise elsewhere
                            in Africa. The resolution of this issue will determine whether the

                        <p>783. Evidence has steadily accumulated that Ghana, Guinea and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have been putting continuous and
                            mounting pressures on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            Ileo to reach a compromise with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. Their maximum goal is reestablishment of status
                            quo ante dismissal <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>;
                            failing that, at least his inclusion as one of ministers. I believe this
                            move is sparkplugged by <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            who clings to dream of Ghana–Guinea–Congo union as stepping stone to
                            Nkrumization of Africa. If <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            is out of Congo, so is that part of dream.</p>
                        <p>In fact, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has amply
                            demonstrated that all his instincts are destructive; he is master of
                            attack but knows and cares nothing for pacification or construction.
                            During his short reign terror and civil war were the order of the day.
                            He would be a serious threat to peace and reconstruction out of the
                            government; in it he would be or soon put himself in position to be, as
                            disruptive as he has been.</p>
                        <p>I can think of no greater disservice to the realization of the
                            aspirations of the Congolese people and to our own for them than to
                            stand aside and let these three countries have the field to themselves
                            in such pressure play. Believe our Embassies these countries should make
                            plain our view that they should take the heat off, basing ourselves on
                            non-interference, and adding that we feel <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is bad medicine.</p>

                        <p>Mission should also discuss foregoing informally with Africans, including

                            If we had not done so on Cameroun, there is strong possibility it would

                        <p>I told them that I would try to talk to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> today in order obtain his support for <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s position.</p>
                        <p>During conversation which lasted approximately one hour I made following
                            other points:</p>
                        <p>1. My government fully realizes that certain powers such as Guinea,
                            Ghana, <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Morocco and Tunis have been
                            and still are bringing pressure to bear on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and other Congolese leaders in order to effect
                            a reconciliation between <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. I stated this
                            question of pressure was being taken up by US with <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and respective delegations at <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in New York which include several heads
                            of state. I declared in my opinion it would not be profitable to come to
                            an understanding with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.
                            During the two months he was in power, he created anarchy throughout
                            country, he fought with his collaborators, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, he helped bring
                            cold war to Congo by accepting direct assistance military nature from
                            Soviets, he fanned fires of civil war in country and in summary
                            constituted a centrifugal rather than centripetal force. I added he was
                            an evil influence who would be bad for the Congo. It was for these
                            reasons that I was squarely against him. Added we had worked with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> while he was
                            recognized Prime Minister and we prepared work with legal successor.</p>
                        <p>I stated my government considered <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> to be legal head of Congo state and that it
                            supported him strongly.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and Ileo agreed with
                            above remarks and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> stated
                            he had no intentions whatsoever of effecting reconciliation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, knowing it would not
                            be in interest peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>I stated that no power, whether great or small had right to inject itself
                            in internal affairs of Congo and this is US policy.</p>
                        <p>Since army mutiny in early July, disorder and subversion have been
                            reigning in Congolese army rank, principally because its cadre of
                            officers has disappeared. I stated that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> may wish ask <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            establish pool of army officers drawn from various countries who could
                            be seconded to Congo to run and train national Congolese army. In order
                            regain control army and to blunt efforts certain politicians to convert
                            parts or all of it into political weapon, it was essential that a cadre
                            of officers, directly responsible to Chief of State, as CINC, be created
                            as quickly as possible. I pointed out that as soon as Congolese officers
                            were formed they could replace the “temporary ones.” Pointed out plenty
                            of precedent in British officers with Ghana troops and with Indian
                            troops after independence. Those, however, were bilateral while this
                            should go through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> although requiring
                            also agreement with countries asked to second officers.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>3. I enquired why <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been
                            permitted remain in official residence of Prime Minister since his
                            dismissal. I stated this constituted psychological advantage for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and that Ileo in his
                            capacity as Prime Minister should be living there now.</p>
                        <p>They agreed this was case but seemed to think this could be solved only
                            by arresting him. I suggested they consider, whether or not they willing
                            or able arrest him, telling <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> they
                            insist <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> be removed from
                            official Prime Minister office and residence so that legal Prime
                            Minister Ileo could move in. They may have accepted this idea but went
                            back to problem of arrest.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> declared that warrant for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s arrest which had
                            been made out be Attorney General on September 8 was still valid, but
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> had shown some
                            hesitancy about arresting former Prime Minister. He stated there was
                            another army officer who was willing to arrest <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. I suggested that before serving
                            warrant <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> should inform
                            Dayal to satisfy him warrant legal and ask for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> army officer to accompany arresting party in order
                            inform <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> soldiers guarding <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> that party had legal warrant for
                            arrest of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. I stated that
                            if these procedures were followed, I believed <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> forces should encounter no obstruction from
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in arresting Lumumbu.</p>
                        <p>4. With reference to ambiguity that exists between legal positions
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, Ileo and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>’s Council of High
                            Commissioners, I asked them if they approved action of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. They replied they approved
                            and supported him and prepared reiterate. I pointed out confusion among
                            many nations at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> meeting yet to be
                            ironed out.</p>
                        <p>5. I informed <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and Ileo
                            that my staff and I were at their entire disposal. I added that I had
                            not come out to see them as frequently as I would have liked, but that I
                            did not wish give impression to their opponents that we were working too
                            closely with them. They fully understand and agree.</p>
                        <p>6. In thanking me for my visit and advice, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and Ileo appeared to be sincerely appreciative
                            of the position we have taken. They also seemed to be eager to follow
                            our recommendations. I believe my visit came at most opportune moment,
                            in that it will show <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            Ileo, who have been subjected to various pressures, that they are not
                            alone in their anti-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            struggle. They indicated they would call <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> immediately to inform him of US views, to
                            encourage him and induce him take necessary action his part.</p>
                        <p>On return to office I received disturbing reports, not yet fully
                            confirmed, that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> may be
                            yielding to pressure (probably from Kettani whom he likes and trusts)
                            and may already have made overtures to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> assuming latter will soon be back in saddle. We
                            are endeavoring directly stiffen <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s backbone and hope <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and Ileo will also be successful today that
                            same enterprise.</p>

                                he had given for the chief U.N. delegates of the newly-admitted

                        <p>I called on the Secretary General alone at my request. I began by giving
                            him the substance of the information contained in the attached talking
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>When I finished, Hammarskjold said that he found it most difficult to
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> might not share
                            his views on the danger of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>. He went on to say that he is in contact with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> by telephone once or
                            twice a day and he has always found <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> in complete agreement with his views, and ready to
                            carry out his instructions wholeheartedly. With respect to the arrest of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, Hammarskjold said
                            that he had given orders that the U.N. troops should not interfere in
                            any way with the service of a warrant or the actual arrest of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Hammarskjold went on to say
                            that the difficulty is that while various people may have in their

                            arrest, they have so far been unwilling to put them into effect because
                            of fear of popular reaction to such a step. In addition, he <pb n="507"
                                xml:id="pg_507" facs="0537"/>went on to say that there is only one
                            appointed judge in the whole of the Congo before whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> could be brought for trial in
                            the event of his arrest.</p>
                        <p>As to activities of Ghanaian and Guinean troops, the Secretary General
                            said that they have an order to prevent <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> from leaving Leopoldville and that so far they
                            have carried out this order. I asked the Secretary General about the
                            report we had received during the afternoon to the effect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been travelling around the
                            city of Leopoldville in a jeep accompanied by Ghanaian troops with U.N.
                            helmets. Hammarskjold confirmed the report but said that he had
                            instructed General von Horn to call in the commander of the Ghanaian
                            troops and demand that the officers responsible for this action be
                            disciplined. Von Horn had also under instructions warned the Ghanaian
                            commander that any further breaches of U.N. discipline of this sort
                            would be dealt with more severely. The Secretary General concluded by
                            reiterating his complete confidence in <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName>.</p>

                            by Ambs <persName corresp="#p_SBL1">Scheyven</persName> and Loridan) had
                            discussion with Secretary September 26.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said regretted there had been differences between US and
                            Belgium and wished talk them over as friends. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said also distressed over differences. Must now
                            discuss what can be done at present. Chief problem has been and is
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, a “fool” and totally
                            unreasonable. But everything not lost; immediate future will be
                            important. US action can be decisive. Has not been understood in
                            Belgium, where public opinion felt nation had not had support from US
                            due friend in distress.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> analyzed Congo situation as
                            follows: Must have reasonable people on “other side of table”,
                            mentioning <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, Ileo,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and Western powers must be firm in support those who
                            are against <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Re Katanga,
                            Belgian policy in past had favored unity of independent Congo; however,
                            with coming of anarchy was important save at least one part of country.
                            Katanga must remain free until new Congo can be built up. If Katanga
                            gives way while <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> remains,
                            this end for entire Congo. Again stressed Belgium against destruction
                            Congo unity or separate Katanga state. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said officers of Katanga forces are on leave from
                            Belgian Army and are lent to Force Publique. Do not receive orders from
                            Belgium. If they were to leave situation would be serious.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said Congo must have strong
                            executive, so as rebuild administrative structure, maintain social and
                            economic achievements, protect private enterprise, and put an end to
                            physical and legal insecurity.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he agreed with this analysis. US had made clear only legal
                            Congo govt is that of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>. We
                            believe <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> very dangerous and
                            must be got out of govt. Thus clear whom we support, <pb n="509"
                                xml:id="pg_509" facs="0539"/>and we have supplied Hammarskjold with
                            $5 million for assistance. We deeply concerned over attitude Ghana,
                            Guinea and <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and actions their troops
                            in Congo. May have offer resolution in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in Congo that do not
                            remain under strict <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command must be
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Turning to other matters, <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>
                            said Belgium must maintain support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> but it faced with difficulties (financial and
                            political) in maintaining defense contribution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he hoped Belgium would maintain contribution and referred
                            to danger of others following suit if Belgium cuts.</p>

                            along tribal lines. Apparently twelve tribes are involved and no tribe
                            will be represented unless it has at least 500,000 members. <persName

                            during latter’s informal evening call at my home, I made points raised
                            in reference telegrams.</p>
                        <p>1. I outlined in detail reasons why Tshombe should publicize his
                            willingness to talk with other moderate leaders of former Belgian Congo
                            concerning future constitutional arrangements and stressed impact which
                            this would undoubtedly have on leaders of independent African states.
                            Tshombe replied that it was his idea to convoke conference of moderate
                            leaders in first place. I suggested he follow through by supporting
                            plans of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, Ileo, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> for holding this
                            conference at Leopoldville in near future, adding strong implication
                            that Department hoped that these persons would benefit from a general
                            rallying of moderate Congolese leaders to their support. Tshombe replied
                            without conviction that although he still favors conference idea, he
                            generally discouraged by inability other moderate leaders to fight for
                            their principles and is therefore unwilling attend meeting in
                            Leopoldville where even his personal safety cannot be assured during
                            present chaotic period. I asked Tshombe to think over my suggestion and
                            proposed we discuss it again this coming weekend. He indicated in reply
                            there was little likelihood that he would change his mind until
                            Leopoldville situation became clarified; although he himself might
                            decide to convoke conference moderate leaders in Elisabethville.</p>
                        <p>2. Pursuing theme that Tshombe should campaign to win support among
                            independent African States, I broached subject of possible visits by him
                            to African capitals, beginning with those where he most likely to
                            receive encouraging welcome. I indicated such visits might be <pb
                                n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0543"/>of greater benefit to Katanga
                            than sending Katangan “Foreign Minister” Evariste Kimba to New York and
                            Washington (reported separately). Tshombe listened carefully but made no
                            comment on this subject.</p>
                        <p>3. Commenting on important role of independent African states in
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action in Congo, I proposed
                            that Tshombe give maximum publicity to his willingness to share
                            responsibility with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for maintaining
                            order in central Baluba area. I said that past unfortunate outbursts by
                            Katangan officials against <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions in
                            Katanga may have had effect of painting Katanga Government as hostile to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Congo operations which have
                            received overwhelming support of non-Communist world. I equated
                            Katanga’s acceptance of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> assistance and
                            cooperation with improved image Katanga might make in eyes of African
                            states as well as other free world nations. Tshombe offered no comment
                            concerning his present relations with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            (although I understand from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> source
                            these relations are presently much better).</p>
                        <p>4. Finally I broached subject of minimizing more visible aspects Belgian
                            influence Katanga. I made clear this criticism meant in constructive way
                            and was not attempted to discredit Belgian assistance to Katanga or
                            obliquely to achieve removal Belgian technicians from province. I
                            indicated my willingness to make these observations to Ambassador
                            Rothschild as proof my constructive intentions. I nevertheless stressed
                            that too obvious Belgian presence in support Katanga Government has led
                            to criticism abroad and in Katanga that Tshombe government is
                            neocolonial regime. Tshombe said answer to this was simple: He and his
                            entire family were anti-Belgian. He outlined at length his deep-rooted
                            antagonism toward Belgium, but added that his present choice lay between
                            accepting only western help offered him or depriving Katangan population
                            of badly needed technical services. Tshombe added with thinly disguised
                            bitterness that he would like nothing better than to internationalize
                            corps of technicians upon which his government depends. I repeated that
                            my criticism was directed toward too obvious manifestations of Belgian
                            presence and not towards principle of European advisers who are employed
                            by almost all independent African regimes. I again referred to image of
                            Katanga held by independent African states and voiced my personal
                            conviction that Katangan regime has substance as well as support of
                            African population.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is possible that certain ideas
                            discussed in this conversation will take root in Tshombe’s thinking and
                            cause him to react in desired direction. However, particularly on
                            subject joining rally of moderate Congo leaders behind <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and others in Leopoldville, he
                            showed apparent determination to back away from Leopoldville situation
                            and to move further on separatist limb along which he has progressed
                            rather rapidly in recent weeks.</p>
                        <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>Most striking aspect of conversation was Tshombe’s unwillingness express
                            interest or concern over non-acceptance by independent African states of
                            Katanga’s claim to being representative African state. This blind spot
                            called to mind my recent conversation with Interior Minister Munongo
                            who, when reminded that African states were watching Katanga closely,
                            called down plague on all their houses. In course conversation, I
                            mentioned possibility of visit to Elisabethville by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName>. Tshombe said he had no
                            objection to such visit for, “although the US and Katanga do not agree
                            on anything relating to Katanga, we are nevertheless still friends”.
                            This hardly constituted cordial invitation and I believe Ambassador will
                            agree situation here should develop further before date for visit is
                            set.</p>
                        <p>Toward end of conversation I suggested we discuss these subjects again
                            and indicated my willingness to review points with other leaders in
                            Tshombe’s cabinet. Tshombe indicated meeting might be arranged with Vice
                            President Jean Kibwe, who he said takes moderate view these matters, but
                            he ruled out meeting with Munongo whom he described as very
                            emotional.</p>
                        <p>In summing up his ideas before his departure, Tshombe said that US failed
                            to appreciate hard facts of African politics. He said Africans
                            appreciate only two things: Force and money. If US really wanted help
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and Ileo it should
                            give them sufficient money to buy support of few key politicians and
                            legislators in Leopoldville. This is what he himself has tried to do.
                            Tshombe said Soviet bloc recognizes these facts and acts accordingly.
                            However US cannot even recognize its own anti-Communist allies in
                            Africa. This is due, he thought, to fact US makes mistake of playing
                            game honestly and fairly, as result of which US will never succeed in
                            its political bargaining with independent African states.</p>

                        <p>After welcoming the President back to the United States, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> emphasized our full
                            support of the United Nations in the Congo since we saw no alternative
                            between the United Nations and chaos. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had been received in Washington by the United
                            States Government and we had flown his delegation to the United Nations.
                            Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> seemed
                            determined to curtail the United Nations role in the Congo and
                            facilitate that of the Soviet Union. The United States believed that the
                            African countries also were opposed to the spread of the cold war to
                            Africa and, therefore, approved our operating through the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>President Toure observed that it was not any individual Congolese who was
                            important but the independence and unity of the country. He insisted
                            that the “legality” of the Congo, as established through free elections,
                            must be respected. Although Belgian paratroopers have committed
                            aggression in the Congo, the United Nations declares it should be
                            neutral with respect to both the aggressors and those attacked; Guinea
                            does not agree with this reasoning. In intervening in the Congo the
                            United Nations has ignored the local government which invited them in in
                            the first place. Why should this be the case in the Congo but not the
                            case during the Suez crisis where the United Nations cooperated with the
                            Nasser Government?</p>

                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> tried to
                            point out that the two cases were not identical, the President referred
                            very emotionally to the extreme poverty of his country, its leaders and
                            the members of his own family. Even though we are a poor country no one
                            can challenge the “legitimacy” of the Guinean (and, by inference, the
                            Congolese) Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> stressed the
                            vital importance of the United Nations especially for the smaller
                            countries. The President agreed and remarked that although he might seem
                            to be harsh in his attacks on the Secretary General, Guinea was second
                            to none in its support of the United Nations.</p>

                            are now at Accra and Conakry. A Soviet freighter, believed to be

                            still off the African coast. The financial situation in the Congo is

                            concluded his briefing on the Congo by reporting that the <gloss

                        <p>“Mr. McCone reported that while in Europe recently he had heard that the

                        <p>949. Saw <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> four p.m. yesterday
                            to review present situation. Said understood warrant for arrest
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been issued but
                            that service had not been permitted. Asked whether previously understood
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> policy that legitimate warrant
                            arrest would be honored still obtained, pointing out <persName

                            assured me in past such was case. <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> said no change in policy. I said I understood
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> had seen him 1300
                            yesterday but the warrant of arrest, which he presented, was disputed
                            and I wished to know <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>’s
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Latter said he had not seen warrant but had referred it to legal section
                                <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> which informed him warrant not
                            valid. I said understood warrant signed by Attorney General who was so
                            far as I knew, competent authority. <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> said his understanding was warrant signed by
                            Commissaire [and] <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> considered it
                            invalid.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> said he felt arrest of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was not proper
                            solution but “trick” and believed this was bad answer to present problem
                            Congo. Said recent debate <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> had won
                            by narrow margin through support Afro-Asian group and that arrest
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> now would explode
                            issue again in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Believed
                            Afro-Asian group would object such solution and would at least be badly
                            split. He believed eventual solution Congo depended on united support
                            Afro-Asian group and asked me exercise influence with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> desist from effort arrest
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in interest of
                            obtaining “peaceful” solution. I asked him whether this in support
                            reconciliation. <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> said he
                            hoped democratic solution could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>I said experience those here during first days indicated <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was unstable, had incited
                            disorder, and had no solution to Congo problem short of domination as
                            illustrated by attacks on Katanga and Kasai. I said return <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to government would exacerbate
                            divisive elements in Congo and that attitude Tshombe, Kalonji and other
                            regional leaders was clear and unalterably opposed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Added that <gloss
                                target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> problems would be multiplied if
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> returns since he quite
                            capable of reasserting leadership even though admitted to new government

                                corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> made following exposé: He
                            personally has nothing against <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. However <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> has demonstrated that he is dangerous to peace
                            in Congo. <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> had documentary
                            proof distribution weapons and money (twelve distributors were caught

                                >Bomboko</persName> said had evidence <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                            <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> made impassioned argument
                            that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would tear Congo
                            apart, which he had almost succeeded in doing and regional leaders
                            unalterably opposed to him, but that he and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>, together with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>, were trying to hold Congo together. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> returned, even they would
                            declare independence, which would involve Equateur and Bakongo.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>, with every evidence
                            sincerity, said <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would be
                            judged fairly and legally and would be permitted to bring in foreign
                            lawyers if he chose to defend himself. He assured Ambassadors present no
                            physical violence would be done to him. Nussbaumer said that last
                                Thursday<note n="1" xml:id="d238fn1">October 6.</note> he went three
                            times to <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> with warrant of
                            arrest. First time <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> told him
                            warrant was not legal, second time there was difficulty with Ghanaian
                            troops guarding <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> which
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> said he would remove,
                            and third time asked why he insisted on arrest when everything could be
                            arranged. Nussbaumer saw <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>
                            yesterday morning for fourth time with warrant of arrest (the one which
                            I personally saw) and he was left with impression warrant could not be
                            served.</p>
                        <p>During meeting I asked <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>
                            whether any other solution possible, to which he replied “no.” I asked

                            replied this impossible while <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                        <p>I said earlier information yesterday indicated that Congolese troops
                            might be contemplating literal assault on <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s house in effort enforce arrest and that in my
                            considered opinion this would be serious error which would greatly
                            influence attitude other nations toward Congo since it would be direct
                            defiance <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Suggested present position
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> good and should be maintained.
                            In any case no good end would be served by “shooting way in.” Other
                            Ambassadors agreed. Added that in my opinion it would be better to
                            withdraw troops encircling <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>’s house and rely upon service of warrant by small

                            position if it assumed prerogative of deciding legality of warrant of
                            arrest which apparently issued by competent authority (Attorney General
                            Rom was appointed by <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> as he felt the
                            situation in the Congo had changed somewhat since he had seen Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d239fn1">On September 26; see <ref target="#d231">Document
                                    231</ref>.</note> He said that he believed we were living in
                            fateful days and that the major question now was who was to be the
                            strong man in the Congo. He added that there were two candidates,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>, the former supported by the
                            Communists. He then commented that he had the impression the Communists
                            were united and had decided what their strategy should be whereas the
                            Western camp was undecided and seemed to be waiting to see who would
                            win. He added he <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0552"/>did not feel
                            that there was any question but that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had been dismissed legally. On the other hand it
                            was true that a new government would have to receive the approval of
                            Parliament. He said that both houses of Parliament were inexperienced
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, who was a sorcerer,
                            was able to turn them upside down. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> asked him at this point if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> could be kept away from the
                            Parliament when it met. This prompted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> to refer to the warrant of arrest for <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> which the U.N. forces had
                            refused to recognize on grounds of parliamentary immunity. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said this was an untenable
                            position as, in trying to usurp power, <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had put himself outside the law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then indicated that the
                            second point he wanted to bring up was the Katanga situation. He
                            expressed concern over the criticism of the Belgian role in the Katanga.
                            He said his Government wants to recreate the unity of the Congo as much
                            as anyone else. He cited as evidence of this Mr. Tshombe’s statement
                            that the Belgians were opposed to independence for the Katanga. He also
                            cited support of talks between <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and Tshombe and indicated that if these talks
                            could take place, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            position would be weakened. Going on to a discussion of Belgian officers
                            and technicians in the Katanga he said that they had remained in the
                            Katanga because Tshombe wanted them and because order prevails. He added
                            that certain of the Belgians wanted Belgian army officers to remain but
                            that he had insisted that they leave. He was therefore all the more
                            indignant about criticism of the Belgians on this score. As for these
                            allegations he said that one of these officers was a Frenchman, one was
                            unknown to the Belgians and one was a Belgian officer discharged in
                            1949.</p>
                        <p>He went on to mention the officers of Belgian nationality in the Force
                            Publique in the Katanga. He said that they were Congolese officers.
                            Indeed they could not even be integrated into the Belgian army without
                            being subject to an examination. In response to a question from Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, he explained that
                            there were some 200 officers and non-commissioned officers in the Force
                            Publique in the Katanga. He said if these officers were pulled out chaos
                            would reign in the Katanga. At this point Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> interjected a remark that after
                            all the Ghanaian army has British officers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then went on to the third
                            point on the state of the private sector in the Congo. He said that if
                            the proper authorities are supported by the U.N. and by technicians then
                            order could be restored and the economy could recover. He added that
                            Belgian technicians could not remain however without receiving some

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then concluded by
                            returning to his original point. He said that the duel between <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> supported by the Communists,
                            Moroccans, Guineans and Ghanaians and the other candidates supported by
                            everyone else had begun. He added that if the latter had a chance he was
                            sure the future would be brighter. He called on the U.S. to press the
                            U.N. to give them a chance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> opened his remarks by
                            stating he was pleased the U.S. was able to work more closely with the
                            Belgians recently than in the past on some occasions. He then referred
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and said he would
                            not be as shy as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> had
                            been in referring to him. He added that if he is not a Communist, he is
                            a tool of the Communists and therefore hopeless. He stated that as the
                            Belgians knew the U.S. had recognized <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> as chief of state and tried to persuade him to
                            pick someone effective as prime minister. It was obvious to him that
                            neither <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> nor Ileo nor
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, for that matter,
                            was strong enough, but perhaps <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> was the man. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> continued that we had also urged the U.N. to deal
                            with the government of <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> as
                            the legal government. He indicated that we agreed that it would be
                            helpful to clear up the situation by having Parliament get rid of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, but that there was no
                            point in having such a meeting if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> could not be taken care of.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> expressed the hope that
                            there would not be a clash between the U.N. forces and the Congo forces
                            trying to arrest <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. He
                            wondered if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> could not be
                            arrested when he goes out on one of his tours of the city. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reiterated the desire of the US
                            to be of all possible help. He said an Ambassador had been trying to
                            shore up <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and urging him
                            not to deal with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then turned to the
                            question of the Katanga and said that we understood the Belgian position
                            on the Katanga. He said, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> understood, the US believed that the Katanga
                            should stay within the Congolese state if for no other reason than to
                            keep the economy viable. He also stated our interest in getting
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and Tshombe together.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that the US was
                            receptive to any ideas which might be developed on the isolation of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, the more rapidly, the
                            better. He even asked if it might not be better if <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would go to Ghana for example.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> at this point spoke
                            up to say that if he left for Ghana he might be back in Stanleyville
                            tomorrow. In a further discussion of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said he understood the reaction to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as he had heard him talk here in
                            Washington and he was very persuasive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> stressed again the
                            fateful days ahead and urged that we use our influence with Mr.
                            Hammarskjold in coping with the Congo problem. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stated he thought Mr.
                            Hammarskjold had <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0554"/>done a good
                            job in the Congo. Mr. Wigny quickly agreed but said other powers were
                            exerting pressure on Mr. Hammarskjold and that counter-pressure should
                            also come from our side.</p>

                        <p>Secto 40. Congo. Following from uncleared memo of conversation:</p>
                        <p>During courtesy call Secretary paid <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            this evening (<persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> also
                            present), Hammarskjold made following points:</p>
                        <p>1. Situation in Congo, he said, continued extremely messy. No one person
                            there strong enough to depend upon for future. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> was doing absolutely nothing.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> was weak reed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> very likely dope
                            addict. <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> suspected of
                            being imperialist stooge. In short there was no one on scene who could
                            be really helpful in bringing order out of chaos. In this connection,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> commented it would be
                            ruinous for US [<hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            </hi>?] to tie its policy closely to any one of these individuals.</p>
                        <p>2. In present situation <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> remarked only
                            thing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could do was to steer very
                            careful course allowing things to develop for while.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect possible arrest of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> commented
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> had “made
                            noises” in <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>’s direction
                            presumably expressing conviction <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            should permit arrest. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> expressed
                            conviction <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could not possibly do this
                            for variety of reasons including fact <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had parliamentary immunity.</p>
                        <p>4. In present circumstances <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> thought
                            best hope perhaps was to build toward leadership for legislative body in
                            Congo. Difficulty here was that some members were “bought up”, some were
                            in hiding and many of course could not be relied upon.</p>
                        <p>5. Idea of Afro-Asian advisory committee for Congo had died down but now
                            rejuvenated with coming of Sekou Toure. Newest idea among some
                            Afro-Asians was such committee should be formed and should have Krishna

                        <p>7. Nehru, he said, had come to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> session
                            on pretty sound ground. Subsequently, however, he had been subjected to
                            great deal of pressure from African delegates and had softened
                            somewhat.</p>

                        <p>1. We appreciate fully political considerations <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> sees in serving warrant for arrest <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> at this time. We believe arrest
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> at this time would
                            only be playing in hands extremists in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            and create storm there which would probably aggravate situation
                            seriously. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. In any event arrest does
                            not appear feasible since it would require Hammarskjold concurrence
                            which he is definitely not prepared give, at least at this time. He has
                            not only gone on public record to this effect but has made forceful
                            presentation to Secretary. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. On other hand, failure partially satisfy <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"

                                >UN</gloss> troops. Such developments likely undermine irreparably
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position in Congo. We believe way
                            out must be found in order break impasse in which legitimate authorities
                            obstructed in seeking conduct activities of government by constant
                            activities of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. We have following suggestions which we believe completely legal and
                            can be fully justified by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as
                            reasonable action in circumstances. We agree fully that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should continue protect <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> continues reside in
                            Prime Minister’s house he continues hold symbol of authority to which he
                            not entitled under <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> constitution. We
                            believe, therefore, that rather than permitting at this time serving of
                            warrant of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> for his arrest,
                            that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should effect <persName

                            him. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. We do not believe <gloss

                            justify its action in removing <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> from Prime Minister’s house not only on basis
                            request from <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            constitutional position but also on grounds <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s personal safety can better be protected.</p>
                        <p>In making above points you should call to <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> attention following legal considerations which we

                            the situation there remained much as it was a week ago. It was
                            approaching a crisis because <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>, the military “strong man”, may soon move against

                            cryptic statements that he would take action. Such action would create a
                            difficult problem, involving conflict with the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. There were a thousand Congolese troops around <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> only if his
                            parliamentary immunity is lifted by the Congolese Parliament. There was
                            some talk of convening the Parliament to get his immunity withdrawn.
                            Mobutu believes he could get through a favorable vote on this issue.</p>

                            possible that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> had

                            direction in which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is headed at
                            the moment is to get the Congolese Parliament re-assembled with a view
                            to getting its full backing for someone. We do not think so much of the
                            Foreign Minister, whom we once thought could provide the necessary
                            leadership. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            pointed out in this connection that the Foreign Minister was viewed by
                            other nations as a Western stooge. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            observed nonetheless that this was the best man we had.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> went on to state
                            that the U.S. Ambassador in the Congo was concerned about the
                            possibility that the Congolese troops would carry out their threat to
                            arrest <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> tried to stop them, it would create a
                            very bad situation. Accordingly, we had been trying to think of some
                            alternative and had made a suggestion to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> on Wednesday night. Perhaps the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> has some reason for protecting the parliamentary
                            immunity of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> despite the
                            fact that it did not protect other individuals on this basis when
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was in power. We were
                            suggesting to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, however, that there
                            was no reason why <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should
                            remain in possession of the prime minister’s mansion. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has the full right to dismiss
                            him. At one time earlier we did ask to have <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> moved out but the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> had refused. On Wednesday we had asked the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to reconsider its refusal. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agreed and <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was moved out, we would tell the Congolese that
                            this act represented a prestige gain for Mobutu but that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should not be arrested for the
                            time being. Instead we would recommend that he be put in some less
                            conspicuous place. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> asked in this
                            connection whether it would be bad if Lumumba left the <pb n="529"

                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said it would be all right
                            provided he did not use the opportunity to go to Stanleyville.”

                                    >USUN</gloss>, October 14, reported that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WJJ2">Wadsworth</persName> had been unable to
                                arrange an interview with <persName corresp="#p_HD3"
                                    >Hammarskjöld</persName> and that the Mission had therefore
                                discussed the subject with Wieschhoff. The latter had expressed the
                                view that political relationships in the Congo were so unstable and
                                complex that neither permitting <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                    >Lumumba</persName>’s arrest nor shifting him to another
                                residence was likely to have permanent results; the difficulties
                                exceeded the possible gains. He thought the best thing Mobutu could
                                do would be to keep <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> in
                                isolation by keeping a tight cordon around the residence. (<hi

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We called on <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> this morning to tell
                            him we thought <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> should be
                            removed from Prime Minister’s residence because of psychological impact
                            this would have. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said residence was
                            merely one house in row of others along river where Congolese never went
                            and he doubted whether moving him would make any difference. We replied
                            that it did make difference in psychological impression externally and
                            inasmuch as <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had been
                            legally deposed we thought symbols of office should be taken away from
                            him.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he still regarded <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as being <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss>. He said he had always taken position <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> divesting or [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>] was legal but because of surrounding circumstances and
                            general situation this act did not have intended legal consequences;
                            Ileo govt had never been presented to Parliament and Ileo was phantom
                            who was nowhere to be seen. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had further clouded issue by appointing College
                            of Commissioners whose Commissioner General (<persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName>) was supposedly FonMin in Ileo govt. Only
                            parliamentary action since deposition of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had been to re-endorse <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s status as <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, regardless of what might be said about
                            size of vote and circumstances surrounding it. We said according our
                            info <hi rend="italic">Loi Fondamentale</hi> based on existing Belgian
                            constitutional law to which <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0560"/>one
                            should look for interpretation for Congo. By terms of this, old govt
                            loses caretaker status from moment new govt is named, even before
                            parliamentary approval. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> recognized
                            that Belgian practice was different from that of Sweden, Italy and some
                            other European countries where deposed govt automatically becomes
                            caretaker govt. He seemed to dismiss this difference as unapplicable and
                            said because of lack of legal follow-up and confusion created by various
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> actions he could only
                            regard <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as PM.</p>
                        <p>3. We then said that basic problem with which we were concerned was that
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions in recent weeks had tended
                            to build up <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and weaken
                            efforts to create alternative govt. If he could not move <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> from PM’s house perhaps there
                            were some other steps he could take which would help bolster prestige of
                            others. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said this was perfectly
                            valid objective for Timberlake and U.S. but it could not be objective
                            for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; on this our views would simply
                            have to differ.</p>
                        <p>4. We also raised question of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            protecting <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> while he
                            traveled around city. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said this was
                            error for which Ghanaian troops had been reprimanded and which he did
                            not expect to reoccur.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> himself expressed concern about
                            good offices commission, especially about efforts Menon seems to be
                            making to get on commission. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> felt
                            Menon would try to undermine Narayanan,<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2"
                                >Probably Chakravarthi Vijayaraghava Narasimhan, U.N. Under
                                Secretary for Special Political Affairs.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> and Rikhye, all of whom were
                            “anti-Menon” Indians. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> While he obviously
                            wants to avoid or delay good offices commission, we are doubtful whether
                            he will exercise much initiative in doing so.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> again said he regarded <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> as of little value. He said he
                            had just received telegram from <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> denying he had concurred in another recent
                            telegram to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> critical of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and signed <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>. (We are not clear what telegram this is, but
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he has received
                            communications daily from them.) He also seems to think <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is leaning again toward
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> at moment.</p>
                        <p>7. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said one of his main objectives at
                            moment is to “break” Tshombe. He plans to do this by insisting that all
                            help to Tshombe come through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, e.g.,
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> plans to get rid of all
                            Tshombe’s Belgian advisers and supporters. He then hopes to bring
                            Tshombe into Leopoldville picture, thus producing change in general
                            political situation there.</p>
                        <p>8. He expressed little regard for Kanza, implying Kanza consistently
                            adjusting his position to whomever will come out on top.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> raised question of warrant for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s arrest. He said it
                            was clearly improper. One part of warrant accused <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> of political crime while another
                            referred to him as parliamentary deputy. <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                                facs="0561"/>Parliamentary deputies had immunity from arrest for
                            political activities. He fully concurred with <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName>’s position that this was effort at “political
                            violence” and “prima-facie” case not made for arrest.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> also said he had revised his
                            previous estimates about Sov activities in Congo. He had always thought
                            they endeavored to get into Congo in major way at end July and early
                            August, after problem had developed. He now thinks they were involved in

                        <p>11. He told us Guinea had made effort to send unit of 200 more men into
                            Congo. He was not specific as to how this was approached, but he said
                            issue had been raised to <gloss target="#t_HQ1">HQ</gloss> level and he
                            had told Guineans this would be contrary to <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> resolutions on Congo prohibiting introduction any
                            military assistance except through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He
                            implied <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not accept any more
                            Guinean troops. He also told us <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had
                            sent some of its units to Leopoldville without <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> approval. He had taken this up directly with Nasser who
                            had issued orders that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops were
                            to obey <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> orders fully. <gloss

                                >UAR</gloss> troops had subsequently withdrawn at <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> request. He also said Ghanaians had sent
                            plane with Welbeck and 60 persons, whose status he did not know, toward
                            Leopoldville last week, but they had turned back. He said he did not
                            understand how Congolese could refuse Welbeck’s return, as he was
                            Ghanaian Chargé, and relations had not been broken, but this seemed to
                            be position Mobutu was taking.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It was obvious from this conversation
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is not now prepared to take any
                            steps to diminish <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            position and he will continue to provide protection to <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> even though this may result in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> bolstering his position in Congo.
                            (He observed that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had to act on basis
                            of principles; these principles had previously worked in favor of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and others; they were
                            now working in favor of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.)
                            While we have no reason to believe he has changed his views about
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, it seems apparent
                            that heavy Soviet attack against him coupled particularly with support
                            of Lumumba and public or private criticisms by usual group of
                            Afro-Asians, have resulted in <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            shifting toward position involving accommodation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. This was already evident in
                            previous conversations we have had with him when he supported necessity
                            of some type of “reconciliation” in Congo. It is even clearer now. Our
                            estimate is that this is effort on his part to accommodate himself to
                            what he feels are realities of political forces at play, that while he
                            would be delighted to see <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>

                            must not risk creation of administrative and security vacuum in Katanga
                            which would only add immeasurably to difficulties in rest of Congo.</p>
                        <p>1. How many technicians and para-military personnel does <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> believe involved? As we understand it,
                            number in Katanga alone might be on order of some 900, in fields of
                            public administration, technical services, judiciary as well as police
                            and security forces. Obvious that withdrawal, without trained
                            replacements, could result in <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0563"

                            and widespread lawlessness can be averted?</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> propose guarantee public order?

                        <p>3. How would <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> propose meet additional

                            as he requested? How much money would be involved?</p>

                            of Katanga personnel to replace Belgians?</p>
                        <p>You should also point out that we had understood Belgian technicians in

                            to return Soviet and Czech Embassies which would become bases for
                            renewed penetration.</p>
                        <p>I am still satisfied provincial leaders would resist to greatest possible
                            degree any cooperation with any government in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> has any position and that task
                            of such government would be immeasurably frustrated. If there is to be
                            any peaceful and constructive reunification in the Congo, <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> must, in our opinion, be
                            isolated and certainly not supported. I have expressed such personal
                            opinion to <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> on at least two
                            occasions pointing out that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> task
                            already difficult but would become major headache should <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> return as those of us here in

                            arrests of <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName>, et al, I have
                            little faith in such method unless competent court can be established to
                            consider case promptly. Furthermore, I would prefer see question
                            parliamentary immunity resolved by Parliament itself lifting his
                            immunity. That involves reconvening Parliament which raises even more
                            important problem of who [<hi rend="italic">how</hi>?] it would vote on
                            government confidence measure. While some of Commissioners and Ileo
                            Government think they have lined up enough votes to defeat <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and/or approve new government, I
                            am, out of experience with their wishful thinking, inclined to doubt
                            such claims at this point. Votes are cheap and intimidation goes on
                            daily as attack on Ndele and other opponents of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> are perpetrated with impunity so
                            far. As matter fact, <gloss target="#t_CNA1">CNA</gloss> is almost
                            certainly training goon squads in camp near Leopoldville for such
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Men in street, particularly opponents of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, are simply not convinced <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> is impartial. They see <persName corresp="#p_LP3"

                            They know Kettani took <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> and

                            matters clearly involving them in Congo internal affairs. They also know

                            troops refused calls for help. Last attack on Ndele was carried out in

                            civilian bystanders. Question now being asked is “who is the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> neutral against?”</p>
                        <p>Government of Commissioners is admittedly temporary but has made some
                            real if small effort toward constructive administration. It has been
                            rebuffed by <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> who considers
                            members unimportant school boys and its prestige has suffered from
                            events noted preceding <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0566"

                                >Mobutu</persName>’s troops is angry and restive for same reasons.
                            While I am unhappy over poor prospects for early Parliamentary solution,
                            I think we should make effort support Commissioners so long as they are
                            actually in place and are at least trying to do good job for Congo. I
                            certainly feel every effort must be made to knock down Ghana, Guinea,
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> intervention which continues
                            apace. In particular, Welbeck is still strutting about Leopoldville in
                            spite of fact <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> declared him persona
                            non grata. Believe they will endeavor put him physically on plane for

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will not prevent such action.
                            Furthermore, problem isolating <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> at residence complicated since Ghana, Guinea and
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> have access to him and are
                            suspected carrying money and messages to and from <persName

                            which has been deposed. Fact few Congolese pass house is no argument;
                            every one in Leopoldville and country would know almost immediately he
                            had been removed just as they know he is there. I still feel <gloss

                            important for these to be clearly understood. Following considerations
                            are provided for your guidance:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has said he still regards
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as Prime Minister.
                            This represents a shift from <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            position both from legal as well as political point of view. On

                        <p>From legal point of view <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> appears be
                            basing his position on thesis that since parliament has not confirmed
                            Ileo government, <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> remains
                            Prime Minister. On legal question, it remains our position that Congo
                            Constitution gave President <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> power to dismiss <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. Congolese Constitution clearly relates to
                            Belgian parliamentary system and not to that of other continental or
                            British systems. Article 22 gives President power to appoint Prime
                            Ministers as well as to dismiss them. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> has appointed new government, the Ileo
                            government. Although Constitution does not expressly cover case like
                            this, the only case in which it calls for outgoing government to
                            continue in caretaker capacity is when government resigns as result of
                            parliamentary vote of no confidence. This quite logical since parliament
                            cannot appoint successor government. But it would be illogical to expect
                            Constitution to make such provision applicable when Chief of <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0568"/>State dismisses cabinet since he can
                            immediately provide successor government. This <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has done. Hence we regard
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as legally dismissed
                            as Prime Minister and Ileo cabinet as de jure government. This is case
                            even though this government still has to go before parliament for formal
                            vote of confidence in accordance with article 22 of Constitution which
                            sets no time limit within which this must take place.</p>
                        <p>2. More important than legal considerations are political and practical
                            results which we believe would ensue if <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> in fact insists on moving on two fronts: breaking
                            Tshombe and removing all Belgian influence from Katanga coupled with
                            political and pragmatic accommodation with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. We appreciate fully pressure that <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has been under from <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover, we understand completely
                            reasons for doing everything feasible for maintaining maximum support
                            among Africans and Asians. But Department would be less than frank if we
                            did not inform Hammarskjold now that as we see it practical results of
                            moving along two fronts he has indicated will mean return of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to power, renewed demands by him
                            for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to withdraw, massive Soviet
                            intervention, fraught with possibility of major international conflict.
                            We are confident that this is not what Hammarskjold wants—in fact <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has made clear in past his view <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot work with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>—but we nevertheless do not see
                            how from practical point of view Hammarskjold actions along two fronts
                            noted above can lead to anything other than bringing Congo back to state
                            of chaos in which it was found when <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            operation was launched. If question is matter of timing and Hammarskjold
                            is thinking in terms of temporary slowdown in pragmatic steps that can
                            help to bring about kind of result which we and he have wanted this is
                            one thing. However, if views which he expressed represent change in
                            objectives then it would be well for us and <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> to understand this clearly, since this will require
                            fundamental reassessment of situation on our part.<note n="6"

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> began his briefing on the Congo by
                            stating that the situation was not much changed. Unfortunately, we do
                            not think that <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s position
                            is worsening and may, in fact, be improving because of the support it is
                            receiving from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops, [<hi

                            it appears that the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Ghana, and
                            Guinea may make a proposal in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                            a good offices delegation which would go to the Congo to seek political
                            reconciliation. The effect of such reconciliation would be to restore
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to power. Morocco was
                            also backing <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, [less than 1

                            soldiers had attempted to assassinate Mobutu on the 15th of October. The
                            U.S. had prior information of this attempt and had warned <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. The attempt, however, had
                            shaken him. If he had not been warned, it was probable that he would
                            have been caught.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> had now dropped his idea
                            of reconvening Parliament and planned to carry on with his group of
                            administrators until the end of the year. He was optimistic if he
                            thought that he could actually do so. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            referred to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>’s meeting
                            with Tshombe in Katanga and to the agreement between the <gloss

                                >UN</gloss> troops should be moved into a rebel area in Katanga. He
                            noted that on the 19th of October, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> had arrested a group of <persName

                            been released almost immediately. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            concluded by stating that the situation in the Congo was about the same
                            as it had been and that action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            appeared to be the next development.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that the
                            most disturbing aspect of the situation was Hammarskjold’s apparent
                            change of heart. How much of this was due to the hammering he had
                            received from the Soviets and how much was the result of pressure from
                            others we did not know. Hammarskjold had sent a stiff letter to Tshombe
                            and to the Belgians requesting <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0570"
                            />them to get rid of all Belgians in Katanga. Such action would probably
                            lead to considerable chaos in Katanga. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TCH1">Timberlake</persName> was very worried about the
                            new Hammarskjold line. Mr. Bohlen was going to talk to Hammarskjold and
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WJJ2">Wadsworth</persName>. During the last
                            week Hammarskjold had put a curse on everyone in the Congo, indicating
                            that there was not a single individual in the Congo on whom one could
                            rely. Hammarskjold’s thinking then and now was to get the Congolese
                            Parliament in session. One difficulty in this connection was that the
                            members of Parliament were afraid to go to Leopoldville.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> went on to
                            describe the economic deterioration that was taking place in the Congo.
                            A half-million dollars had been allocated for public works for the
                            unemployed. Probably two-thirds of the people in Leopoldville were
                            without jobs. We were afraid that Hammarskjold’s new line will mean the
                            re-appearance of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Cordier
                            has stated that if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> once
                            more becomes the principal figure in the Congo, there would be no place
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; in such a situation the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might as well pull out. The U.S.
                            has put up money twice for the Congo. In addition to the one-half
                            million dollars for public works, we had put money up for imports of
                            spare parts in order to get some kind of industrial activity going.
                            However, there was not anyone in the Congo who could handle this money.
                            Soviet and Chinese money has been coming into the Congo and no one is
                            sure who is bought by whom. We hope that someone will get parliamentary
                            support and that this will clarify the situation. For <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to get back in would just not be
                            the answer, however.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> asked how much we could
                            rely on the alleged disaffection of the members of Parliament from
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> stated that Ileo had been going
                            around the country talking to members of Parliament and was quite
                            optimistic. He thinks he can get Parliament to back <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>. We did not know, however, how
                            many members of Parliament would come back to Leopoldville. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that the
                            “black satchel” operation of the Soviets and Chinese also made the
                            outcome of a parliamentary vote doubtful. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> observed that how the vote went depended
                            on who controlled the troops in Leopoldville at the time of the vote.
                            Even if members of the Parliament were bought by someone or other, it
                            would be the control of force that would be determinant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> said that he did not know
                            what our limits were in dealing with Hammarskjold but he thought that
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was taking a peculiar position
                            when it stated that, if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            came back, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be out of the
                            Congo, and yet that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had a
                            responsibility to bring <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            back. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> felt we should do
                            everything we could to change Hammarskjold’s view. If Hammarskjold was
                            worried about <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>, we
                            should give him some assurances. We should use our <pb n="541"
                                xml:id="pg_541" facs="0571"/>best persuasive power to convince him
                            that he is not obligated to do something which will result in having the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> kicked out of the Congo. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> observed that we were
                            likely to get the same negative reaction from Hammarskjold on this as
                            when we had approached him on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s
                            efforts to prevent the arrest of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and the relationship of this action, which was
                            very favorable to dangerous elements, to the neutrality of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> pointed out that Guinea had introduced a
                            resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> calling for the
                            seating of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s delegation.
                            The new African states had caucused on this resolution and except for
                            Mali and, possibly, Togo and the Ivory Coast, these states were opposed
                            to the resolution. We doubt that these states would favor the seating of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s representatives but
                            they are definitely against <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. This fact could affect Hammarskjold’s thinking.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that there
                            were indications of disagreement among Hammarskjold’s advisers within
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretariat.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Franke inquired about progress in moving Western technicians
                            into the Congo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            stated that such movement had now stopped; there was no one that you
                            could deal with in the Congo; there was no government that could make an
                            agreement. Seventeen technicians had got in at the start and these were
                            all still in the Congo. The move to push the Belgians out was bad;
                            eventually, they would have to leave but now they were the only
                            stabilizing force. He stated there had been no indication of an answer
                            to Hammarskjold’s letter to Tshombe. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that this letter had been
                            printed in a Brussels paper. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out
                            that some Belgian technicians were back in the Congo as a result of
                            invitations from local officials. In one case a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> official had tried to prevent such a Belgian from
                            returning but his efforts had been repulsed by the Congolese official
                            concerned. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said
                            that he had talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJAII1"
                                >Palmer</persName>, our new Ambassador to Nigeria, a country to
                            which evacuees had moved from the Congo. Many of these evacuees,
                            particularly the missionaries, had now gone back. Mr. McCone noted that
                            mining operations in Katanga continued on a normal basis. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> said that the Presbyterians who
                            had returned to their missions in the Congo had found no damage to their
                            property; it remained just as they had left it.</p>

                            preparatory to subsequent discussion with him:</p>
                        <p>“I have been requested by the Secretary of State to discuss with you
                            certain matters relating to the Congo and to express to you our current
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The objectives of the United States in regard to the Congo are the same
                            as have been previously expressed to you. We want the United Nations
                            effort in the Congo to succeed. We have supported the United Nations
                            fully and continue to support it fully to this end. We want to see a
                            free and independent Congo. We want to keep the cold war entirely out of
                            the Congo. We are confident these objectives are the Secretary General’s
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>However, we believe it would be desirable to have a frank discussion
                            regarding certain developments in relationship to the Congo about which
                            we are seriously concerned as well as the methods currently being

                            also concerned because of the latest information which we have received

                        <p>First, we wish to express the views of the United States regarding the

                            explicitly gives the President of the Republic power to dismiss the

                                Fondamentale</hi> calls for an outgoing government to continue in a
                            caretaker capacity is when the government resigns as a result of a
                            parliamentary vote of no confidence. This is quite logical inasmuch as
                            only the President, and not Parliament, can appoint a successor
                            government, and since the President could not be expected to work with a
                            government he has dismissed even in a caretaker capacity. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Loi Fondamentale</hi> does not provide for an outgoing
                            government to be a caretaker government when the Chief of State
                            dismisses a Cabinet or Prime Minister as he has authority to do, since
                            he can also immediately appoint a successor government, both actions
                            being provided for in Article 22. This President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has done. Hence we regard Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as legally dismissed
                            as Prime Minister and Prime Minister Ileo and his Cabinet as
                            constituting the de jure government of the Republic of the Congo. This
                            is the case even though this government still has to be before
                            Parliament for a formal vote of confidence in accordance with Article 22
                            of the Constitution. Article 22, of course, stipulates no time limit
                            within which this must take place. Regardless of any views which may be
                            held about subsequent steps in the Congo and any implications resulting
                            from the creation of the College of Commissioners, it seems to us clear
                            that the government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> has been legally dismissed and that neither he
                            nor his former government has any current status under the law of the
                            Republic of the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the United States is seriously concerned also about your
                            démarche to the Government of Belgium requesting it to withdraw all its
                            personnel from the Congo and that it provide all assistance, including
                            economic assistance, exclusively through the United Nations. Whatever
                            might be the merits of providing that all assistance to the
                            Congo—economic as well as military—should be undertaken through the
                            United Nations, the General Assembly did not take this decision at its
                            emergency session. There was even difficulty in assuring that in
                            addition to military assistance, assistance which might be used for <pb
                                n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0574"/>military purposes would be
                            exclusively confined to the United Nations. We believe that recent
                            events, including the <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                            >Mobutu</persName>–Tshombe meeting, give evidence that Tshombe is
                            prepared to cooperate within the framework of a unified Congo and is not
                            pressing a secessionist line. Many members of his Cabinet are more
                            extreme secessionists, however, so the alternative to Tshombe would
                            probably be a good deal worse in terms of the Congo. For our part we
                            will continue to work within the framework of a unified Congo. We also
                            feel that the recent Berendsen–Tshombe agreement for the division of
                            public security responsibility in the Katanga is a helpful step and
                            would welcome further United Nations actions along these lines.</p>
                        <p>We do feel, however, that we must not risk the creation of an
                            administrative and security vacuum in the Katanga which would only add
                            immeasurably to the difficulties in the rest of the Congo. The United
                            States could not support any action which would result in the extension
                            to the Katanga of the instability which was experienced in the rest of
                            the Republic of the Congo and we would urge that the United Nations not
                            move precipitously.</p>
                        <p>With these concerns in mind we would appreciate your views on how many
                            government technicians and paramilitary personnel you believe would be
                            involved in a full withdrawal of all Belgian Government personnel from
                            the Congo, and whether you would be in a position to replace them
                            immediately so that a major exodus of private Europeans in the Katanga
                            and the possibility of widespread lawlessness could be averted. It is
                            our understanding that the number of personnel involved in the Katanga
                            alone might be on the order of some 900 in the field of public
                            administration, government technical services, and judiciary, as well as
                            police and security forces. Without trained replacements such a
                            withdrawal could well result in chaos.</p>
                        <p>In circumstances involving the withdrawal of Belgian technicians we
                            wonder what steps the United Nations could take to guarantee the
                            maintenance of public order, especially inasmuch as difficulty along
                            these lines still prevails even in Leopoldville itself. It would also be
                            helpful to know how much money would be involved in meeting the
                            additional costs which would be incurred if all Belgian technicians were
                            to leave, and how you would propose to meet these costs and what plans
                            you may have for the training of Katanga personnel to replace the
                            Belgians.</p>
                        <p>We are also seriously concerned about the political and practical results
                            which might ensue if the authority of provincial leaders is broken down
                            at the same time that political and pragmatic accommodations seem to be
                            taking place with former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The United States appreciates the extreme pressures that you have been
                            under and we fully understand the necessity for maintaining maximum
                            support among African and Asian members of the <pb n="545"
                                xml:id="pg_545" facs="0575"/>United Nations. However, we also
                            believe that the majority of African nations do not support Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and the United States
                            would be less than frank if it did not inform you that we feel the
                            practical results of moving in the direction which now appears to be
                            developing would mean the return of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> to power, renewed demands by him for the United
                            Nations to withdraw, and a renewal of Soviet intervention fraught with
                            the possibility of a major international conflict. We are confident this
                            is not what you desire—in fact you have expressed to us your own views
                            that the United Nations cannot work with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>—but we do not see how, from a practical point of
                            view, the present situation can lead to anything other than bringing
                            back the state of chaos which existed when the United Nations operation
                            was launched. The information which the United States has indicates that
                            the provincial leaders of the Congo—not only Tshombe—would resist to the
                            greatest possible degree cooperation with any government in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is associated and that
                            such a government would not result in the maintenance of Congolese
                            unity.</p>
                        <p>The actions of the United Nations in recent weeks have served to give the
                            impression that the United Nations continues to regard Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as Prime Minister of the Congo
                            and to protect him as the Prime Minister, while failing to protect other
                            members of Parliament and Cabinet officers of the government of Prime
                            Minister Ileo or members of the College of Commissioners. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is protected by the United
                            Nations in the residence and office of the Prime Minister and the United
                            Nations has prevented warrants of arrest being presented on him, and it
                            has refused to effect Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                            >Lumumba</persName>’s removal from the Prime Minister’s residence. On
                            the one hand the United Nations intervened to release from arrest Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> and Mr. Mpolo, and
                            within the last day intervened to obtain the release of a number of
                            supporters of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> within
                            hours after they were arrested, announcing, according to the information
                            available to us, that the United Nations always intervenes in the case
                            of “arbitrary arrests” and that they are doing so to prevent the
                            establishment of a military dictatorship in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, officials who are opposed to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> have been badly beaten by
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> supporters in the
                            presence of United Nations troops who either refused to intervene
                            entirely, in spite of requests for help, or did not intervene until
                            after the beatings had taken place. We refer specifically to the
                            beatings of Mr. Nussbaumer, Mr. Kandolo and Mr. Ndele.</p>
                        <p>If the views which you have recently expressed represent a basic change
                            in your approach to the Congo problem, which we assume is not the case,
                            the United States believes we should be informed of this, since it would
                            require a fundamental reassessment of the situation on the part of the
                            United States. For our part we can again assure you that <pb n="546"
                                xml:id="pg_546" facs="0576"/>the objectives of the United States
                            have not changed. We want the United Nations effort in the Congo to be a
                            success and we support it fully to that end. We want to keep the cold
                            war entirely out of the Congo. We want to see the Congo remain free,
                            independent, and united. We are confident that these continue to be your
                            objectives also but we are much convinced that the specific actions
                            which are now being taken will greatly complicate rather than facilitate
                            the achievement of these results and may even lead to their total
                            frustration.”</p>

                            legal analysis regarding constitutional situation, which had been
                            complicated by attempts by <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> to fire <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s retaliation, in which Parliament had hand. Out
                            of all this confusion however <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> took
                            position <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> did remain as
                            head of state. But he said <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had dropped Ileo by having suspended Parliament
                            and disavowed Ileo’s government. Hence Ileo could be disregarded. Given
                            suspension of Parliament, sole unclouded authority in Congo, in
                            Hammarskjold’s view, is that of Chief of State. “Yet whatever fragments
                            of Prime Minister’s authority remain are, due largely to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s way of handling it, in
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>”, said <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. He was “more <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss>” than anyone else. While <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> could [not?] “deal with him as <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss> he could not at same time be disregarded completely.
                            [”?]</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold at another point in conversation expanded on his legal view
                            of situation. He absolutely refused to accept theory that interpretation
                            of <hi rend="italic">Loi Fondamentale</hi>, in absence of any other
                            indicated rule of interpretation, should be based on Belgian practice.
                            As he put it, Belgians got Congolese to accept good deal of Belgian law
                            in their <hi rend="italic">Loi Fondamentale</hi>, “but there is no
                            reason to think Belgians got them to accept their (Belgian)
                            constitutional practice.”</p>
                        <p>In this way Hammarskjold refused to recognize our (and Belgian) arguments
                            re difference in caretaker status under Belgian and other continental
                            practices. Hammarskjold admitted he had said <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had acted legally in ending <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s mandate from Chief of State,
                            but maintained legal effect of this action was “very controversial”. He
                            went on to describe situation in this way: President had “withdrawn his
                            part of confidence” in <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>,
                            but Parliament’s part of confidence was not withdrawn. Hammarskjold then
                            said they (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) do not regard him as
                            “legitimate” Prime Minister, since if they did, <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> would be able to deal with him. Reason <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s withdrawal of confidence in
                            him has “to that extent” taken away his authority. It is this very fact
                            of not dealing with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> which
                            has been cause of extended criticism of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> by those who
                            insist <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is still Prime
                            Minister. (At another point it was mentioned <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> does deal with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> within limits his authority, for instance
                            writing letters to him.)</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold pursued same line in arguing against point in memorandum
                            regarding question of removing <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> from <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s
                            residence. Hammarskjold maintained there was no justification for such
                            step; Wieschhoff reiterated argument present residence not real <gloss
                                target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s residence in usually understood sense,
                            and no practical results would flow from removal. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> backed up Wieschhoff in
                            describing this as impractical step. Hammarskjold said his policy
                            “barred him from taking any action on basis <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is not <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>”. But
                            on opposite side of coin, he never dealt with <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> as if he were <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            in any <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0578"/>formal sense, by any
                            formal acts. Protection afforded is same as that for all other
                            “political dignitaries” who have asked for it. “They also are entitled
                            live in their own houses.”</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold said <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must “keep clean on
                            the record, wherever it may lead”. “What in past actions or behavior
                            seemed to indicate an anti-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            line by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> now seemingly indicated
                            opposite.” In fact there no change in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>’s line, he said; rather, change is in behavior of
                            individuals involved. He added that had <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> agreed to remove <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> from <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>’s
                            residence, assuming some justification could have been found, this
                            action would have created “partial martyrdom” for <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, which in turn would have
                            strengthened hand of those in General Assembly who advocate
                                pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> move. By not so
                            doing he felt that issue will peter out.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold also referred to question of warrant for arrest of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> “as deputy” [sic] which on its
                            face thereby invalid, since it was for “political” action. Such arrests
                            clearly being used as form of political violence, he said. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> required respect “due process” of law, he
                            said, and consequently refused act where obviously no due process.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Katanga and Belgium</p>
                        <p>Turning to that part of our memo re Katanga he said Katanga’s unity with
                            rest of Congo is political, legal and economic necessity. If allowed to
                            remain as separate identity it will mean cold war comes to central
                            Africa. Problem for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was how to get
                            them back into picture while remaining aloof from interference in
                            internal affairs. This could only be through diplomatic and political
                            means. So long as Tshombe can turn to Belgium, he will not go along with
                            cooperation with central government. In this Hammarskjold said he
                            disagreed with some assertions in our memo but was not explicit. He said
                            troop withdrawal had not been end of it so far as Belgians concerned.
                            And while Tshombe is not on Belgian side he nevertheless hangs on to
                            them, creating psychological factor against Tshombe’s turning for
                            reliance to Leopoldville.</p>
                        <p>With regard to US concern at <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s
                            démarche to Belgians, Hammarskjold said he has only asked of Belgians
                            what US has already asked—namely that all aid come through <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In measured tones Hammarskjold said
                            Belgians had been anything but helpful in this matter. He referred to
                            “special interests” working on behalf of Belgium, and spoke of
                            “systematic return of Belgians to Leopoldville” under control of
                            Commissioners. He hinted at collusion with regard to return of these
                            Belgians, and mentioned “coup d’état arrangements” under cover of which
                            “Belgian comeback” might be staged.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Other points in memo</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold stated that release of <persName corresp="#p_GA4"
                                >Gizenga</persName> and Mpolo was decision of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> himself and not <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. According his version, which came from
                            “the command”, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>’s
                            soldiers arrested not only these two <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> supporters but also two pro-<persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> men. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> came to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> (complaining for some unknown
                            reason to <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> about it), he said
                            he had had nothing to do with it and it was up to Mobutu to handle;
                            whereupon latter decided only way to get his men back was to release all
                            four individuals.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold said <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> is major risk in
                            whole picture. There had recently been in “native quarter” of
                            Leopoldville considerable amount looting, raping (of children according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName>) and general pillage at
                            hands <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss>, which Mobutu once controlled.
                            Such activity apparently explains remarks attributed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> in Friday Washington Post story
                            calling <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> “rabble”. This
                            disintegration of authority is another reason why <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> looks with less favor upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. At this point Hammarskjold
                            felt prompted to say <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot choose
                            men, nor their inclinations, but rather must take objective stand. What
                            is needed is constitutional authority including that of Parliament,
                            giving some semblance of legitimacy to Congo Government. This would and
                            should be case regardless whether such situation was proor
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said two separate and opposite
                            versions of story regarding Ndele existed. He did not elucidate upon
                            them. According to Bunche Ndele owes his life to intervention by
                            soldier(s) in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command.</p>
                        <p>According Hammarskjold there had been mistakes made. They were largely
                            errors committed by Ghana forces, and apparently by individuals within
                            them and not a part of some grand design. He said many steps taken
                            correct these errors. He said two brigadiers with Ghana forces seemed
                            all right but Welbeck (Ghana Chargé) and Djin were another story.</p>

                        <p>In general discussion which followed, Bohlen led off by stating that it
                            seemed apparent any re-assemblage of Parliament in near future out of
                            question because of fear by parliamentarians from provinces what might
                            happen to them. Everything pointed all too squarely to likely return to
                            power, unless something done, of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. On authority from Washington Bohlen then said
                            if <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> comes back into power,
                            US Government does not propose to stand idly by and allow Congo become
                            Communist satellite. In view of our strong support of <gloss

                            up to now on Congo question, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would
                            have fully to weigh possible drastic revision of our policy. Bohlen also
                                <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0580"/>referred to other
                            information our possession indicating things going on out there which
                            indicate Russians have not given up hope of returning at all.</p>
                        <p>Bohlen also sought clarification from <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            or <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4">Bunche</persName> re nationality of
                            soldiers in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force in Leopoldville,
                            many of whom had in one way or another cast doubt on their total loyalty
                            to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cause. <persName corresp="#p_BRJ4"
                                >Bunche</persName> said there were Sudanese troops at airport (and
                            also small number <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops); in city
                            there were Ghana and Moroccan troops.</p>
                        <p>After making absolutely clear US regarded present application <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s rule of impartiality as inevitably
                            operating in favor of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, and
                            of consequences this might have for US policy, Bohlen turned
                            conversation on to positive line by saying “What is important is to
                            figure out where we go from here”. This is endeavor in which US willing
                            and anxious help out in any proper way. Anything to change present
                            pattern of paralysis would be desirable. Bohlen informally suggested
                            possibility, starting from fixed point that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> is Chief of State, that he be urged appoint
                            caretaker government with perhaps <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> as <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> in background
                            possibly as Chief of Staff. It would be understood such government to be
                            temporary, for interim only, pending reassembling of Parliament for
                            purposes ratifying such government. Wieschhoff interjected at this point
                            that this is what <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been trying to
                            do for three weeks without success.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold seemed to react favorably to idea moving on to some more
                            constructive aspect of discussion. He said Parliament is one thing which
                            can do anything in Congo. To have it meet there are two prerequisites:
                            Security measures in Leopoldville; and presence of Katanga del. This
                            latter depends on Tshombe’s views. (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            nowhere near so confident, from their reports of good outcome from
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>’s talks in
                            Elisabethville.) Hammarskjold added that problem is not just in
                            Leopoldville—it is in provinces as well. He despaired of abilities of
                            leaders, saying each had missed every chance to do something effective.
                            Bohlen’s idea might work if there were some way to get it done. To put
                            such idea or any other into effect it was necessary to work through
                            someone. There was no one on whom to rely. There was complete lack of
                            effective personalities. He added without spelling it out that catalyst
                            was also required which could not be third government.</p>
                        <p>In this connection Hammarskjold referred to good offices idea which came
                            from res adopted by special emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            If such group were not homogeneous it would fall apart and create more
                            confusion. Hammarskjold inclined doubt one would be formed but in any
                            event he said he could not prevent it since it would be subcom of his
                            Advisory Committee, and decision to form such group would be <pb n="551"
                                xml:id="pg_551" facs="0581"/>theirs. His approach thus far, in hopes
                            preventing this development, had been “socratic”; he had asked questions
                            designed to frighten them away from taking such step, so far with some
                            success.</p>
                        <p>Although Hammarskjold never gave concrete answer on possibility of
                            caretaker govt along lines suggested by Bohlen, he did say such group
                            could not ignore <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. And he
                            also noted that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could not be sure in
                            any dealings it might have with such govt that these were any more than
                            on de facto basis.</p>
                        <p>Referring to impasse into which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s
                            policy appeared to have led it, Hammarskjold indicated that one way out
                            of such difficulty lay in possibility <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss> taking stand on particular issue. This would make it
                            possible for execution of policy (by <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                            >SYG</gloss>) to be lifted out of impasse. He felt <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>’s inaction re seating rep of Congo
                            made his impartial behavior as between different govt’l figures
                            absolutely consistent with overall <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            stand. Way to change it, he appeared to hint, would be by <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> decision.</p>
                        <p>Turning to question of Belgians (and Katanga), Hammarskjold referred to
                            new note he sent,<note n="6" xml:id="d249fn6">A note verbale to Loridan,

                            his stand regarding withdrawal of technicians and other. (For text see
                                <gloss target="#t_ourtel1">ourtel</gloss> 1098)<note n="7"

                        </p>
                        <p>He described his policy as “two-pronged” approach. To restore authority
                            to Leopoldville, and thereafter to all Congo; also to bring Katanga into
                            central picture. He said he felt he had to try to switch Tshombe’s
                            allegiance and dependence away from Belgians and on to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Now Tshombe was not just dependent on
                            Belgians, he was “overfed” by them. He had said he only needed 50
                            technicians and Belgians had provided 100. Such matters retain Belgian
                            hold over Tshombe. Different Belgian attitude could have made all
                            difference in handling. Instead they appeared be hanging on at all
                            costs.</p>
                        <p>To Bohlen’s query whether if Belgian technicians were put under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, situation would be better, Hammarskjold
                            several times avoided specific answer. Finally he admitted this would be
                            better, and he said for individual Belgians to be under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control in Congo as whole would not be
                            excluded by his policy. Those who must go were, as pointed out in his
                            earlier note, Belgians directly or indirectly under Belgian Govt
                            control. This he interpreted as “govt-sponsored Belgians, who were paid
                            directly or indirectly by Belgian Govt. Wieschhoff cited as example way
                            in which indirect payment comes about, system where Belgian Govt gives
                            subsidy to Katanga govt which in turn from that subsidy pays for
                            services of Belgian “technicians”.</p>
                        <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0582"/>
                        <p>Hammarskjold admitted this could become difficult line to draw. He said
                            it must be calculated against alternative, retention of Belgian control
                            which could be very dangerous. Existence of such “curious in-between
                            arrangements” required that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> “clean
                            things up”. At this point he digressed as if by illustration to refer to
                            troops in southern Kasai province, which were Belgian-officered troops
                            working for Kalonji. It was argued these officers had been “seconded”
                            from “Katanga” army and so were still not Belgians. Hammarskjold said
                            “simple fact is there is Belgian element of control”. He referred as
                            illustration to threat posed to Tshombe before <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces entered Katanga: Union Miniere said they would
                            close down all mines, putting 20,000 people out of work if Tshombe let
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces enter. Hammarskjold had
                            advised Tshombe not to bend under this pressure but to say he would in
                            such circumstances turn to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                            necessary technicians. Hammarskjold felt this was typical instance of
                            Belgian control.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, meeting having to break off by <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss>’s subsequent appointment, <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> agreed reality was what took place in area, and not
                            within <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>—that latter was largely
                            reflection of reality. However he insisted <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> could have influence on what happened in real world of
                            Leopoldville. Bohlen, as parting remark, summarized that net effect of
                            situation would seem to be that instead of keeping cold war out of
                            Congo, situation had developed into one-sided cold war. Only US had
                            stayed out. Soviets surely had not, nor was it anything more than naive
                            to think they would stay out.</p>
                        <p>Begin Bohlen comment: While we left no doubt as to seriousness with which
                            we view situation in Congo and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            attitude towards it, foregoing account of 2-hour conversation
                            nevertheless demonstrates inconclusive results insofar as any direct
                            expression of future policy by Hammarskjold was concerned. Our strongest
                            impression is that he sees no clear course of action in Leopoldville to
                            deal with the present situation and has fallen back on a completely do
                            nothing “impartiality”, although he realizes that this may be working in
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s favor. Although he
                            did not commit himself, he seemed interested in idea we put forth of
                            having some semblance of a caretaker government to be set up by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> as an interim
                            authority until such time as conditions would permit an orderly
                            convening of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Hammarskjold, however, refused, as will be noted, to make any commitment
                            as to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attitude towards any such
                            caretaker government because of constitutional problem involving
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. However, I believe if
                            we could produce some coherent plan to bring about establishment by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> of a caretaker
                            government, with possibly <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>
                            as Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> as
                            chief military authority subordinate to it, we would have basis for
                            further discussion with Hammarskjold.</p>
                        <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0583"/>
                        <p>As to letters to Belgium regarding Belgian technicians, we believe that
                            being unable to see clearly what can be done in regard to action in
                            Congo, he is taking this attitude in order to do something and in
                            particular to gain favor with African states. He spoke vaguely of
                            necessity for consultation as to disposition of these technicians and we
                            believe this matter should also be pursued further with him. Since [<hi
                                rend="italic">Although?</hi>] it is our impression that he can still
                            be influenced in more moderate action than his letters would imply, we
                            see, however, very little real hope in changing Hammarskjold’s present
                            attitude unless serious and constructive alternative in regard to
                            caretaker government can be worked out and discussed with him. Such govt
                            to have any chance of succeeding, should have different <gloss

                            to this effect might usefully be made to <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> at subsequent meeting with <gloss target="#t_SYG1"

                        <p>Bohlen’s reiteration at several different points in our conversation that

                            negative analysis, but did not seem have definite ideas where to go
                            next. At the least we feel he will be more receptive in future
                            discussion to specific proposals (a) for dealing with caretaker govt if
                            one can be devised, (b) shifting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            troops, and, if these two factors dealt with, (c) more stringent action

                            which <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> admitted. We inferred from

                            appreciates receipt your thoughtful report and suggestions following
                            your long conversation with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.
                            Situation in Congo continues to drift. We therefore request you follow
                            up soonest last conversation with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.
                            In our judgment it is essential that you continue take firm and
                            constructive approach with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. As
                            general framework to your discussion we suggest you include following
                            principal considerations:</p>
                        <p>US continues be seriously concerned with developments in Congo which, if
                            not checked soon, will inevitably lead to increasing deterioration and
                            chaos with disastrous consequences to free world community and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> position in Congo. We have noted, and
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is fully aware, that pressures
                            and concrete actions by <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Ghana and
                            Guinea, abetted by <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> who is
                            under instructions from <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, continue
                            unabated in direction of keeping <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> issue alive and otherwise making it more
                            difficult for <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, Commissioner Generals, et al.
                            to follow constructive course. We cannot stand idly by and permit
                            situation in Congo to retrogress so as to lead to serious increase in
                            Soviet influence in Congo, which in turn would have gravest
                            repercussions in terms of US support for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> generally and for Congo operations specifically.</p>
                        <p>Starting point of any constructive plan for Congo must be from assumption
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> is recognized
                            legally and otherwise as chief of state. On this there is full agreement
                            between <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and US. While Hammarskjold
                            does not agree with our view that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> is no longer Prime Minister, there is at least
                            some flexibility here since he has not and apparently does not intend to
                            deal with <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as Prime
                            Minister. These two basic factors offer some hope that we and <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> can take fresh look at situation and
                            move ahead in concert on constructive course of action.</p>
                        <p>Our objective is to encourage emergence reasonable, stable “non-aligned”
                            government (excluding <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>)
                            which on caretaker basis can begin to bring about order from chaos and
                            can get administrative <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0585"
                            />mechanism and ministries started on constructive tasks. It clear that
                            Ileo Government cannot do job. Moreover, while the College of
                            Commissioners have been useful in reactivating <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> operations, they have no legal claim to status as a
                            Government and so cannot long continue in present form. We believe that
                            conditions in Congo are such that it should be possible successfully to
                            encourage <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> to appoint new
                            caretaker government—perhaps under <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> or some other individual as Prime Minister. In
                            order for such plan to be feasible, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>, who in our judgment still retains good deal of
                            strength with <gloss target="#t_CNA1">CNA</gloss>, must be, for lack of
                            anyone with comparable strength, force which maintains caretaker
                            government. We believe he can be brought around to cooperating.</p>
                        <p>We have in mind ourselves going to <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> with view to suggesting appointment of new
                            caretaker government. In order for such plan to work satisfactorily, it
                            absolutely essential have at least <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            acquiescence both in <gloss target="#t_NY1">NY</gloss> and in Congo. We
                            believe that if <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> willing cooperate
                            with us on this fresh start he could provide necessary lead and
                            instructions to <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> which would
                            be helpful to all concerned on ground.</p>
                        <p>Our hope would be that new caretaker government would seek approval of
                            parliament as soon as circumstances are propitious.</p>
                        <p>In order for such proposal to work <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            force in Leopoldville would have to maintain strict impartiality. As
                            long as moderates in Leopoldville are unable express their views freely
                            for fear of assault by <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            henchmen no effort to seek constructive moderate regime which could work
                            confidently with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has chance of
                            success. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. While we do not wish to
                            suggest at this point what steps would be necessary by <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> with respect to activities of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Congo, some consideration will
                            undoubtedly have to be given to possibility of placing Tunisian and
                            possibly Nigerian troops along side Ghanaian and <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> troops in Leopoldville, and possibility of providing
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> with deputies who might
                            give more balance to leadership of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on
                            ground. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>While you should not seek <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s approval
                            of this approach which he may be reluctant to give, if Hammarskjold
                            indicated interest in working out arrangements along lines of above, you
                            should state that we will be prepared discuss with him details as to how
                            this can be achieved. We believe that with close cooperation between US
                            and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> such caretaker government can be
                            secured and in manner in which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            impartiality will be maintained.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Related Subject</hi> We note further reports re
                            possibility of good-offices commission being established and being sent
                            to Congo. We know <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is not keen on

                        <p>We replied we believed basic philosophies were not different and that we

                            acting on “principles” even though they “appeared” to be helping one

                        <p>He also expressed serious concern about <gloss target="#t_CNA1"

                                >UN</gloss> forces. This indicated to <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> that, like many similar actions in Congo, they had been
                            acting on impulse and lacked any clear plan of action. As matters stood,
                                <gloss target="#t_CNA1">CNA</gloss> forces would now remain outside

                            Thysville, by agreement between <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and

                            armored cars, could have seriously jeopardized <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> security in Leo while at same time, because of that
                            city’s isolation from rest of Congo, could not have brought about

                            beyond city. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said <gloss

                                >CNA</gloss> now based on agreement with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>, and that whenever there had been [was?] an

                            enforce it.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s comment on outside
                            forces in Congo, we reiterated we had strong evidence of outside
                            interference in Leo by Ghana, Guinea, <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> and recently Morocco designed support return to power
                            of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said Ghana was ringleader and said he
                            well aware of harmful activities by Welbeck. Barco said Cairo was
                            heavily involved. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> reiterated he
                            thought <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> was all right and Ghana was
                            in lead. As example he cited fact <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>
                            troops had been moved by barges down river to Leopoldville without
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> knowledge. This had been
                            discovered by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel when <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> units asked for too many rations.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he took this up with
                                Fawzi<note n="3" xml:id="d251fn3">
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi
                                was heading the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> Delegation to
                                the General Assembly.</note> who said they would straighten it out
                            immediately. Instructions were sent through Cairo and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> troops were withdrawn and replaced
                            under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> orders.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, as part of normal re-deployment of its forces, <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had decided some time ago to move
                            Ghanaian troops to Kasai. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he
                            had had long and difficult correspondence about this with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>, who was seeking to maintain his
                            own national control over Ghanaian troops, something SYG could not allow
                            to happen. Agreement had finally been reached with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> on transfer of Ghana troops from
                            Leo to Kasai Province, which Cordier remarked would start next week.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said they would be replaced by
                            Tunisian troops, as result of which he looked for improvement in
                            Leo.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> then called our attention to
                            reappearance of Ileo who was present and was introduced as “<gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>” when <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> talked several days ago with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>. <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> expressed himself strongly in favor of building
                            government which would be based on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>, as uncontested Chief of State, and would enjoy
                            at least some prospect of parliamentary approval. He thought Ileo was
                            person to start with as <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> of such
                            government. But there must be move toward “constitutionality”, with
                            reconvening of Parliament to approve government as stated goal.</p>
                        <p>He thought even Africans were now coming to realize that continued
                            absence of any effective government was playing into Belgian hands. He
                            cited examples of Belgian judges volunteering to set up court system
                            without any prospect of payment from either <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> or Congo; a move which to him clearly indicated Belgian
                            Government was providing financial guarantees in order reestablish their
                            influence throughout Congo. He stressed that there were two anchors of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> relations in Congo—<persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> as Chief of State, and
                            Parliament. A new government should be presented to Parliament, but both
                            he and <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> have insisted
                            parliamentary approval of any government must (a) be by full Parliament,
                            with all six provinces represented, and (b) be obtained absolutely free
                            of duress, under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> protection. (He said
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces would patrol area of
                            Parliament and assure protection to all concerned.)</p>
                        <p>Difficulty in convening Parliament until now had been Katanga but he
                            thought this situation had improved. This was evidenced by recent
                            lengthy note he reed from Tshombe<note n="4" xml:id="d251fn4">Dated

                                >SYG</gloss> thought tone of Tshombe’s response was evidence of

                            would be most helpful particularly if we could put some “fire” into
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, so long as we could
                            do it “delicately” and not “visibly” and so long as we “put nothing in
                            his pocket”. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said again he thought
                            Ileo, now that he <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0589"/>had
                            reappeared on the scene, was best bet as <gloss target="#t_PM1"
                                >PM</gloss>. He believes Ileo and <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> are both intelligent but latter lacks stability.
                            He felt <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> might remain as
                            Army Chief-of-Staff under Ileo. He said it would be highly desirable
                            that he be promptly informed of our approach to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> if we decide to make it but he
                            did not pick up our suggestion that he then give <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> appropriate instructions to
                            cooperate. Barco came back to issue several times in order to make sure
                            situation was clear. Result was (1) <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            agrees that US should approach <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> as long as we “keep our skirts from showing”;
                            (2) he feels step to be taken is to refurbish Ileo government, bring it
                            into active governmental activity; (3) he “apparently” had no objections
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> being in government,
                            although he wants Gen Kettani (Morocco) to assume de facto control of
                            Congolese army; (4) steps must be taken toward “constitutionality” of
                            new government, especially plans present it to Parliament must be
                            announced; (5) meeting of Parliament must be “full” and under <gloss

                                >UN</gloss> will cooperate with new active government (without
                            commitment as to quite how); (7) he wants us to keep him informed of
                            what we are doing; (8) he did not say <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> had to be in government (although he earlier

                        <p>At the 465th meeting of the National Security Council on October 31,
                            Acting Director of Central Intelligence General Charles P. Cabell
                            discussed developments in the Congo during his briefing on significant
                            world developments. The relevant portion of the memorandum of discussion
                            by Director of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Secretariat
                            Robert H. Johnson, November 2, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Turning finally to the Congo, General Cabell said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s position was improving.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> was openly hostile to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>. Most of the
                            Congolese Army troops were now outside Leopoldville. The governmental
                            commissioners and others in Leopoldville were hopeful that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> would be replaced by the
                            military commander at Thysville. General Cabell referred to the creation
                            of the 15 Nation Conciliation Commission on the 29th of October. He
                            stated that its large size and the inclusion in it of moderates would
                            hamper the all-out efforts of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s allies to use it to restore <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to power. The Congolese Army
                            could turn on <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> at any
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName>, the pro-<persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> vice-president, was tightening
                            his control over the pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>
                            police. General Cabell concluded by stating that the situation in the
                            interior of the Congo was threatening and described actual and potential
                            tribal outbreaks in the interior.” (Eisenhower Library, Whitman File,

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, as previously
                            reported, is impulsive, naive, but apparently honest and for the moment
                            at least in place as leading figure in Army. Probability of friction
                            between him, <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and future
                            Prime Minister cannot be ruled out but in circumstances believe risk
                            must be taken. See no unsurmountable difficulty in harmonizing our and
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s view.</p>
                        <p>2. Do not consider Ileo best Prime Minister as he lacks necessary drive
                            and flair. Believe Adoula,<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Cyrille Adoula, a

                            able but bears pro-Belgian tag and considered weak by many.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, despite his
                            weaknesses, should be member inner council new government with primary
                            responsibility for Army and stability. To accomplish this he will have
                            to be persuaded to take less public role and agree to coordination on
                            basic policy in which he will play part.</p>
                        <p>4. Getting full Parliament assembled will depend on Tshombe and as I read
                            Elisabethville’s telegrams he seems further away than ever. Believe it
                            would require strong pressure from a number of sources, including
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> to persuade him to
                            participate. It will require great deal planning and should not be
                            encouraged before end December unless a sure majority is on deck. (This
                            also <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>’s own
                            position.)</p>

                            for him. However, believe <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>
                            basically wants Parliament-supported government with which he can

                            would have to be allowed to participate in session of Parliament as

                            guidance, it is clear that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is left
                            with wide discretion in actual operations while member states have
                            considerable latitude in interpreting, as they choose, actions in Congo
                            as supporting or violating such resolutions. Great majority of states
                            seem to have supported faithfully <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            actions in hope law and order will be restored and economy put back in
                            shape without impairing independence of Congo. A highly active and vocal
                            minority has, however, sought to influence <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action in service their several national interests,
                            which coincide for the moment at least in Congo, making arguments on
                            high principles of resolutions. The ensuing clamor seems to have
                            obscured the issues as well as the facts for many member states not
                            intimately concerned or informed.</p>
                        <p>Even most sympathetic observers know this country cannot govern itself in
                            any intelligent fashion and that, left to its own devices and without
                            outside aid, could not survive as a national entity. Certainly, modern
                            economy bequeathed by Belgium would very quickly disintegrate entirely.
                            The Belgians know this better than any others and their pre-independence
                            plans did not envisage present situation. They have had shocking
                            traumatic experience from which they will not soon recover. In spite of
                            strong currents favoring other policies, Belgian policy seems to support
                            general <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aims in Congo while hoping,
                            through encouraging return of key technicians, to repair some of the
                            damage done and keep the Congo above water. I do not believe Belgian
                            policy involves, even remotely, effort reimpose colonial status <pb
                                n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0593"/>on Congo as some critics claim.
                            It does include, naturally, effort to conserve huge investment here.
                            Very fact that investment here almost exclusively Belgian and
                            monopolistic as well, colors attitude many nations and leaves Belgium
                            open to attack on grounds economic, if not political, imperialism.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet bloc seeks entry, on almost any terms, into central Africa for
                            well-known purposes. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> seeks
                            expand personal leadership of African bloc by adding Congo. Sekou Toure
                            has same objective with added ingredient of active disaffection for
                            “colonialists” as result French policy there. Morocco governed more by
                            payment due Ghana for support on Mauritania than by real persuasion on
                            merits. <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> seems driven by general
                            anti-western policy and desire preserve access to bloc aid by serving

                            direct object their affections. These countries can and do have,
                            therefore, a positive policy line which they have consistently followed
                            and they have exploited every possible avenue which this chartless
                            situation has offered to advance toward the goal of restoring <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to power.</p>
                        <p>The majority of states, which want to help the Congo without
                            consideration of what they can gain individually, seem to be groupable:
                            (1) Those which understand and fear Soviet entry into Africa and will
                            work against it and (2) those remote, only vaguely informed and not
                            particularly interested in the problem. Group (1) needs the facts and
                            discreet guidance. Group (2) must be persuaded re importance and urgency
                            and educated.</p>
                        <p>Even assuming reasonable success in achieving interested and unselfish
                            majority, there is no simple solution to the problem of what should be
                            done about the Congo. Individual trusteeship is impossible; <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship untenable. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aid, scrupulous and patient as it has
                            been in staying out of internal affairs, has been attacked as
                            interfering by practically every politician of every stripe. As a matter
                            of fact the very nature of the problem is such that it is impossible for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to be here at all without
                            affecting internal affairs. If it did literally nothing, its mass and
                            inertia would have at least negative effect. Therefore question is and
                            has been how can <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objectives be
                            achieved with least harmful effect on internal affairs?</p>
                        <p>Idealistically, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> hopes for
                            democratically approved, relatively stable government with which it can
                            deal with some confidence and which has international respectability
                            according to democratic standards. I do not, unfortunately, see such
                            government emerging for very <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0594"
                            />long time. <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> is best bet
                            for strong central leadership but he is himself unstable and attitudes
                            provincial leaders and people (who are really tribal and not even
                            provincial) have so crystalized against him that any sort of unity would
                            have to be enforced, internally or by external means. Internal force (by
                                <gloss target="#t_CNA1">CNA</gloss>) would restart civil war.
                            External force (by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) would compromise
                            every principle of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and violate
                            terms existing Congo resolutions. Department can judge whether new

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> might very well emerge
                            with stamp of parliamentary approval but it would be compound of
                            cupidity (bought votes), intimidation (not just in halls of parliament,
                            which is least of our worries) and demagogic oratory, admitting to some
                            votes from genuine supporters. We would be back to early August
                            politically with even more dismal prospects for preserving unity of
                            Congo.</p>
                        <p>Fact is Congo is years away from more than facade of democracy. I do not
                            believe there is one single Congolese who has more than theoretical idea
                            of even the most elementary principles of democracy. They obviously
                            cannot practice something they do not understand. This does not insult
                            the many well-intentioned Congolese but does discount their ability
                            produce anything resembling democratic government until they have been
                            taught. Furthermore, I do not believe democracy can be imposed upon any
                            people overnight any more than it can be injected by hypodermic.
                            Therefore I do not share <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> enthusiasm
                            for accelerated parliamentary solution in Congo. Fact is such solution
                            would be simple decision to support <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> or not. There is no real positive alternative
                            which would engage parliamentary attention.</p>
                        <p>If foregoing analysis accepted, then our policy should be definitely
                            against restoration <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as bad
                            for Congo, bad for US and bad for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We
                            continue believe that outlook for real leadership coming from moderate

                            experience with ineptitude of commissioners and impotence of <persName

                            forces. Return of Belgian advisers, some of whom might have stupidly

                            some sensitive <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> feathers and raised
                            bogey of return of Belgium to position of major influence under cover of

                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> has any hopes for positive

                            will get unholy alliance off his neck, give <gloss target="#t_UNOC1"
                                >UNOC</gloss> acceptable government with which to work and even

                                >Lumumba</persName> acknowledged centralist and unitarian. While
                            semblance of logic might sell this line to the simple and uninformed, I
                            am satisfied such policy will blow up in <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            combinations seem less impossible than others and we believe should be

                            but differ with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on timing because we
                            feel now would be too soon to ensure honest and threat-free vote. If
                                <gloss target="#t_CNA1">CNA</gloss> disarmed, that possibility will
                            suffer serious setback. Furthermore, see no likelihood of Katanga
                            Deputies returning with or without <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            guarantee as long as they remain unconvinced that Lumumba can be beaten
                            in Parliament and as long as they feel <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            policy is pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and
                            anti-Katanga.</p>
                        <p>We believe peaceful solution must be sought by convincing provincial
                            leaders and parliamentarians opposing Lumumba that they must agree on a
                            government which they will actively support and line up enough firmly
                            pledged votes to have confidence in result when issue put before
                            Parliament. In this country where clocks are toys this cannot be done
                            overnight and morning isn’t here yet. If the time element is ignored and
                            birth induced now, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will probably
                            have an abortion on its plate.</p>
                        <p>Every time I look at this truly discouraging mess, I shudder over the
                            painfully slow, frustrating and costly job ahead for the <gloss

                                >SYG</gloss> report, Department believes there are two possible ways
                            for US to react.</p>
                        <p>First, for US to make sharp attack on report seeking to diminish its
                            credibility. We believe this not feasible for following principal
                            reason: while <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> obviously
                            prejudiced and has used intemperate and overdrawn language, all-out
                            attack on report would represent break with <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which would play
                            fully into hands of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            pro-Lumumbaists.</p>
                        <p>Second, for US to accommodate itself to report by putting as good face on
                            it as possible, emphasizing points supporting our own approach to Congo
                            problem and taking constructive line in noting shortcomings of report.
                            We believe this approach is only feasible way to deal with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> report which obviously puts US in
                            difficult position, primarily because of its strong attack on Belgian
                            activities in Congo. There are elements in report which provide basis
                            for US to take this approach. The emphasis given to Chief of State and
                            Parliament as two institutions through which peaceful solution can be
                            developed; the continued expressed intention of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> bring about stability, order and peaceful political
                            evolution in Congo.</p>
                        <p>Most difficult aspect of report relates question Belgian technicians. For
                            guidance this aspect see transcript Dept statement Nov 4<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d255fn2">It stated that the Department had every confidence
                                in Belgium’s good faith in its desire to be of assistance in the

                                contrary in the report. (<hi rend="italic">New York Times,</hi>

                        <p>We believe there is advantage, pending more concrete indications of how
                            Soviets and pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> Africans
                            intend to play this, for US adopt wait and see approach at outset of
                            debate. Since <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> report does emphasize
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> position as legal
                            chief of state, we hope it will prove possible to get clear-cut decision
                            seat his representative. While Soviets will undoubtedly seek to make
                            Belgians main scapegoat for situation in Congo, from US point of view,
                            if we have adequate support, credentials question is politically sound
                            issue for us to press. <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0597"/>Would
                            help reduce focus on Belgians and, if successfully carried forward,

                            objectives in Congo.</p>
                        <p>Point should also be noted that report on Congo is by <gloss

                            newspapermen into discussing details situation in Congo. If necessary,
                            he should inform press that he will discuss these problems at the <gloss

                        <p>(3) He should be thoroughly prepared discuss various aspects fundamental
                            law in <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. His presence and arguments
                            should tip scales in his favor regarding seating his delegation and

                        <p>DEAR CHRIS: From reports available to us it appears that, in his 21
                            October conversation with Secretary General Hammarskjold,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d259fn1">See <ref target="#d249">Document 249</ref>.</note>
                            Ambassador Bohlen made a forcefully clear presentation of the United
                            States position on the present situation in the Congo. Defense is in
                            complete agreement with the conclusions reached by Ambassador Bohlen as
                            a result of this conference. Additionally, we concur with the three
                            courses of action which the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations
                            suggests be taken within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            framework.</p>
                        <p>We are concerned, however, because the reasons offered by the Secretary
                            General for the present inactivity of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> in a rapidly deteriorating situation in the Congo ignore
                            the pressing requirement for immediate restoration of law and order. The
                            prestige of the United Nations itself is deeply involved in successful
                            solution of the Congo problem. In view of this and the interest shown by
                            Secretary General Hammarskjold in definite ideas about “where to go
                            next”, Defense believes that the United States should take full
                            advantage of this opportunity to influence <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> actions and regain the initiative.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I am enclosing a list of recommended courses of action which
                            Defense believes will assist us toward our common goal of:</p>
                        <p>a. Establishment of law and order in the Congo and creation of stable
                            conditions for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operations; and</p>
                        <p>b. Establishment of a legally recognized and responsible Congolese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Because of the initial momentum achieved by Ambassador Bohlen and the
                            instability within the Congo, I hope that these courses of action will

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> opened the
                            conversation saying that in view of our common interests in the Congo he
                            would like to present the Belgian viewpoint on the present situation.
                            Initially, he said, he wished to express thanks for the recent statement
                            which the United States had made, with regard to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> report, supporting the Belgian
                                position.<note n="1" xml:id="d260fn1">See <ref target="#d255fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 255</ref>.</note> He said this statement
                            had ended the feeling of isolation which the Belgians had felt
                            previously. He thought the strong position which we had taken on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> report and on the
                            Hammarskjold notes with regard to Belgian technicians had been very
                            helpful and had materially changed the situation in New York. He said
                            that in particular the fact we had let our position be known had been
                            useful to the Belgians. He also expressed appreciation at the
                            willingness of the U.S. delegation in New York to meet with the group of
                            interested Western delegations almost on a day-to-day basis.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then passed
                            to a discussion of Belgium’s difficulties with the Secretary General. He
                            said the Belgian Government believed and recognized the fact that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should remain in the Congo for a
                            long time. Nevertheless, Belgium also thought there was a role for
                            Belgians in the Congo as well, both in the private sector and in the
                            supplying of technicians. There should be at least coexistence and
                            preferably cooperation between the United Nations and Belgium in the
                            Congo. Belgium certainly does not want to reoccupy the Congo and her
                            initial action in sending security forces at the time of outbreaks in
                            July was only to protect Western interests. As soon as <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces had arrived, Belgian forces had
                            been withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> continued by
                            saying that now the Secretary General had undertaken a series of unwise
                            actions. He noted the expressed desire of the Secretary General to crush
                            Mr. Tshombe. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said that Belgian policy was that Katanga was <pb
                                n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0605"/>only temporarily a separate
                            entity. He said that Hammarskjold, however, had the foolish idea that
                            the first step in the Leopoldville struggle should be to get Tshombe on
                            his knees and then to recreate a group of leaders of a united Congo
                            through the parliamentary process. He said he thought this was
                            unrealistic, although in the long run Belgium, of course, hoped that all
                            Congo elements would effectively get together and approve a new
                            fundamental law. However, it seemed unwise to remove Tshombe at such a
                            time as the security situation was worse everywhere else in the Congo
                            than in the domain which he controls. Although Hammarskjold had not
                            written down his views on these points, <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> continued, he had made them clear and had repeated
                            them again yesterday to him in New York. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> went on to say that there should
                            be created a new unity in the Congo including Katanga, but that this
                            needed the cooperation of the Katanga authorities, including Tshombe, as
                            well as the more sensible elements in Leopoldville. Although the
                            Secretary General said he was not a supporter of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, he seemed to envisage his
                            return to power. Reconvening Parliament as <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> desired would play into the latter’s hands and
                            would probably lead to his restoration to power because of his ability
                            to convince and frighten the Parliamentarians. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> indicated that the
                            Belgians thought that some satisfactory group of leaders should be
                            settled on first with Parliament convened at a later date to approve
                            them. He thought that to ask Parliament itself to select the leaders
                            would almost inevitably lead to the return of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had been interested by the views of Sendwe in favor
                            of a loose confederation including a central government and strong
                            provincial governments. Under the Sendwe plan the central government
                            would handle foreign affairs, defense, financial and communications
                            problems. Furthermore, Katanga revenues would be turned over to the
                            central government in the amount of one-third while Katanga would keep
                            two-thirds of its revenues for itself. He thought that this seemed like
                            a moderate proposal and therefore was somewhat encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The Belgian Foreign Minister said that he thought the situation of
                            centralization versus decentralization should be left fairly fluid and
                            that it should simply be stated that the different interested elements
                            in all parts of the Congo including Katanga were working together in a
                            brotherly way. At the same time stress should be put on the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> was the one who was
                            dividing the Congo. Unity should be achieved in Leopoldville first and
                            then an arrangement for decentralization worked out including the
                            Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then passed
                            to the question of Belgian technicians and said that the Secretary
                            General was asking for their removal but that it was somewhat hard to
                            follow him. The Belgians <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0606"/>were
                            not entirely clear as to what he wanted, whether or not it was to
                            eliminate the Belgian element in the Congo entirely. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said that on some
                            occasions Mr. Hammarskjold seemed to envisage only the departure of
                            certain categories of Belgian civil servants but that at other times he
                            seemed to want to do away with the Belgian presence entirely.
                            Hammarskjold had asked that Belgian bilateral assistance should stop and
                            should be channeled through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> was
                            exercised at an article appearing in the US press that morning to the
                            effect that <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss> was seeking 500
                            French-speaking but non-Belgian teachers for the Congo. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> pointed out that even if
                            500 French-speaking teachers could be found, it would not be possible to
                            find ones who understood the local political situation and spoke the
                            local languages. He thought only the Belgians would fulfill such a
                            requirement. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said he was aware of Hammarskjold’s rationale that
                            if Belgian bilateral assistance were permitted this would establish a
                            precedent for Soviet bilateral aid in the event of the return of
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. The Foreign Minister
                            then pointed out that the Belgians involved in the Congo were not
                            Belgian Government civil servants but were employed by the Congolese
                            Government which has requested their return often by name. He added that
                            it was not only Tshombe but authorities in Leopoldville and other
                            provincial capitals who had requested these technicians, who now
                            numbered about 2100. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said seven hundred of these were teachers, three
                            hundred were with OTRACO<note n="2" xml:id="d260fn2">A parastatal
                                transportation organization.</note> and five hundred with Sabena.
                            Only a third of the total were in the Katanga. The Secretary asked if it
                            were true that the Belgian Government paid one-third of these salaries
                            while two-thirds was paid by the local authorities. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said that this was
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then
                            proceeded to criticize Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>,
                            saying that he was unfair to the Belgians on the technician problem and
                            that the Congolese wanted them present. The Foreign Minister added that
                            the Belgians were not undertaking any new bilateral programs but simply
                            carrying out agreements which had been reached before independence.
                            Therefore, this did not establish a precedent for an eventual Soviet
                            presence since the Belgian agreements were a factor of independence. The
                            Foreign Minister then declared that if Belgium had had an additional
                            fifteen years in the Congo it would have been the best prepared country
                            in Africa for independence. The base of the pyramid of people who had
                            been trained was large, but there simply had not been time to build up a
                            sufficient group of upper-level personnel. There were more Congolese in
                            secondary institutions, for example, than there were Nigerians. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could not find the proper <pb
                                n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0607"/>people to fill technical jobs
                            in the Congo but wanted to displace Belgians. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said he wondered if the Secretary
                            General, in fact, wished to establish a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> trusteeship over the Congo. He thought this would be a
                            dangerous precedent for Africans generally. He also referred to the
                            Secretary General’s letter to Tshombe which he criticized and added that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> would certainly bring
                            back Soviet technicians on a bilateral basis should he attain power
                            again.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired regarding the Foreign Minister’s talk with
                            Hammarskjold and <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> in New York
                            the previous day. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said that the Secretary General had been courteous
                            but had maintained all of his positions, which the Belgians thought were
                            unwise. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>
                            said he thought that Hammarskjold had been very much affected by the
                            attack which <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had made
                            on him and felt that he must at all costs have Afro-Asian support even
                            if the Afro-Asians should decide they wanted <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s return to power. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> stated he thought Hammarskjold was
                            forgetting that he might be damaging the future of the Congo and also
                            acting to the detriment of the West as a whole. He noted that the money
                            for the Congo rescue operation was coming entirely from the West. He
                            said Belgium wanted to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> since both Belgium and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> are in fact present in the Congo. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was making it difficult for there to be
                            genuine cooperation and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> policy seemed
                            to be to eliminate Belgium from the picture entirely. He stressed that
                            some settlement must be found but said that the present conditions of
                            the Secretary General were unacceptable. He referred again to Belgian
                            displeasure with the remarks of Bunche in a magazine article and Cordier
                            in a T.V. interview.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Rothschild referred again to remarks attributed to
                            Hammarskjold to the effect that Tshombe must be removed and that the
                            Belgian presence in the Katanga should be eliminated because it was the
                            prop without which Tshombe could not continue to exist. Rothschild added
                            that the Secretary General seemed to have the mistaken idea that
                            Congolese unity would be achieved by the collapse of the present Katanga
                            administration. The Secretary noted that it was somewhat difficult to
                            envisage what would happen if Tshombe were to disappear and who would
                            replace him. Mr. Bohlen said that Hammarskjold thought Tshombe was an
                            obstacle to Congolese unity and that he would fall if Belgian support
                            were removed. Therefore, according to the Secretary General’s reasoning,
                            this Belgian help should be withdrawn. The Secretary General, according
                            to Mr. Bohlen, also felt that there was strong opposition to Tshombe in
                            Katanga and that there were numerous <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> followers there. However, he said, the Secretary
                            General was not entirely clear on these points. Mr. Bohlen <pb n="578"
                                xml:id="pg_578" facs="0608"/>stressed that Hammarskjold was not
                            consciously planning the return of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> though he admitted this might well be the result
                            of the policy which he espoused.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> did
                            not seem to be too well informed on the plotting which was going on in
                            Leopoldville and which was anti-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in
                            nature. He thought there was danger of merely creating additional
                            chaos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> if
                            he was planning further talks with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>
                            indicated that he was sending Foreign Office Secretary General Van Den
                            Bosch, who knew Hammarskjold, to New York to hold further discussions.
                            However, he thought that the November 10 discussion which he had had
                            with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> had been on the whole
                            discouraging. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must
                            be pushed hard to effect a compromise with the Belgians since both were
                            necessary to the Congo. He added that Hammarskjold was playing the
                            African game, but that the Congolese should have freedom to select
                            technicians as they desire. This was not a Belgian reoccupation. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> indicated he would
                            send to the Secretary details regarding the number and type of Belgian
                            technicians who are now present in the Congo. He referred to the fact
                            that the courts cannot function at the present time because of the
                            absence of Belgian judges and that various Congolese provincial
                            governments had requested the return of such officials. The Secretary
                            referred to the need for Belgian judges and lawyers and wondered how the
                            Congo could operate without them, how courts could operate, how warrants
                            would be written, etc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> appeared to differentiate between
                            various categories of Belgians in the Congo. The two categories to which
                            he objected as near as the Belgians could tell were: 1) army officers
                            and 2) “policy makers”. The officers, <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said, were public servants hired by the Congolese
                            prior to independence. He noted the contrast between the peaceful
                            conditions existing in the rest of the Katanga where there were Belgians
                            and the chaos now existing in the northern portion of the province where
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was present. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> also stated that there would be a
                            bad reaction among the large and important Belgian colony in
                            Elisabethville if Belgian officers were to depart.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> went on to say that
                            Hammarskjold was also wrong in his feeling about the so-called “policy
                            makers” among Belgian technicians and said these were simply advisers to
                            the Commissioners. When anything went wrong, he said, the Belgians were
                            blamed, but these men were not operating as Belgian government
                            functionaries. Rather, the Congolese felt the need of them and had asked
                            for them. Hammarskjold had asked that they be refused Belgian passports
                            but this was not possible for the Belgian government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then said he had suggested that
                            there should be personal contact in Leopoldville between <pb n="579"
                                xml:id="pg_579" facs="0609"/>a Belgian liaison officer and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> there. He said, however, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> appeared to treasure his troubles
                            and did not want to take steps to iron them out; rather, he would prefer
                            to use a big stick against the Belgians. The Secretary inquired whether,
                            since the Belgian Government was paying one-third of the salaries of
                            these people, it could recall them. Ambassador Rothschild said that
                            these were mostly former colonial officials which had been selected by
                            name by the Congolese. They go under the terms of the agreements reached
                            between Belgium and the Congo before independence. The Belgian
                            contribution is for the upkeep of the families of these people in
                            Belgium. The Secretary thought that it might be useful to go over
                            problems involving Belgian functionaries on a case by case basis and
                            perhaps recall trouble-makers who might be found. Ambassador Rothschild
                            said that the Belgians had proposed a liaison officer in Leopoldville
                            who could be in touch with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and use
                            his influence with the Congolese and keep Belgian functionaries in line.
                            However, he said, Hammarskjold had rejected this idea. He concluded that
                            ultimately the Belgian Government could recall these functionaries but
                            that this would be highly undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bohlen then said it might be possible for the Belgians to discuss the
                            problem of their technicians with Mr. Hammarskjold on a basis of
                            different categories, such as para-military technicians, teachers, etc.
                            He said that Hammarskjold had been vague with him some weeks ago when
                            they had discussed this problem as to exactly what technicians he
                            thought should go. It seemed to Mr. Bohlen that he did not mean that all
                            of them should depart but that only some of them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired into the Belgian attitude on the 15-man
                            commission. Mr. Bohlen said that this group was still in New York and
                            that there was some difficulty about its terms of reference. Mr. Bohlen
                            did not think it would go for a couple of weeks. He thought it was
                            important that there be some moderate African representation thereon,
                            and added that Hammarskjold was not keen about it. Mr. Bohlen said that
                            Hammarskjold was well aware of our views on all of these problems and we
                            would continue to talk with him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed with the Belgian point to the effect that the West
                            was paying the bill for this operation and that the Afro-Asians were
                            trying to direct it. He did not approve of the idea of placing only
                            Africans on the 15-man commission and eliminating countries such as
                            Ireland which is also participating with forces in the Congo. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said that he was afraid the 15-man
                            commission would take certain decisions and that perhaps these would be
                            adverse to the West. He admitted that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had not presented his viewpoint effectively to
                            the other Africans in New York. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said that he had also thought perhaps it could be
                            suggested to <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> that he
                            might invite a group of friendly African Chiefs of State to Leopoldville
                            in order <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0610"/>to counter-balance the
                            15-man group. Perhaps all Chiefs of State of countries south of the
                            Sahara could be invited, as this would lead to the presence of, on the
                            whole, a moderate group. The Secretary inquired if it were the Belgian
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> should
                            initiate such an invitation. <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName>
                            replied in the affirmative and Ambassador Rothschild added that the
                            15-man group would undoubtedly favor <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>. Mr. Bohlen said that not all of them would
                            favor <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> but admitted that
                            the dominating ones probably would, although perhaps this was not a
                            numerical majority. Rothschild added that the Belgian thought was that
                            this would be a parallel operation to the dispatch of the 15-man group
                            and that it would not be an operation mounted through the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but rather by direct invitations to the
                            countries involved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought that it would be a good idea to seat the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> delegation first or otherwise
                            it risked adding to the confusion. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> agreed. The Secretary said he was disturbed by the
                            strong racial element involved and the exclusion of Sweden, Ireland and
                            Canada from the 15-man group although these countries were also
                            participating in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation.
                            Furthermore, countries like ours which were providing the money for this
                            operation were also worried about the “stacked" nature of the
                            commission. He thought that Malaya might be helpful but that Indonesia
                            would not be so good.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Rothschild added that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> was personally opposed to this commission. The
                            Secretary said that unfortunately <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> had not made a particularly good impression in
                            New York<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">In an address to the General

                                by himself and requested that they be seated immediately; for text
                                see U.N. doc. A/PV.912.</note> and had not been very forceful. Mr.
                            Bohlen pointed out that Kasavubu was of course the one person on whose
                            status there was universal agreement. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wigny</persName> said it was therefore important to seat him and
                            his delegation in New York. Mr Bohlen noted that the Credentials
                            Committee had reported favorably by a six-to-one vote.<note n="4"

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> then
                            returned to the problem of Belgian teachers in the Congo and referred
                            again to the press report that <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>
                            was seeking five hundred French-speaking teachers but excluding
                            Belgians. The Secretary said he had not been under the impression that
                            Hammarskjold was particularly concerned about Belgian teachers, but
                            rather by Belgian officers in the cabinets of the Congolese
                            Commissioners. Therefore he thought the suggestion of the Belgians
                            studying with Hammarskjold the different categories of Belgians involved
                                <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0611"/>would be helpful. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> repeated his desire to be
                            cooperative with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in the Congo, but
                            noted that of course Belgium has no Ambassador in Leopoldville and that
                            his suggestion for a liaison arrangement had been turned down. He said
                            that Belgium would continue to have a role in the Congo if only because
                            of the private sector.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would be glad to have the figures regarding Belgian
                            technicians. Mr. Bohlen asked if this problem would be discussed further
                            by <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> with Hammarskjold.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> said he did not believe
                            so but that he would send Van Den Bosch to New York to follow up on the
                            previous talk. The Secretary said he thought this would be a good idea
                            and that further exploratory talks would be useful. The meeting closed
                            with a further reference to the credentials situation in New York with
                                <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wigny</persName> saying he thought it
                            would be helpful to have the plenary on seating the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> delegation as soon as possible.
                            Mr. Bohlen said we would push forward, but of course we did not know yet
                            how the voting situation looked for the plenary. It was agreed that the
                            Belgians certainly would not take any leading role on this problem
                            either publicly or even privately. There was then a brief reference to
                            the postponement of the Congo debate and Mr. Bohlen said he believed
                            that the official who had been in the chair at the time had not followed
                            the proper rules of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedure.<note

                            Before I discussed with Tshombe on November 10 points raised in
                            reference telegram, Tshombe’s Cabinet <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582"
                                facs="0612"/>Director showed me instructions which Tshombe was about
                            to send Evariste Kimba by teletype. These instructions authorized Kimba
                            to join <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s <gloss
                                target="#t_UNDel1">UNDel</gloss> provided prior discussions between
                            Kimba and <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> resulted in
                            agreement by Central Government to recognize independence, or at least
                            application for autonomy, of Katanga. After speaking to Tshombe as
                            instructed, latter told me of his instructions to Kimba. I pointed to
                            apparent similarity between Tshombe’s viewpoint and that expressed in my
                            instructions and suggested only that instructions to Kimba seemed likely
                            to lead to lengthy negotiations in New York with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> on exact character of future ties between
                            Katanga and Congo. I suggested therefore that question of exact
                            relationship be left open and Katanga’s position on this reserved.</p>
                        <p>At this point Tshombe, who appeared haggard and tired, launched into
                            lengthy, querulous and somewhat irrelevant discussion of US attitudes
                            toward Katanga. He said that suggestion I had just made concerning his
                            willingness to support <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            while reserving his position regarding future relationships appeared to
                            him to be an attempt by US and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> to entrap Katanga into returning as part of
                            Congo Republic. He criticized <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for
                            lack of consideration for Katanga and overemphasis on unity of Congo. I
                            answered by saying that, if <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s delegation were seated by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, Katanga could indeed be fearful of its
                            future as an autonomous area. However, I did not believe that Tshombe
                            honestly thought that a <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            victory would lead to subjugation of Katanga by Central Government, by
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or by <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>. Tshombe then asked why <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> continues to refuse to recognize Katanga as separate
                            state, if not because US intends that Katanga eventually lose its
                            national identity. I replied that our lack of recognition to date was
                            due to fact that peoples of all sections of former Belgian Congo have
                            not yet had opportunity, given continual disruptions of past months, to
                            decide future relationships among and between each other and that
                            pending this US does not wish to prejudice outcome. I referred to
                            Tshombe’s repeated statements of his willingness to contract ties of
                            association with other areas of former Belgian Congo and said it
                            appeared logical not to proceed toward future association by beginning
                            with total divorce. Tshombe’s reply was that this was purely occidental
                            approach to political problems and that US was mistaken in not allowing
                            Congolese peoples to work out their own relationships.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>Following discussion in which I underlined difficulties inherent in
                            forming associations between states totally independent of each other,
                            Tshombe returned to what he described as lack of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> regard for Katanga due mainly to fact Katanga has not
                            attempted blackmail of Western Governments through appeals for Communist
                            assistance. He said he greatly disturbed over <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> failure to accept repeated invitations for official US
                            participation in Elisabethville International Fair next July. I said
                            lack of acceptance to date did not mean that reply would necessarily be
                            negative and that I foresaw possibility of US participation in
                            exposition. Tshombe said somewhat bitterly that Communist countries have
                            already reserved space and he imagined this would be only reason for
                            eventual participation by Western Governments.</p>
                        <p>Tshombe made final point that attitude of <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> toward Katanga has given him heart condition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Tshombe, who according to reliable
                            sources suffers from insomnia and excessive worry, was obviously haunted
                            by fear on this occasion—fear that this support of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> would signal eventual
                            absorption of Katanga by Central Government and fear on other hand that
                            his failure to support <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            might mean return of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> to
                            power. I assume he sent instructions to Kimba in line with those already
                            prepared prior my visit.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Tshombe’s attitude toward US, it apparent he
                            increasingly victim of advisors who attempt to turn him against US. This
                            and previous moment of anti-US feeling on Tshombe’s part have coincided
                            with attempts by American companies to obtain economic positions in
                            Katanga, most recent effort being that by Seven Seas Airlines to obtain
                            air freedoms here. Katangan officials initially welcomed approaches by
                            American companies and admit they desirous of breaking Belgian
                            monopolies in Katanga. However, doubtless under pressure from private
                            Belgian advisors, they characteristically accompany their
                            reconsideration of private American requests with anti-American
                            political posture.</p>
                        <p>I believe success of those advising anti-American line due less to lack
                            of US recognition of Katanga, reasons for which are well understood,
                            than to failure of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to extend minor
                            courtesies toward Katanga Government which would have far-reaching

                            <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> is the key for the
                            present even though I could wish he were more able and less impulsive.
                            He has announced timetable December 31 for completion work Commissioners
                            as such. We feel it will take at least until then for provincial leaders
                            get together to obtain necessary atmosphere for peaceful political
                            activity (i.e. Stanleyville) and prepare to get parliamentary support
                            for a new formula. Problem especially difficult for Tshombe and only
                            slightly less so for Kalonji.</p>
                        <p>I question therefore (A) whether dissolution Commissioners would be
                            acceptable <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> and other key
                            figures before end December, (B) whether fallback to Ileo government
                            (never, incidentally, dismissed) or some reshuffle in cabinet would
                            really get us further forward. Fact is Commissioners have been much more
                            constructive and productive than either preceding government even though
                                <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> disparages them. I hope they
                            will be retained in some appropriate capacity in eventual
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we have distinct impression <gloss target="#t_UNOC1"
                                >UNOC</gloss> policy is directed toward solution which would, in our
                            opinion, lead to restoration <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> to power if implemented before opposition can
                            organize itself. Unless such policy changes, I have feeling any new or
                            revived cabinet formula would be equally distrustful to <gloss
                                target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> and no less subject attack by unholy
                            alliance. If, on other hand, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>3. Agree but problem not simple and very little confidence should be
                            placed in durability or even accuracy our head count. We know very large

                            a very real risk that Parliament will vote by pocket rather than by

                            Lines should be that necessary and effective groundwork must be laid

                            participate and all parliamentarians must be free to express
                            opinions.</p>

                            procedural vote may be close and we hope respective dels will be
                            instructed vote against any (there are various possibilities, such as
                            simple adjournment of <gloss target="#t_mtg1">mtg</gloss>, adjournment

                            abstain) on these theoretically procedural votes. Postponement motion or
                            motions will be in fact the most substantive issue before <gloss

                            is key substantive vote. If we do not win it, we will not get to

                            all possible votes to be sure of winning it. Once we defeat postponement

                            to follow as consequence (e.g., when postponement motions failed in

                        <p>On November 18, the U.N. General Assembly took up the report of the
                            Credentials Committee (U.N. doc. A/4578), which recommended the seating
                            of the delegation appointed by President <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>. Ghana’s Representative moved for adjournment
                            of debate on the report on the ground that discussion before the
                            Conciliation Commission completed its work would be undesirable. The
                            motion was rejected by a vote of 51 to 36, with 11 abstentions. For the
                            record of the meeting, see U.N. doc. A/PV.917.</p>
                        <p>The Assembly considered the Committee’s report at seven plenary meetings
                            between November 18 and 22. At the first session on November 22, the
                            Assembly rejected a motion by Ghana to adjourn debate on the report by a
                            vote of 50 to 34, with 13 abstentions, and a similar motion by Mali by a
                            vote of 47 to 32, with 16 abstentions. At the second session that day, a
                            Guinean proposal to postpone decision on the Credentials Committee’s
                            draft resolution was defeated by 50 votes to 32, with 14 abstentions.
                            The draft resolution was then adopted by a vote of 53 to 24, with 19
                            abstentions, as Resolution 1498 (XV). For the records of the November 22

                            security for moderates in Congo. Without such conditions, it would not
                            be possible to move ahead to putting Congolese Government on more firm
                            footing.</p>
                        <p>3) If, but only if, Hammarskjold requests US views, you may confirm US

                        <p>4) Re problem of Belgian technicians, US continues be impressed with
                            tremendous gap between requirements for services and ability to meet
                            these which exist almost across board in Congo. We see no reasonable
                            prospect for meeting most of these needs without significant role being
                            played by Belgian technical and other personnel for some time to come.
                            Nevertheless, we recognize that there are Belgian nationals in Congo who
                            are “soldiers of fortune" types, e.g. in Katanga and Kasai, and others
                            who are advancing their personal interests and acting in ways contrary
                            to program which United Nations is trying to pursue in Congo. We think
                            important step to be taken at this stage is for Secretary-General to
                            enter into full and frank discussions with Belgians on full range of
                            these problems. We understand that Belgians are prepared to send
                            high-ranking Belgian official from Brussels and would hope that
                            consultations between him and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could
                            shortly be undertaken. Highly pragmatic approach to problem is probably
                            most productive, i.e., examination of problem areas by categories or if
                            necessary on case-by-case basis. We have constantly counseled Belgium to
                            work closely with Secretary-General and will continue to attempt to
                            secure their close cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            We prepared to encourage Belgians to exercise more effective control
                            over their nationals in Congo. We believe that this whole problem stands
                            better chance of being resolved satisfactorily if for the time being at
                            least there is a moratorium on public pronouncements on both sides.</p>
                        <p>5) You should also make it clear there is no question of our continued
                            support for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort in Congo. We
                            continue to believe that it affords the only real hope of minimizing the
                            threat to world peace and of restoring stability to the Congo.</p>

                            said he expected to be able to get Sudanese Govt to release Adeel for

                            agrees with us, feeling Adeel too weak.) Dept may wish ask us to urge

                        <p>4. In his initial presentation and thoughout later discussion <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> also continued to express considerable
                            suspicion of Belgians and of their influence on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>. He particularly critical of

                                xml:id="pg_597" facs="0627"/>attitude, noting he claimed “victory”
                            at <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> seating. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> clearly regards Belgian Govt as
                            pressing active political interests against <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> in Congo. In accordance <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss> Barco urged him work out problems with Belgians on
                            case-by-case method and have moratorium on public statements. <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he agreed and found Van Den Bosch
                            easy to work with. He said Belgians wanted to “cooperate” with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He feels “coordination” all he can do
                            now. As example “coordination” he said Belgians should not attempt to
                            fill jobs <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> already holding. He cited
                            case of <gloss target="#t_ICAO1">ICAO</gloss> personnel whom Belgians
                            displaced. (We also think he means that Belgians should consult <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> before they fill any posts so <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can fill them first if <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> wishes.) <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> said he prepared to talk with Belgian rep but not for
                            few more days.</p>
                        <p>5. Re question improved cooperation between <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> agreed <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> action had strengthened <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> position and that it was important to build him
                            up. He said <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action had both advantages
                            and disadvantages. He thought latter outweighed former but did not
                            specify reasons. As result <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> decision he
                            thought <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> should now be
                            built up by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “internationally” but not
                            “nationally”. Barco said we consider <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            should cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                            not continue to put roadblocks in way of Congolese exercising their
                            authority. Psychologically it extremely important they not be rebuffed
                            every time they try to act with authority. When he cited Welbeck case as
                            example, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> defended <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action by saying proper expulsion order
                            (as distinguished from declaration he persona non grata), had not been
                            issued until after action against Welbeck begun. Barco replied we would
                            not expect Congolese to act in diplomatic affairs with precision of
                            Europeans; <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should have told Ghanaians,
                            at time Welbeck declared P.N.G., they should get Welbeck out, instead of
                            protecting him. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said perhaps he
                            himself should have done this here with Quaison-Sackey. (It not at all
                            clear yet extent to which <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> prepared
                            to go in developing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>–Congo cooperation,
                            and Dept may want instruct us go back to him on necessity <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supporting <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> nationally as well as internationally.)</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> seemed aware of dangers in
                            Orientale but did not commit himself on additional troop units or
                            getting Songolo out of <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName>’s
                            hands. On troops he observed Ethiopian were among his best. On Songolo
                            he said <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> taking continuing interest. He
                            said <persName corresp="#p_GA4">Gizenga</persName> periodically asked
                            for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> protection there, which <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> refusing until he released deputies; he
                            hoped this would bring him around. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            also said <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had refused permission for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> go to Stanleyville to
                            attend daughter’s funeral, pointing out this difficult decision to
                            take.</p>
                        <p>7. He referred again to need bringing Ileo govt into more active
                            operation and to necessity <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> establishing control over <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> in such govt as Chief of Staff
                            responsible to civil authority.</p>

                        <p>8. In course presentation Barco read to him all points Dept requested us
                            to put to him in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> virtually
                            verbatim. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he agreed with our
                            entire position (except <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>) and
                            our objectives were same. Nevertheless our distinct impression is that
                            there remains considerable difference of approach, as above report
                            shows, and that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> attitude not yet
                            satisfactory. We also told him what we expected to say to <persName

                            supporters in Congo. We told him we thought you needed time in Congo

                                >UN</gloss>. We also told him US continues support <gloss

                            cable from <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Touré</persName>. In that
                            message, <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Touré</persName> charged that the
                            United States had taken a “partisan position” and was supporting “the
                            enemies of African emancipation” in the Congo and threatened that if the

                            in the Conciliation Commission and would take “any position in African
                            affairs consistent with Congolese interests.” President <persName

                        <p>Was met with full military honors by Tshombe and we drove to his
                            residence together. In following one hour conversation with Tshombe and
                            four ministers, Tshombe voiced complaints regarding US attitude. Said
                            Katangan independence was fact and they would never resume political
                            association with Congo although prepared make arrangements financial
                            help to brothers in Congo. I reiterated US policy respect for integrity
                            of Congo and told him I saw no likelihood that any country would be
                            prepared near future recognize Katangan independence. He criticized US
                            failure show interest in 1961 Elisabethville Fair, to which I replied
                            that government funds for such purposes limited and usually committed
                            year or more in advance and US Government just cannot pressure private
                            business to participate. Told him I would raise question again with
                            Department. Comment: I consider it would be useful participate in some
                            way for political reasons and because Russians have reserved
                            considerable area for their exhibit.</p>
                        <p>Tshombe denounced Belgians for failure support Katangan independence
                            which I determined meant Belgian Government policy. Belgian colons, led
                            principally by Union Miniere, obviously encouraged Tshombe in separatism
                            which impression confirmed by later talks with others in Elisabethville.
                            Further accused US of being in league with Belgian Government to stifle
                            bid for Katangan independence. I told him US-Belgian relations at all
                            time low ten days ago and that his charge of collusion was totally
                            without foundation.</p>
                        <p>I asked what he thought of roundtable with other provincial leaders who
                            are anti-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>, to which he
                            replied he would have nothing to do with it. Said he considered
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> weak and ineffectual
                            and he should have taken lead in ousting <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> from beginning. I said our hope is that right
                            thinking Congolese leaders should work out solution to political impasse
                            referring to provisional nature fundamental law; and fact Parliament
                            constituted as primarily Constituent Assembly and only provisional as
                            legislative body. Tshombe insisted fundamental law “imposed” by
                            Belgium.</p>
                        <p>While I had feeling Tshombe might be exhibiting public profile for
                            benefit of his four ministers, my net impression at end of visit was
                            most pessimistic. Propped up by Nineteenth Century Belgian advisers and
                            growing to like the attributes of kingship, it seemed to me Tshombe was
                            hardening position of separatism.</p>
                        <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0632"/>
                        <p>In later talk with Berendsen (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) he told
                            me there had been no contact with Tshombe or ministers for over one
                            month. He too was discouraged over prospect obtaining Tshombe’s support
                            for effort to reunite Congo politically. Berendsen is level-headed
                            sensible man. Has been doing best he could under most difficult
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I saw <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> for one hour
                            and a half at his request and gave him straight synthesis of
                            conversations with Tshombe and my impression as stated above. I added
                            only possible good I saw coming out of trip was possibility that Tshombe
                            might have been shocked into recognition of reality which would
                            eventually destroy his concept of a Shangri-la in the Katanga. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> said he had just received a
                            telegram from Berendsen stating that Tshombe and his ministers has asked
                            for conversations and that atmosphere had cleared somewhat. I hope this
                            is good sign.</p>
                        <p>Further, reports that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has
                            obtained Tshombe’s agreement for meeting may also have been conditioned
                            by firmness with which I dealt with Tshombe’s attacks. I might add Kibwe
                            and Monongo were most violent in attacking US policy, are xenophobes and
                            lack any comprehension of the facts of international life. They are
                            definitely bad influence on Tshombe.</p>
                        <p>Aside from these acrimonious substantive discussions, Tshombe could not
                            have been more friendly or pleasant and the other aspects of the visit
                            were very pleasant. I have the impression that few if any people have
                            talked quite so frankly with Tshombe since independence.</p>

                        <p>Regarding your point in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> that

                        <p>Department agrees that formation such government would not entirely

                            would make it considerably more difficult for them to work openly

                            officers in New York for recent Congo debate have stressed view that
                            question of legality important for Africans and one reason French
                            Africans spoke for <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> was

                                facs="0634"/>not to support him would be to deny rule of law in
                            Congo. Moreover caretaker cabinet government might serve to swing some
                            fence-sitters into <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            column.</p>
                        <p>Regarding composition of new government, Department certainly does not
                            wish second guess you on best choice for <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss>, and would welcome any combination of moderates
                            which could gain acceptance. At same time, we continue feel Ileo should
                            chair Senate in view of Okito’s support for <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>, unless other anti-<persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> Senate President would be possible. Also agree
                            talent and accomplishments Commissioners should be utilized and feel
                            best way might be include them in government as permanent under
                            secretaries or in some cases as Ministers.</p>
                        <p>Department agrees that <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>
                            would be key to agreement this plan, and that <gloss target="#t_CNA1"
                                >CNA</gloss> support through him will be essential. We feel however
                            he might best be approached on basis that installation cabinet would get
                            him off spot of having to make repeated political decisions as de facto
                            power despite his disinclination do so as self-professed non-political
                            figure. Also could be pointed out that new cabinet would contain many of
                            “his” commissioners and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>
                            himself could be Minister Defense or Chief Staff. While establishment
                            new cabinet government could follow upon termination of Commissioner
                            government December 31, we see substantial advantages in return to
                            Cabinet government as soon as <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> can complete necessary arrangements. Advantages
                            are principally: (1) Further enhancement <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>’s legal and constitutional position and
                            personal prestige; (2) Strengthening of international support for Congo
                            government by strengthening its legal basis, thus following up on gains
                            made in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> acceptance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> credentials; (3) Improvement in
                            working relationship between <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            Congolese officials. We recognize however <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> may be unwilling step down until Commissioner
                            period expires December 31 and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> will have to work out question of timing.
                            Approach to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> at early
                            point would serve emphasize to him our view of need for early return to
                            civilian government.</p>
                        <p>It should also be emphasized that resumption of cabinet government by no
                            means precludes the calling of a Round-Table Conference which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> has announced he wishes to do,
                            since we assume that such a conference would be called primarily discuss
                            new constitutional arrangements. In any case might be considerable time
                            before such a conference, if held, produced any results in terms of an
                            agreed draft constitution and meanwhile the Congo would have made no
                            further progress in setting up a generally acceptable government to
                            function in interim.</p>
                        <p>Department feels that US can continue exert constructive influence in
                            Congo particularly now with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"

                        <p>We strongly hope <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> will reinforce

                            others to supply and assist Lumumbaists.</p>
                        <p>Without assuming existence of problem in this regard, you should assure

                            either Katanga or Kasai and gradual program for their reintegration was
                            possible and now appears be achieving results. Danger in Orientale is

                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>’s whereabouts in the Congo were unknown. He was
                            believed to be on his way to Stanleyville by road but it was possible he
                            might be traveling by river. There was also a rumor that he had gone to
                            Luluabourg. If <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> turns up in
                            Stanleyville, he will have tribal and other support of such a nature
                            that civil war in the Congo may ensue. During the last few days
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s supporters have been
                            trekking toward Stanleyville in small numbers, [<hi rend="italic">less

                            and arrest of Europeans in Orientale Province preliminary to their
                            expulsion. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that things were quieter
                            in the Congo today than they were yesterday but the situation remains
                            dangerous. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Representative in
                            Stanleyville had asked for the emergency air evacuation of 1000
                            Europeans yesterday but had cancelled the request today, [<hi

                            indicated that the Egyptian Ambassador had no advance knowledge of

                            a “disturbed personal condition.” Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            concluded his briefing on the Congo by reporting that the <persName

                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> began discussion by reading
                            several telegrams he had received from <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> regarding recently expressed anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attitudes by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, Ileo and others. Main point
                            seemed to be emphasize to us difficulties he felt he had in dealing with
                            Congolese. He stressed anti-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> attitude
                            had increased since seating <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> in New York although it might logically have
                            been expected move in other direction. (He seemed give no recognition to
                            effect of conflict over Welbeck on <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>–Congo relations.)</p>
                        <p>3. He said Congolese [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] were easily depressed and easily excitable.
                            Recent successes had made them “cocky”. For example, he referred to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s statement here that
                            time was coming when <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should start
                            remove its military units. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said
                            neither <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> nor his
                            supporters nor any Congolese by themselves could as of now run Congo
                            without <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support and he hoped we would
                            bring this home to them. He also cited <persName corresp="#p_BJM2"
                                >Bomboko</persName> statement to <persName corresp="#p_DR4"
                                >Dayal</persName> that “Congo at war with <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>”. When <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>
                            objected, <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName> reportedly said
                            “at least <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> is”.</p>
                        <p>4. Barco replied what <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said about
                            Congolese probably true. They were inexperienced and no doubt excitable.
                            This was framework in which we had to learn to work. Our own reactions
                            to such situation should not be emotional but carefully thought out.
                            Perhaps Congolese did need be handled with firmness but they must also
                            be treated with sympathy. Care must be taken as specific problems arose
                            not rebuff them.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> agreed to this as way to handle
                            specific cases, but he noted there also was question of general
                            attitude. This was harder to define but essentially <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must keep them “chastened”. At another

                            presented unusual difficulties because some African governments would

                            government Congo and seek support him as such. In all he thought as many

                            which should soon be evident if my guess is correct. This likely take
                            form of concentrated attack on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            particularly <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> for favoring

                            addition to some ability in the diplomatic field. A part of the problem
                            lies, of course, in the fact that no clear or strong mandate has been
                            given to <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> by New York. Its posture
                            has accordingly been hesitant, uncertain and largely ineffective. This
                            became evident early to the Congolese who interpreted this as weakness
                            and they have accordingly issued themselves licenses to do as they
                            please. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> response has been to deal
                            with the resulting brushfires on an ad hoc basis without any clear

                            cooperation. I believe <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (Ormsby-Gore)
                            would be agreeable to joining in such démarche and that it would be
                            additionally effective if this were case. First objective of such
                            approach should be take advantage Hammarskjold’s intention replace Von
                            Horn as Supreme Commander and ask for appointment outstanding officer to
                            take over as senior <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> official in Congo
                            but we should also try to bring about major reorientation <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s policies.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policies should be
                            concerted to this purpose promptly and that approach be made to <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> just as soon as possible, i.e., this

                        <p>3. Fol is suggested US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> policy line for
                            approach to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>(a) We alarmed at drift in Congo which, if continued, likely result in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> failure and bankruptcy.</p>
                        <p>(b) We believe steps need to be taken both by <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and by Congolese to assure this does not happen and that
                            cooperation replaces recrimination. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> willing to help assure this.</p>
                        <p>(c) On <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> side we see necessity certain
                            definite actions as fol:</p>
                        <p>(1) <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> rep in Congo needs to be changed so
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and Congolese
                            moderates have confidence in it. Relations between Congolese and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> are such that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName> cannot command cooperation from
                            Congolese and we think he should be replaced. We understood Von Horn
                            also about to be replaced. Von Horn replacement should be of such
                            stature and ability that he can weld <gloss target="#t_UNOC1"
                                >UNOC</gloss> into effective command which will be more consistent
                            than <gloss target="#t_UNOC1">UNOC</gloss> now is. This officer should
                            be someone with combat experience and administrative capabilities. If
                            immediate replacement of <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>
                            proves difficult, new CO should also become in effect chief <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> official in Congo. We have in mind people
                            like Gen Bull (Norway), etc. for this spot (see <gloss target="#t_USUN1"

                        <p>(2) Think <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> should take this and other

                            Ghana, Guinea and those of similar view will also not be satisfied by

                                >Lumumba</persName>. We consider it much more important to have
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> succeed in Congo than to
                            ameliorate their criticism.</p>
                        <p>(3) We also believe <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> should promptly
                            settle differences with Belgians on civilian aid in Congo. There is no
                            possibility <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> having enough funds to
                            replace all Belgian civil assistance in Congo. Nor is Congo viable
                            without such help. Therefore modus vivendi must be arranged to assure
                            that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Belgians are working in
                            harmony or at least not at cross-purposes. We think <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> must work this problem out promptly. We
                            are urging same thing on Belgians and are willing to help <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to seek to eliminate such political and
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> influences which exist on
                            Belgian side.</p>
                        <p>(4) In Congo <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must take more active
                            initiative in trying to work with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> and moderate forces in Leopoldville with view
                            to helping them really take hold of governmental machinery. <gloss

                                >Kasavubu</persName> del established necessary political lead in
                            this direction. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should also
                            reinstitute efforts to assist in training and organization <gloss

                            effective leadership and control and welding it into unified force.
                            Finally <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be more active in
                            areas, such as Stanleyville, where nationally directed control by Congo
                            itself has broken down, to assure maintenance of law and order.</p>
                        <p>(d) On Congo side US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> are willing to
                            take steps to seek assure Congolese cooperate with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as fol:</p>
                        <p>(1) We will strongly press <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                            >Kasavubu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BJM2">Bomboko</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> to reorganize govt
                            in way which will make it more regular and effective. Specifically we
                            will urge govt be formed to replace College of Commissioners and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> be brought into it
                            in some constitutional fashion, preferably as Chief-of-Staff. We will
                            urge them to establish govt in way which will give supremacy to civilian
                            institutions. We will also urge them to say they intend submit it to
                            Parliament as soon as possible, although we cannot say when this would
                            actually be. We can only be successful in this, however, if we can show
                            them this will bring <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cooperation.
                            Therefore <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s attitude on personnel
                            and willingness <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to extend cooperation
                            is essential element.</p>
                        <p>(2) We will also tell <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> we do not believe
                            Congo unity and integrity can be preserved without <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> assistance at this time and that they
                            must develop close cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            We will be willing to stress to them firm US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> backing for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and to say
                            our continued support Congo authorities based on assumption they make
                            every effort cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(3) We prepared also exert such influence as we have with Tshombe to
                            persuade him make arrangements with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> which will assure maintenance Congo unity and
                            establishment national govt with effective authority throughout Congo.
                            We also will intercede with Belgians on this, although contrary to
                            general impression, they are not advocating Katanga separatism.</p>

                                treason. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note> Hope Department is
                            not assuming from a few modest successes that Embassy has <persName

                                >Mobutu</persName> or any other Congolese “in pocket”. While we have
                            consistently endeavored through counsel and advice to guide moderate
                            elements along reasonable path, they rarely consult us voluntarily
                            regarding prospective moves. This should be evident in light of reported
                            examples impulsive action by even our closest friends against which
                            Embassy would have advised them had it been forewarned. In fact our most
                            strenuous efforts have been engaged in putting out senseless brush-fires
                            started by ill-considered actions or statements concerning which we had
                            no forewarning. It would be necessary to live 24 hours a day with the
                            principals in this drama to know what role they may decide to play at
                            any given moment. I like to <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0647"
                            />think if we were really directing this show a somewhat more
                            professional performance could be expected. I can add only that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s coterie of advisers
                            encountered the same difficulties even though they had him literally
                            hedged in.</p>
                        <p>We have consistently advised all participants against violence and
                            inhumane treatment and continue to do so. It must however be understood
                            that in the Congo what passes as inhumane to US is customary among them.
                            Thus the abuse of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> shocks
                            civilized countries while Congolese themselves consider he is pampered.
                            Fact is he is much better treated than any other prisoner has been to
                            best our knowledge. <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>
                            continues to assert he will be tried in a proper court with legal
                            safeguards. I am certain <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            fully supports this proposal and will endeavor have him so inform <gloss

                            been hearsay so far as inhumane conditions of confinement are concerned
                            and he obviously did not have accurate information regarding physical
                            well-being of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. <persName

                        <p>In case Songolo, Department is fully informed of documented brutality
                            practiced by pro-<persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> masters
                            of Stanleyville. I still feel this would be useful line in Security
                            Council debate as counter to Soviet bloc charges. Also realize may be
                            attempt to negotiate release <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> as quid pro quo release Songolo et al. Aside
                            from fact I do not believe <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            would settle for any such deal, if consummated it would put us back to
                            July and August. I realize Dept and <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> are having and will continue to have very rough time
                            in New York and that a government with more claim to legitimacy would
                            make it easier to deal with Soviet bloc attacks and with African
                            community. In spite of efforts along lines long since mapped out and
                            agreed, we have not made measurable progress in convincing <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"

                            back to Ileo Government or establishment of any other Cabinet. We cannot
                            dictate either terms or timing. Furthermore, possibility of obtaining
                            full session Parliament is dimmer today than a month ago owing to
                            hardened position Tshombe and probable refusal Kalonji to permit Kasai
                            Deputies to attend. This would make serious inroads on already

                        <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0649"/>
                        <p>“In suggesting this discussion, I would like to make it very clear to you
                            that I remain fully satisfied that our principal objectives relating to
                            the Congo have been and are similar. This does not preclude the constant
                            necessity of keeping in step on the tactics each of us utilizes in

                        <p>In démarche, it would be preferable for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            to take lead, particularly since question of replacement of <persName

                            and certain other countries clearly considering removal their troops

                                >SYG</gloss>, I also believe it should be made clear that US
                            believes Von Horn should be replaced as urgent measure. You should
                            indicate we would welcome Generals McKeown or Bull as replacement. We
                            also inclined think General Thimayya of India, or possibly General
                            Cariappa, former CINC of Indian Army, might be acceptable, but you
                            should discuss these possibilities in first instance with <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> in New York; (3) You should also discuss

                            situation were having increasingly difficult time holding line against
                            dedicated enemies who sought personal or national ends in Congo
                            situation. Those who could be expected support genuinely neutral policy
                            which would permit Congolese people to solve own problems are becoming
                            disturbed over simple fact normal executive machinery is not operating
                            in Congo and many are inclined to feel a military dictatorship, which
                            they dislike, is in fact now operating here. I assured him again we
                            wished to be as helpful as possible and urged upon him the necessity for
                            asking such changes as we recommended in order that Congo
                            representatives and friends at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would
                            be given the necessary means for attracting and holding largest possible
                            number of nations in this middle group. I said failure or delay in
                            taking such steps might seriously jeopardize future of moderate

                        <p>This morning I went over the same ground with Adoula who is politically
                            more perceptive and who has been working with other leaders including
                            Bolikango, Ileo and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>. He
                            urged that he talk also with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> with whom his relations have been good in past
                            but over preceding two months have slightly cooled. I believe he will
                            now make effort to sit down with <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and discuss creation of Cabinet which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> can appoint.</p>
                        <p>I have appointment with <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            early Monday afternoon during which I shall make same pitch. Earlier
                            date could not be obtained. Embassy has reported I think fully on
                            developments and actions in line with agreed policy although we have
                            refrained from reporting in <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0651"
                            />detail conversations with leaders which did not produce facts or
                            indications of significance. We have used other channels as appropriate
                            for reporting.</p>
                        <p>I think I am fully and sympathetically aware of the need for an urgent
                            solution along lines Department has so ably laid out. We have found out,
                            however, from bitter experience here that it is possible to achieve
                            results opposite to or different from those sought by pressing Congolese
                            too closely or too hard. I am satisfied that Soviets erred in that
                            respect and that it was one of important contributing causes of their
                            ouster. Congolese are extremely sensitive to pressure even when it is
                            exerted in their own interests as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            should already have found out. Department and <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> can be sure we shall take them down the right road as
                            fast as we think they can be inspired to move and that our best efforts
                            are being expended to that end. I would be less than candid if I were to
                            express my feeling that this can be accomplished in next few days. One
                            of difficult problems which Congolese themselves must solve is
                            composition new Cabinet. Until that is agreed upon by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and other leaders, or they agree to restore Ileo
                            government as now constituted, we cannot expect them to eliminate
                            College of Commissioners since it is only government now operating. I
                            can, however, without exaggerating say that I believe since urgency has
                            finally been injected into principal participants and that they
                            understand the issues, I am satisfied they are doing their best to come
                            up with a solution which will meet the exigencies of present situation.
                            Furthermore, and most important, they have not lost their confidence in
                            our friendship and disinterested consideration for their well-being and
                            success.</p>

                        <p>The Security Council discussed the situation in the Congo at nine
                            sessions between December 7 and 14. A Soviet draft resolution submitted
                            on December 8 (U.N. doc. S/4579) called upon Secretary-General <persName

                            Congo’s “lawful Government and Parliament,” requested the U.N. <pb

                            military, paramilitary, and civil personnel from the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Also on December 8, Argentina, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United
                            States submitted a draft resolution (U.N. doc. S/4578) expressing
                            concern for the protection of human rights in the Congo. A slightly
                            revised version introduced on December 13 (U.N. doc. S/4578/Rev.1)
                            expressed the expectation that no measures contrary to recognized rules
                            of law and order would be taken against any persons held prisoner or
                            under arrest anywhere in the Congo, expressed the hope that the
                            International Committee of the Red Cross would be allowed to examine
                            detained persons throughout the Congo, and requested the
                            Secretary-General to continue his efforts to assist the Congo to restore
                            law and order and to adopt all necessary measures tending to safeguard
                            civil and human rights for all persons in the country.</p>
                        <p>At an extended meeting of the Council which began on the evening of
                            December 13 and ended at 3:45 a.m. on December 14, the Soviet Union
                            proposed 5 amendments to the four-power draft resolution (S/4578).
                            Subsequently, the Argentine Representative introduced the revised draft
                            resolution described above (S/4578/Rev.1). The Council voted first on
                            the 5 Soviet amendments, all of which were defeated. The four-power
                            draft resolution received 7 favorable votes, 3 opposed (the Soviet
                            Union, Poland, and Ceylon), and 1 abstention; thus it failed as a
                            consequence of a Soviet veto. The paragraph of the Soviet draft
                            resolution calling for the withdrawal of Belgian personnel was rejected
                            by 6 votes to 4, with 1 abstention; the remainder of the resolution was
                            defeated by 8 votes to 2, with 1 abstention.</p>
                        <p>The Polish Representative then proposed a draft resolution (U.N. doc.
                            S/4598) requesting the Secretary-General to undertake the necessary
                            measures to obtain the immediate release of <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and other imprisoned members of Parliament. It
                            was defeated by 6 votes to 3 with 2 abstentions.</p>

                            bring about reorganization of Congolese Govt. He was somewhat
                            pessimistic about results, especially because of failure <persName

                            establishing his supremacy over <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> at that time. He thought it would be helpful for
                            governmental change to be brought about before he goes to Congo if
                            possible.</p>

                                >Dayal</persName> and Congolese and says he can see evidence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>’s attitude toward them
                            in his telegrams. He expects that in due course <persName

                            indicate when this might happen though we had impression it would not be

                            would not serve under command of Indian general and that Indians would
                            not serve under Pakistani general. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>

                            of present talk was political blackmail to see how far they could push

                                >UAR</gloss> had also said in September they were withdrawing troops
                            but that <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> had not been embarrassed at
                            not carrying this out. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> indicated he
                            would be glad to be rid of Guinean troops. He said he would not ask us
                            to fly them out if sea transportation were available. Moroccan
                            withdrawal would be more serious problem, but he showed no concern that
                            it might happen immediately and seemed regard King’s declaration as
                            hedged. He said he had already made initial sounding about increased

                            <persName corresp="#p_BSAT1">Balewa</persName> had replied he could not

                            whether this meant it would be politically difficult for Nigeria to

                            they could not actually be spared. He suggested we (especially <gloss

                            He also thought Senegalese troops might be brought back. He said his

                            had not been good and that for political reasons he preferred not go

                        <p>6. On talking to Belgians about their civilians in Congo, <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> showed some annoyance and also lack of
                            real desire to talk at this point. While in his customary fashion of
                            delayed responses he may change mind later, today he said he could only
                            discuss problem of Belgians on one of two bases: (a) that Belgian Govt
                            had nothing to do with Belgians in Congo, in which case he could discuss
                            problem only with Congolese, or (b) that Belgian Govt did accept
                            responsibility, in which case discussion would have to be under context
                            of emergency <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> res on Congo (which
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> has previously interpreted as

                            portion of Belgians in Congo, such as teachers, doctors, etc. but only
                            with two to three hundred Belgians in key <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625"
                                facs="0655"/>positions. He said there were three to five Belgians in
                            key positions in each ministry of govt and that they were ones who were
                            causing problem. He said he did not accuse Belgian Govt because had no
                            evidence that govt was in fact doing this (although he obviously certain
                            it and they probably are). But he thought govt could exert considerable
                            influence in right direction if it wished. He referred specifically to

                                Telegram 1671 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, December

                                urged the Department to take this up with the Belgians. (Department

                                >ICAO</gloss> case where Belgians were brought in to take over
                            control towers of airports although <gloss target="#t_ICAO1"
                                >ICAO</gloss> had already hired people for job. Our impression is
                            that he would like to establish in principle that all key Belgian
                            officials in group of 200 or 300 he mentioned should be replaced by
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> officials but that in practice
                            this would either take considerable period of time or would never be
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>7. He agreed he had to go to Congo, especially as he still intended to go
                            to South Africa in January. His conversations with <persName

                            potentially serious at moment as Congo and that he should give that

                            institution, he said he was worried that current development, where

                            Secretariat, might do permanent damage to <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            displace some of this blame. He gave only elliptical indication of what

                            current political situation. For one thing he plans point out he has
                            constantly taken politically more advanced position than <gloss

                            security if, through such actions, they help bring about collapse of

                                >UN</gloss> executive machinery he also favors establishment in
                            Congo of small political unit (possibly Nigeria, Ethiopia and Malaya,
                            who are officers of Conciliation Commission) composed of reps of states
                            who would share responsibility for decisions there. He believes,
                            however, that this unit must have some kind of legislative backing,

                                >SYG</gloss> said he was especially interested because he thought

                            we should proceed with Belgians along lines suggested by <gloss

                            following discussion, which lasted approximately an hour and a half, I
                            told him that I wanted, if possible, to discuss any and all matters in
                            which he felt there was some question regarding US policy, the
                            activities of the Embassy and myself in particular. I told him I was
                            prepared to answer any questions that I could and informed him of our
                            own views and actions.</p>
                        <p>He then proceeded to give me for ten minutes or more his concept of the
                            job which he has undertaken, emphasizing that he did not ask for it and
                            accepted it only because of his feeling of duty to help the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort. He pointed out his own long
                            record of service to his own government and to international bodies and
                            said that he had only the best interests of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> at heart. He added that he was terribly worried over the
                            present situation in Congo, said that the Stanleyville mess was serious
                            and believed that certain governments would now support the rump
                            government announced by <persName corresp="#p_GA4"
                            >Gizenga</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had never questioned his principles and that I felt
                            sure he was doing what he could to ensure a successful <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> effort. I added that that was also the
                            policy of the US and of the Embassy. I said that no action taken or
                            statement made by any responsible American official from the President
                            on down had violated our policy of <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628"

                        <p>I said that we deplored such acts as much as he did. I followed this up
                            by saying that it has been alleged in certain quarters that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> are in US hands and assured
                            him that this was not the case. He said that the US had supported
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> and had placed him
                            “above the constitution”. I told him we had supported the seating of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> delegation since they
                            represented the Chief of State and that that position was one which had
                            been so far unchallenged by any government. I added that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>’s position is no different than
                            it was prior to seating of his delegation so far as we are
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had hoped that the conciliation commission might have
                            come earlier before <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            arrest and that he had felt that it might bring <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> together so that civil war might be avoided. He
                            felt that we are practically in a civil war.</p>
                        <p>I said that our policy had been and continues to be to encourage local
                            leaders to agree upon a form of government and a Cabinet which they
                            could all support. I said we further hoped for the earliest possible
                            Parliamentary blessing of any new government so formed. I said that I
                            had called on <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> twice to
                            urge this proposal and had also spoken to <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> in the same regard.</p>
                        <p>He then raised the problem of Belgian interference and said that the
                            Commissioners are living [garble] Belgian mistresses “all of whom are
                            spies” and that the Belgian advisers of the Commissioners and of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName> are urging them to
                            hamper <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> activities and that Belgian
                            policy is obviously to get the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> out of
                            the Congo. He said, frankly more by implication than direct accusation,
                            that US policy was in league with the Belgians.</p>
                        <p>I said that our relations with Belgians had reached an all time low just
                            before our statement in connection with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                >SYG</gloss> proposal to have all Belgians removed from the Congo. I
                            added that it was scarcely credible that American policy was designed or
                            could be interpreted to be in league with such dark Belgian designs. I
                            said on the contrary our feelings had been that some means must be found
                            to eliminate foreign advisers, Belgian or otherwise, who were
                            obstructing the performance of legitimate <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> functions but that we frankly did not feel all Belgians
                                <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0659"/>could be so categorized. I
                            added that I had suggested the possibility of forming a committee of
                            cooperation in Leopoldville which would include representatives of
                            Belgian Government, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Congolese
                            Government and asked whether he thought such a commission might be
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>He said emphatically he did not believe it could perform any useful
                            function until the principle had been decided and accepted by the
                            Belgian Government. He identified the principle as the one enunciated in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution which called for the
                            channeling of all aid through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that we had followed such policy and had not departed from it
                            except in minor case such as establishment English-language training
                            center which had been fully coordinated with <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and had their blessing before it was inaugurated. I said
                            that Belgian case seemed to me slightly different from others in view of
                            the history of Belgian administration and their very large investments
                            here.</p>
                        <p>He still affirms that Belgium must accept this principle or <gloss

                        <p>M. Lucet presented to the Ministers a paraphrase of the following paper
                            which had been agreed to by the tripartite African experts:<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d285fn2">Prepared by a tripartite working group on the Congo
                                (apparently Sauvagnargues, <persName corresp="#p_PJK1"
                                    >Penfield</persName>, and Boothby), at the request of <persName

                                The paper purported to express the sense of a discussion between
                                those three on December 14 and was approved by them at a meeting on
                                December 15. The text of the paper, as incorporated in the
                                memorandum of discussion at the December 15 meeting, is virtually
                                identical to the “paraphrase” here quoted. The December 14 and 15

                        <p>“In the face of the latest developments in the situation in the Congo,
                            the Western countries should have as their objective:</p>
                        <p>(a) to reenforce the position of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(b) to avoid the installation in Orientale Province of a <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> bastion which could at a later
                            date be furnished with arms by Egypt or the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as concerns (a), it is desirable to persuade Mr. Hammarskjold to
                            improve cooperation between the local organs of the United Nations and
                            the Leopoldville authorities.</p>
                        <p>Even though the College of Commissioners was invested by the Chief of
                            State, the representatives of the Secretary General in Leopoldville have
                            persistently protested its legality and frequently blocked its
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>The démarche mentioned below would be facilitated if, as appears to have
                            been envisaged recently, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> should decide, in accord with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLGJD1">Mobutu</persName>, to clarify the juridical and
                            constitutional situation by setting up a Government composed of
                            ministers without, however, convoking the Parliament. This last point
                            could be made not collectively, but individually, by the three
                            Ambassadors in their talks with their Congolese interlocutors, taking
                            the precautions which are indicated by our desire not to intervene in
                            internal Congolese affairs.</p>
                        <p>In order to affirm without question his authority, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> should doubtless give evidence
                            of his capacity to reestablish the necessary cooperation between the
                            provinces with a view to assuring to the Congo the economic unity
                            without which it cannot be viable. The calling of a round table of
                            Congolese leaders would permit putting off until a relatively distant
                            date convocation of the Parliament. The key to the problem is in the
                            hands of Mr. Tshombe, whose intransigence unfortunately appears greater
                            than ever. We should, therefore, examine what means we dispose of to
                            influence the problem through actions by the Belgian Government; <pb
                                n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0663"/>actions by the moderate African
                            states and particularly the Community states.</p>
                        <p>For Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName> the accusation of
                            collusion with the Belgians might be a source of weakness. It is
                            important that Belgian technical assistance to the Congo, indispensable
                            for obvious reasons, should be less apparent than is actually the case.
                            A solution to this problem would be facilitated by an examination of the
                            Belgian proposal to establish an efficient liaison with the United
                            Nations. These points can be pursued further in Brussels.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as concerns (b), it would be desirable to encourage efforts
                            tending to reestablish ties between all the provinces of the Congo. The
                            United Nations command should maintain a very strict control over all of
                            the contingents placed under his orders as well as over the air fields
                            of Orientale Province through which <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> supporters might be furnished arms.</p>
                        <p>Troops of the countries who have withdrawn their contingents from <gloss
                                target="#t_ONUC1">ONUC</gloss> should evacuate the Congo with their
                            equipment as promptly as possible.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Stanleyville might become serious if Sudan and Ethiopia
                            change their attitude with regard to the supporters of <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>. Sudan commands the approaches
                            to Orientale Province. The <gloss target="#t_ONUC1">ONUC</gloss>
                            detachment in Stanleyville is Ethiopian. In this connection the
                            indications of a change in the Sudanese position as well as the coup
                            d’état in Addis Ababa<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">Reference is to an
                                attempted coup on December 14.</note> appeared disturbing.”</p>
                        <p>During the course of his presentation he referred to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DR4">Dayal</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> official in Congo, “as not especially wonderful for his
                            job.”</p>
                        <p>He also mentioned Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>’s
                            concern expressed earlier about the withdrawal on January 1st of the
                            Belgian technicians from the air bases at Kamina and Kitona.</p>
                        <p>Since the Soviets had vetoed in the Security Council the Western
                            resolution on the Congo it appeared that the Congo item would be
                            reintroduced into the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered what would happen to the Ethiopian troops
                            stationed in Stanleyville in view of yesterday’s coup in Addis
                            Ababa.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said he had no idea
                            what would happen in Stanleyville. It was necessary for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to keep control of the airport there in
                            order to deny it to the Egyptians and/or Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Sir Frederick referred to a recent good talk between the British
                            Ambassador at Khartoum and Sudanese Prime Minister. The Sudanese claimed
                            still to be on the side of the West but were dickering with the Soviets
                            on a military arms program.</p>
                        <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0664"/>
                        <p>M. Couve said there was only one problem in the Congo. A real government
                            must be formed. The next two steps would be for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to recognize that government and then
                            work with it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as long as <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> was in jail, he thought it should be relatively
                            easy for Parliament to convene in some safe place and ratify a new
                            government. Parenthetically, he said the Belgians earlier this week had
                            told him they had given Tshombe a bad time during his stay in
                                Brussels.<note n="4" xml:id="d285fn4">Tshombe made an unofficial

                        <p>M. Couve said the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> people don’t want a
                            government in the Congo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> referred to his
                            statement made to the other deputies concerning the fact that the
                            problem of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in the Congo would
                            become academic if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member
                            countries did not contribute to the cost of that operation. The US had
                            pledged upwards of 40 million dollars (some of this conditionally the
                            Secretary interjected). With the Soviet bloc refusing to make any
                            contribution there was now the real question of whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation would continue. There is
                            general agreement that the situation in the Congo would become
                            appreciably worse if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops were
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was extremely worried about this problem. What
                            would happen if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops stayed on
                            without leadership, unpaid, and without transportation to their home
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said facetiously,
                            “They’ll be eaten.”</p>
                        <p>M. Couve said you can’t ask France to pay for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces in the Congo when France doesn’t know for what
                            purpose they were really sent. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            shouldn’t pay for Congo budgetary support. The Congo is not a rich
                            country but it has some resources and it could pay its way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said that bad as the

                            worse.</p>
                        <p>M. Couve said the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces can’t be held
                            in the Congo indefinitely acting as they do. There is only one sensible
                            thing to do, that is for the Congo to have a real government with a
                            small army of its own. And this is something no one from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> wants to do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said “but until then

                        <p>M. Couve said it shouldn’t take long to form a government.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the French position on non-payment was
                            conditional or positive.</p>
                        <p>M. Couve said that from the beginning the French said the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation had started in a bad way. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervened against Europe, and the
                            French didn’t think that was sensible. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> operation has contributed to the anarchy in the Congo.
                            There is a Swedish general, an Indian High Commissioner, and everybody

                            could solve the problem. They couldn’t have.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Boothby said that three weeks ago there would have been civil war. M.

                            gotten off on a bad footing in Katanga. Von Horn and <persName

                        <p>On December 16, at the request of the Representatives of India and
                            Yugoslavia, the U.N. General Assembly resumed discussion of the
                            situation in the Congo. An eight-power draft resolution was submitted on
                            December 16 by Ceylon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, the
                            United Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia (U.N. doc. A/L.331). That draft
                            resolution, as revised on December 19 (U.N. doc. A/L.331/Rev.l),
                            declared that the United Nations should “henceforth implement its
                            mandate fully” to prevent breaches of peace and security and <pb n="636"
                                xml:id="pg_636" facs="0666"/>to restore and maintain law and order
                            and that a standing delegation appointed by and representing the General
                            Assembly be located in the Congo to cooperate with the
                            Secretary-General’s special representative. It also urged the immediate
                            release of all political prisoners, the immediate convening of
                            Parliament with U.N. protection, and measures to prevent the Congolese
                            Armed Forces from interfering in the country’s political life, demanded
                            the immediate withdrawal of all Belgian military and quasi-military
                            personnel, and recommended that all necessary economic and technical
                            assistance should be provided promptly through the United Nations so
                            that it would not be used as an instrument for continuing foreign
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>On December 17, the United States and the United Kingdom proposed a draft
                            resolution (U.N. doc. A/L.332) that requested the Secretary-General to
                            “continue to discharge the mandate entrusted to him by the United
                            Nations,” to “continue to use the presence and the machinery of the
                            United Nations” to assist the Congo in restoring and maintaining law and
                            order throughout its territory, and to “continue his vigorous efforts”
                            to ensure that no foreign military personnel were introduced into the
                            Congo in violation of U.N. resolutions. It called upon all states to
                            refrain from providing military assistance to the Congo except through
                            the United Nations during the period of U.N. military assistance,
                            requested the Secretary-General to assist the Congo’s Chief of State in
                            establishing conditions in which Parliament could meet in security and
                            freedom from interference, and repeated the provisions of the four-power
                            resolution on human rights vetoed by the Soviet Union a few days
                            earlier. (See <ref target="#d281">Document 281</ref>)</p>

                            view, these states oppose any new action in Congo by <gloss

                            Madagascar could therefore at least abstain our res. Cameroun rep said

                        <p>After discussing the situation in the Congo at ten sessions between
                            December 16 and 20, the U.N. General Assembly voted on December 20 on
                            the two draft resolutions on the Congo (see <ref target="#d286">Document
                                286</ref>). The eight-power draft resolution was rejected by 42
                            votes to 28, with 27 abstentions. Of the African countries, only the
                            Congo (Léopoldville) and South Africa joined the United States in
                            opposing the resolution; Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Libya, Mali, Morocco,
                            Nigeria, Sudan, Togo, and the United Arab Republic supported it. The
                            U.S.-British resolution received 43 votes in favor, 22 against, and 32
                            abstentions. It thus failed to received a two-thirds majority and was
                            not adopted. No African nation voted for the resolution; Ghana, Guinea,
                            Mali, Morocco, and the United Arab Republic voted against it, while all
                            the others, including the Congo (Léopoldville), abstained.</p>
                        <p>The General Assembly then adopted without objection as Resolution 1592
                            (XV) an Austrian draft resolution providing that the General Assembly
                            would keep the Congo item on the agenda for the second part of the

                                >UAR</gloss> supplies to Salumu and <persName corresp="#p_GA4"

                            even possibly leading to split in country, and it would also produce
                            major political nuisance value. (Dean said it could develop into Malayan
                            type problem. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> immediately agreed
                            this was more apt comparison.) While not minimizing seriousness of

                            seemed unlikely magnitude problem would become greater (e.g,
                            Korean-type). Full-scale effort to utilize Stanleyville as base for
                            major military operation in Congo would mean <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                        <p>The President welcomed the Prime Minister, emphasizing our pleasure at
                            the fact that he had found it possible to visit the United States. The
                            Prime Minister similarly expressed his appreciation at the honor thus
                            accorded him.</p>
                        <p>Following a discussion of air communications in Africa, the Prime
                            Minister mentioned that he had recently been in Morocco. The President
                            spoke in friendly terms of the high esteem which he had for the King,
                            who had visited the United States last year. The Prime Minister said
                            that he had been greatly impressed in his recent trip to the independent
                            states of Africa with the quality of the leadership which he had found
                            generally in North Africa. The President said that he felt that this
                            area had a great future. We were anxious to have close and friendly
                            relations with the peoples of the North African area, but sometimes we
                            did not meet with the understanding of our policies and intentions which
                            we would like to see.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would like to speak in great frankness
                            and to tell the President that he had encountered a general feeling
                            among the leaders of North Africa that the United States did not
                            sufficiently understand their needs and their problems. He said that he
                            had heard this particularly from President <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> of Tunisia, who had spoken of his high hopes
                            of obtaining the understanding and assistance of the United States and
                            his disappointment that it had not been forthcoming in sufficient
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the cornerstone of American policy is to assure
                            the strength and stability of independent countries. We believe that in
                            so doing, we strengthen ourselves. However, there are heavy demands and
                            requirements for assistance in all areas of the world and it is not
                            always possible for us to respond as fully as we would like.</p>
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0677"/>
                        <p>The President mentioned, in this connection, the difficulties foreign aid
                            and the reciprocal trade program have encountered in the Congress, but
                            said that he was glad to say that there had been a greater understanding
                            of these problems during the last two weeks, and that there is now a
                            more promising prospect for legislation which will serve the liberal
                            foreign policy objectives which he had mentioned. The President
                            emphasized, in this connection, that the United States has no intention
                            whatsoever to dominate any country in the world. Our sole objective is
                            to buttress their stability, prosperity and independence.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that it is an unfortunate fact in
                            international relations that efforts to create a strong and durable
                            association between two countries usually encounter the problem of the
                            interests of a third country which intrude to complicate the desired
                            relationship. By way of illustration, he referred to Israel as a
                            complicating factor in American relations with the Arab countries. The
                            Prime Minister confirmed his agreement with the truth of this
                            observation.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had been struck, however, with the fact that many Arab
                            statesmen were prepared tacitly to accept the fact of an independent
                            Israel. The Prime Minister felt that this was particularly the case with
                            Libya. The President replied that he had often heard similar expressions
                            from Arab leaders. Unfortunately, however, they do not feel that they
                            can openly encourage a similar sense of reality by their people. The
                            Prime Minister agreed, observing that this is particularly true with
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The conversation broke off at this point for the reception before
                            lunch.</p>

                            sovereignty, it has sought to consolidate its independence and to create
                            the necessary conditions of economic stability. He stressed the
                            importance of a rising standard of living for the Ghanaian people and
                            said that Ghana’s vulnerability is its one crop economy; some way must
                            be found to diversify. The Prime Minister mentioned coffee, timber and
                            animal husbandry as possible fields for further development. Ghana also
                            hoped to bring about industrialization of the country, although it would
                            probably continue to be primarily an agricultural nation. All of these
                            economic objectives require power, the possibilities of which have been
                            investigated in connection with the Volta River scheme.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d295fn1">The proposed Volta River project included
                                construction of a dam with a hydroelectric power plant which would
                                power an aluminum smelter, development of Ghana’s bauxite mines, and
                                construction of railroad lines between the two. <persName

                                174)</note> The Prime Minister said that two possible dams were
                            involved, one at Ajena, which would cost 65 million pounds, and produce
                            one million <gloss target="#t_kw1">kw</gloss>; the other is at Abouya
                            and would produce 60,000 <gloss target="#t_kw1">kw</gloss> at a cost of
                            20 million pounds.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister continued by speaking of the huge deposits of bauxite
                            in Ghana, which, it has been estimated, would require two hundred years
                            to exhaust. The President said that he had been talking to Mr. Black of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> about this matter and that he
                            had indicated that the difficulty is that bauxite is presently so cheap
                            as to make new sources not particularly attractive. The Prime Minister
                            indicated assent, stating that this is the reason why Ghana does not
                            wish to rely on bauxite alone. The President said that he had previously
                            had the impression that the entire Volta River scheme would cost
                            considerably more than the “65 million which the Prime Minister had
                            mentioned. The Prime Minister replied that it is true that the entire
                            scheme is much more extensive than those components he had mentioned and
                            include facilities at the bauxite deposits, the smelter, and harbor and
                            railway facilities. Some of these were going along at the present time
                            in any event, particularly the new port at Tema. He said that he was
                            presently emphasizing the power aspect of the project.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the United States always tries to be helpful with
                            respect to projects of this kind. We believe that the best basis for
                            undertaking such development is private capital. If it is possible to
                                <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0679"/>get private aluminum
                            companies interested in this project, then the remaining financing could
                            be explored with the International Bank, the Export-Import Bank, the
                            Development Loan Fund and other similar sources. The President said we
                            would be delighted to continue our exploration of these possibilities.
                            He said that we entirely supported Ghana’s objectives of an expanding
                            economy and a rising standard of living. He went on to warn, however,
                            that such developments take place slowly and, by way of illustration,
                            mentioned the experience of the Philippines, where we had tried for
                            thirty years to create a viable economic and social base. The
                            Independence Law<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">The Philippine Independence
                                Act, approved March 24, 1934. (48 Stat. 456)</note> provided for a
                            further ten years temporary status in which further efforts were made to
                            assure that a strong economic basis would exist for Philippine
                            independence. Even with these preparations it was necessary to make
                            certain extraordinary arrangements whereby the Philippines had preferred
                            access to the American market for such produce as hemp, sugar and cocoa
                            after independence. The President mentioned these matters to indicate
                            that the construction of a strong viable economy is a long process.
                            Moreover it can be successful only if everyone cooperates.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by the President, the Prime Minister said that
                            Ghana is placing great emphasis at the present time on education. It is
                            spending more per capita in this field than any other African state and,
                            in fact, the rate of spending compares favorably with many European
                            countries. In response to a further question, the Prime Minister said
                            that Ghana’s ordinary budget is “48 million for the current fiscal year.
                            In addition to this, “22 million has been allocated from Ghana’s own
                            resources for economic development. The Prime Minister went on to say
                            that Ghana has a second five-year development plan which will involve
                            the allocation of “1 million, primarily to agricultural and industrial
                            expansion.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he understood that Secretary Benson<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d295fn3">Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson.</note>
                            had indicated at luncheon the previous day that he would be glad to go
                            out and take a look at Ghana. The President said that he thought the
                            Secretary could be very helpful in these matters. The Prime Minister
                            said that he would look into the possibilities of extending Mr. Benson
                            an invitation after his return to Accra.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the Volta River scheme, the President reiterated that the
                            State Department would continue to explore the possibilities of bringing
                            this project to fruition. He wished to assure the Prime Minister that we
                            would not forget his interest in this matter. The Prime Minister
                            expressed his appreciation. He added that his government would be most
                            grateful for any assistance which could be given in exploring the
                            problem with private aluminum interests. Even if such <pb n="650"
                                xml:id="pg_650" facs="0680"/>companies were not interested, however,
                            the Prime Minister hoped it would prove possible to press on with the
                            power aspect of the scheme, which would be beneficial to Ghana’s other
                            development requirements and, at the same time, might attract the
                            aluminum interests once a cheap source of power were created. The
                            President asked what other uses Ghana intended to make of the power and
                            the Prime Minister mentioned small industries and agricultural uses. The
                            President observed that the Ghana program sounded something like the
                            Rural Electrification Administration, which he described to the Prime
                            Minister. He then asked whether it was possible to start with the small
                            dam at Abouya which the Prime Minister had mentioned. The latter replied
                            that this was feasible and that it would have beneficial results.
                            Unfortunately, however, the site of this dam is not sufficiently near
                            the bauxite deposits.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned the importance of a coordinated plan for
                            diversifying Ghana’s economy and asked whether any kind of Coordinating
                            Commission existed. The Prime Minister confirmed that a Development
                            Commission has been in being for some time and is concerned with the
                            necessary planning.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he found Ghana’s economic plans to constitute an
                            exciting story. He thought that the world could somehow or other assist
                            Ghana in its realization.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he was also anxious to explore with the
                            United States Government possible means by which it could help with the
                            industrial development of Ghana, as we had done in the case of the
                            Philippines. The President expressed the hope that in the further
                            conversation which the Prime Minister and his party would be having with
                            the State Department, it would be possible for him to acquaint us with
                            enough of Ghana’s plans to permit us to speak somewhat more
                            specifically. The President said that he was sure that competent
                            agricultural scientists could advise Ghana on how it should diversify
                            its agriculture in order to obtain the maximum dietary benefits and, at
                            the same time, produce cash crops for export which would reduce the
                            present heavy dependence on cocoa. He asked about the work <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was doing in Ghana at the present
                                time.<note n="4" xml:id="d295fn4">The Department of State announced
                                on April 4 that the United States and Ghana had agreed on the

                            is doing a great deal of helpful work. The President said that he
                            thought this is a situation where technicians can be of enormous
                            benefit. The thing to do is to start moderately, utilizing the best
                            brains available in working out a coordinated program. Considerable
                            planning would be required. Once this had been accomplished, he thought
                            that it would be desirable to mobilize the <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651"
                                facs="0681"/>widest possible assistance in implementing the program.
                            It was particularly important to enlist the support of the people of
                            Ghana in order that the benefits should come about with the
                            participation of their hard work, rather than as the result of something
                            granted to them from outside. The Prime Minister signified his assent
                            and said that he would be happy to pursue these matters further in his
                            discussions with the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also mentioned the improvement of communications as an
                            area in which his government was most active. He cited the recent
                            establishment of Ghana National Airlines and the Black Star Shipping
                            Lines, which had been formed with Israeli participation, as examples.
                            The President asked if Ghana were trying to establish close relations
                            with Israel and the Prime Minister confirmed this to be the case. There
                            was further conversation regarding the possibilities for particular
                            crops in Ghana, with the Prime Minister mentioning rubber as a field in
                            which <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had recommended close study.
                            The President mentioned meat as a possible field for development,
                            mentioning the success which the southern part of the United States had
                            had with the El Santa Gertrudis breed. The President said Ghana might
                            wish to explore the possibility of importing two or three small herds as
                            a nucleus.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, the Prime Minister said that he would also like to
                            mention several political matters. He was deeply concerned about the
                            present instability in the world. He had recently toured the eight
                            independent African states which had been represented at the Accra
                                conference.<note n="5" xml:id="d295fn5">Regarding the Conference of
                                Independent African States, which met at Accra, April 15–22, 1958,
                                see <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> He felt that these
                            states had a united outlook. He noted that there are only eight such
                            nations at the present time and that the rest continue under the
                            domination of the metropolitan powers. Ghana wants to do what it can to
                            help them enjoy the same freedom which it now has. This is, the Prime
                            Minister observed, perhaps more Ghana’s problem than that of the United
                            States. He wished the President to know that at no place during his tour
                            had he noted the expression of any views which were antagonistic to the
                            United States. He had, however, found some disappointment. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> of Tunisia, for
                            example, who makes no secret of his pro-Western views, had expressed his
                            concern that the United States did not appear to understand his
                            problems. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> had told
                            the Prime Minister that he knew how difficult it was for the United
                            States to help every-one but that he did wish for greater understanding
                            than he had thus far received.</p>

                        <p>The President asked if he were to understand that the African countries
                            wished to cooperate informally among themselves. The Prime Minister
                            confirmed this to be the case, although he emphasized that the primary
                            area of cooperation is Africa. He noted that at the recent meeting in
                            Accra, the other African states had made very clear to the Egyptians
                            that they wished to confine their deliberations to African rather than
                            Middle Eastern questions.</p>

                        <p>78. I saw Prime Minister for half hour this morning prior his departure
                            for four day rest at unannounced destination. According to Adu of
                            External Affairs who was present, Acting Canadian <gloss
                                target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> and myself only diplomatic
                            representatives being received at this time.</p>
                        <p>Following are principal points:</p>
                        <p>1. Before I uttered word Prime Minister stated he considered trip to US
                            unqualified success from every point of view. He was impressed by warmth
                            of official and unofficial reception and all but overwhelmed by
                            hospitality. On substantive side he expressed pleasure with progress
                            made on Volta and other economic matters emphasizing rate of development
                            suited him entirely.</p>
                        <p>2. Re London talks he stated there had been no discussion of Volta.
                            Queen’s visit to Ghana late next year confirmed but exact date not yet
                            set. He partially evaded my efforts stimulate recital of his
                            conversation with Malik<note n="1" xml:id="d296fn1">Soviet Ambassador to
                                the United Kingdom Yakov Alexandrovich Malik.</note> but did relate
                            he lectured Malik on ways decrease East-West tension and “mistrust”
                            between great powers. Also indicated he had had difficulty countering
                            Malik’s pressure for exchange of diplomatic missions soon. He had
                            repeated need for further consideration of details, especially size of
                            Soviet mission here, and reiterated wish to have exchange take place
                            after Ghana goodwill mission to Moscow some time next year. As
                            indication of his wobbling on this line he said to Adu “we will probably
                            have to advance date for Moscow trip”. In answer my question he said
                            categorically no date set for diplomatic exchange.</p>

                                Assembly on August 13 on the subject of the Middle East; for text of

                            news unit of American troops being withdrawn from Lebanon. He seemed
                            pleased with my reference to several flattering comments in American and
                            British press re his <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> proposals.
                            However indicated uneasiness with rapid recognition of Iraq regime
                            saying he would continue withhold recognition by Ghana because “you just
                            cannot encourage these fellows to believe they can seize power by
                            subversion.” (Adu had told me previously that he and Prime Minister were
                            pleased with course of US position in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>
                            but that he and to lesser extent Prime Minister were dissatisfied with
                            British position in Jordan on grounds it was senseless to “prop up weak
                            and archaic regime”.)</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister’s remarks confirmed impression received from all other
                            sources that Prime Minister and associates highly pleased with US trip.
                            Is now clear that Prime Minister’s foremost objectives on domestic front
                            are construction of power dam (smelter of only secondary interest) and
                            large number of factories before Nigeria becomes independent. For
                            present he seems satisfied with US contribution and realizes delays
                            largely caused by Ghana’s slowness. Thus while situation now serene I
                            anticipate that before end of year he will clamor for positive actions
                            to provide large amounts public and private assistance from US.<note

                            characterized as (1) destructive and (2) constructive. The destructive
                            challenge was direct result of Soviet imperialistic Communism. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> accepted principle of “peaceful

                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had proved this by its relations with

                            assent vigorously interrupted at this point to say with obvious relish:
                            “Yes, they want to do all the “existing” and have others do all the

                            complicated by vital control problem arising from closed nature of
                            Soviet world which was quite different from open nature of Western,
                            especially US, world. He stressed current difficulties this subject stem
                            from our prudence in negotiating with a society that is reluctant to
                            reciprocate the open attitude we have demonstrated.</p>

                            understanding of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the “constructive challenge” confronting <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, Hare said it concerned countries
                            sometimes referred to as “underdeveloped” but which he preferred to call
                            “emerging” or “re-emerging” countries. He stressed <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has neither political nor economic
                            imperialistic designs; that only thing American people and their
                            government want is to see that development of strong political and
                            economic systems which will permit the full cultural expression of the
                            people within these countries as regards their political development,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0685"/>considered this the affair of
                            each individual country but hoped they would develop into strong nations
                            with external policies permitting them to maintain their political
                            integrity.</p>
                        <p>During this phase of conversation <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> frequently demonstrated his agreement with what
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> was saying.</p>
                        <p>Turning to subject of economic and cultural development of African
                            countries, <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> said <gloss

                            is confronted by a number of practical problems in attempting to provide
                            assistance. He remarked that in Department today no subject is of
                            greater interest than Africa, noting there were committees to study
                            specific African problems and mentioning the recent chiefs of mission
                            meeting in Tangier.<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">Held May 30–June 2; see

                            although <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has a clear general policy
                            regarding Africa, there was considerable difficulty in determining what
                            specifically should be done. Unlike Ghana, many of the emerging
                            countries were “formless” in that they were not aware of their own needs
                            or possible ways of meeting them such a situation placed <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in awkward position. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy was one of responding to
                            requests of others, not of imposing our own views therefore programs of
                            action are difficult to set out when the various countries are not clear
                            about what they themselves want. Hare concluded that he would like to
                            have any suggestions <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> might
                            make.</p>
                        <p>Nhrumah appeared genuinely pleased by this opportunity to express his
                            views and started out by recognizing that the problem was indeed
                            difficult. He made three major points:</p>
                        <p>(1) That <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should choose “certain
                            countries” in Africa to assist <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in
                            carrying out its policies and programs in Africa;</p>
                        <p>(2) That aid to Africa should be administered on a multilateral basis;
                            and</p>
                        <p>(3) That an “American” approach to Africa (as distinguished from a
                            “European” approach) should be developed.</p>
                        <p>In elaborating the first point <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> stressed that direct assistance from outside
                            Africa would be suspect to many African countries but that such outside
                            assistance could be funneled successfully through some truly independent
                            African state. He left little doubt as to the one African country he had
                            in mind which could be used. Within this context he cited both directly
                            and by inference, Ghana’s actions in relation to Guinea and Congo.</p>
                        <p>In relation to Guinea, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said
                            he had talked at length with Sekou Toure since Toure’s arrival in Ghana
                            June 28 for inaugural celebrations. He had questioned Toure directly on
                            reports of Communist penetration in Guinea and after two hours
                            discussion with Toure he thought the reports had been exaggerated to
                            some extent. He recalled that Ghana had tried to help Guinea initially
                            and indicated that <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0686"/>after
                            further conversation with Toure he (<persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>) probably would advance more of the ten million
                            pounds credit once offered by Ghana of which Guinea has already drawn
                            four million. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> added that
                            because of Ghana’s limited resources he had not been able to help Guinea
                            as much as he would liked; that if Ghana had been backed by help of
                            “other countries,” he could have done more to keep Guinea from becoming
                            so heavily involved with Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>In relation to Congo, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said
                            Belgians had sought his help as result he had sent some of his people to
                            Leopoldville and they had been able to convince <persName
                                corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJ8"
                                >Kasavubu</persName> to work together. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> expressed hope he himself could visit Congo near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>In presenting second point which concerned multilateral aid <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
                                >Hare</persName> about his conversations with me on possibility of a
                            “Colombo Plan” for Africa. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            then enlarged on his apprehensions for the former French territories in
                            Africa alleging that neocolonialism is keeping these countries under
                            thumb of France. He referred to Mali and Conseil de l’Entente countries
                            as travesties of sovereignty and eligibility for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> replied that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s conversations with me had
                            indeed been reported to Department. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> was aware that Department had taken careful note
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s hopes regarding
                            multilateral aid. This was a demonstration of US interest in <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s ideas and showed that our
                            request for <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s views was
                            not idle chatter. As an aside, which <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> appreciated fully, <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
                                >Hare</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> was thus playing a positive role in helping
                            formulation of US African policy.</p>
                        <p>In his third point <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said
                            that vacuums are being created throughout Africa which somebody will
                            fill. He declared Metropolitan powers still want to maintain their
                            positions but are unacceptable to the Africans and are thus unable to
                            fill these vacuums. He said other countries “with bad views” will try to
                            fill the void. Therefore it was urgent that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> move to fill the void, formulating its own policy
                            without worrying what the Metropolitan powers may think.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> responded that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is indeed developing its own African
                            policy, taking into account the views of the African nations and
                            peoples. It was however inevitable that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> should also take into account the views of the
                            Metropolitan powers. The policy that will emerge will be our own but it
                            can only be elaborated after consideration of all points of view.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said he realized this to
                            be both logical and inevitable.</p>

                            GOGhana’s determination to pursue more actively its policy of positive
                            neutralism (like India, it now seeks political support and material
                            benefits from any source so long as it feels this can be done without
                            dangerous involvement). It is not a turning away from the West. It is
                            Ghana’s idea of wide angle vision as it seeks political friends and
                            commercial bargains wherever they may be found. It is what Ghana regards
                            as the final breaking of chains that before independence kept Ghana
                            confined entirely to the West. I do not think this could have been
                            prevented by any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> action and feel <pb
                                n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0689"/>we must expect some more
                            manifestations of closer relations with Soviets before position
                            stability. I believe that when this point is reached the West will still
                            be far ahead.</p>
                        <p>GOGhana has always recognized <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            but never took initiative to exchange diplomatic missions. <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> Embassy is the 23rd diplomatic
                            mission established in Ghana and GOGhana claims and I believe it

                            effective support from US as he now has. He has told me this several
                            times recently. At same time he sees no reason to turn down <gloss

                            proves feasible and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> or US companies
                            not interested or not competitive with <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The purchase of 4 Soviet aircraft is part of expansion scheme announced
                            by Minister of Transport “to make Ghana airways the leading airline of
                            Africa”. Ghana simultaneously purchased five new British aircraft and
                            three second-hand American aircraft. Soviet prices and terms were more
                            favorable than others. The four Soviet aircraft now here are being used
                            by GOGhana pending delivery of the new aircraft.</p>
                        <p>I would not wish minimize dangers inherent in this increasing contact
                            with Soviet Bloc but feel we must be careful not to attribute motives to
                            GOGhana that do not exist. The West has always had a dominant position
                            in Ghana and in my opinion this will continue. I believe we would defeat
                            our own purpose if we tried at every turn to thwart contact with Soviet
                            Bloc.</p>
                        <p>To match <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> fully in cultivating
                            friendship with Ghana we would have to be more positive in supporting
                            Africa against European <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers. We
                            would also have to oppose “neo-Colonialism” in Africa and encourage
                            Ghana’s desire to create (in the words of Nkrumah) “a socialist New
                            Jerusalem” in Ghana.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion Ghana is not communist and I detect no desire here that it
                            become so. It is trying to develop a type of socialism that has its
                            roots in tribal life determined not to be exploited by East or West. I
                            feel we should endorse Ghana’s policy of positive neutralism and as far
                            as possible show Ghana by our deeds that we are truer friends than
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This will not be easy as long
                            as some of our official documents and unofficial papers emphasize we are
                            interested in Africa as a source of raw materials and market for our
                            manufactures while <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> cites
                            brotherhood as its motive.</p>

                            but accepted it after I explained necessity this formality and assured
                            him it did not mean reconsideration of broad question of loan. He asked
                            whether he should believe some talk that terms of loan to Ghana are less
                            favorable than those accorded certain other countries. I replied
                            negative (and I hope I am right). Those 2 points settled, President was
                            much pleased with outcome of what he called his “first effort to borrow
                            money”. He said he had come to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> first
                            because <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is his first friend; he had
                            always kept faith <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would help him and
                            this had been justified. He did not say directly but clearly indicated
                            this would confound some persons who had been cynical about <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> help. He especially wanted remind them
                            this <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> loan is money for shopping
                            among competitive US suppliers as contrasted with loan offered by
                            another government which itself would be sole bidder. He agreed this was
                            important factor in comparing interest rates and tied aspects of loans.

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities in which the President expressed his
                            pleasure at seeing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            again, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> thanked the
                            President for all the assistance he had given Ghana toward the
                            realization of the Volta project. However, he added, there were still
                            difficulties involving the question of rates.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d301fn2">Negotiations for a power rate agreement between
                                Ghana and the Valco aluminum consortium were in progress; U.S. and
                                    <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> financing was contingent
                                on an agreement. A letter of September 19 from Eisenhower to Nkrumah
                                stated that the U.S. Government would continue to follow the
                                negotiations closely. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                845J.2614/9–1960)</note> All could be solved, he thought, with an
                            additional loan of ten million pounds and he requested the President’s
                            assistance. After Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> explained some of the difficulties the President
                            said that we do indeed wish to work this out, adding that he has known
                            of no country where there has been a continued excess of power.</p>

                        <p>The conversation turned to the Congo with the President requesting Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s views on the crisis
                            prevailing there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said
                            that in his view the problems of the Congo were not insoluble. They must
                            however be worked out through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> fails, all small nations are
                            finished.</p>
                        <p>To this the President remarked that our whole policy is to work through
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as he explained in his speech this
                                morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d301fn3">See <ref target="#d34">Document
                                    34</ref>.</note> In his speech he had been careful not to place
                            the problem on what he described as a bi-polar basis. On the contrary,
                            our policy is to solve problems through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> even when we ourselves would prefer them worked out in
                            another way.</p>
                        <p>The President spoke highly of Secretary General Hammarskjold and praised
                            him for his great patience, a virtue of which he said he did not have an
                            abundance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> said he
                            held Hammarskjold in equally high esteem and noted that he has twice
                            visited Accra.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            remarked to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> that he
                            thought the latter could do a great deal with Guinea which is tending to
                            get off the road. The President supported this suggestion strongly. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> did not reply in
                            detail except to remark that he had this very much in mind.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> remarked that an appointment had been fixed for
                            him to call on <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            yesterday at 5:00 p.m. He had however not accepted this appointment (in
                            fact he did not arrive at Idlewild until 7:15 p.m. yesterday) as he
                            wished to call on President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> first.</p>
                        <p>The President then reminisced most interestingly of his experiences as
                            Supreme Commander during the war in which he had serving under him such
                            varied forces as the British, the French and the underground Belgian and
                            Netherlands forces. From this he learned that peoples differing widely
                            from each other could get along together and he wished that everyone
                            could have a similar experience. As he was arriving at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> building this morning the crowds shouted,
                            “Give ‘em hell, Ike, give ‘em hell.” But what do we gain by giving them
                            hell, he asked? Rather each country is really dependent on every
                            other.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            remarked that the Soviet Delegation was requesting the General Committee
                            to inscribe an item on the General Assembly agenda entitled “Situation
                            in the Congo”. The Secretary explained that we were opposed to
                            inscribing this item for the reason that this problem had just been
                            thoroughly discussed at the special session of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, that it was one which in any event
                            should <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0693"/>first be taken up
                            through the Security Council if there was need for it to be discussed
                            further, and that only then should it again be referred to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The conversation reverted to the President’s speech this morning, with
                            the President remarking that he was most enthusiastic of all over his
                            fifth point recommending <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aid for
                            education in Africa. He noted the need for furnishing teachers and
                            schools for use in Africa as well as for sending African students abroad
                            to study.</p>
                        <p>Referring again to the question of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            the President said he would be interested in the tune which the Soviet
                            Delegation adopts at this Assembly. The U.S. Delegation has but one
                            aim—to press forward with all other delegations.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation drew to a close Mr. Hagerty came in with the Ghanaian
                            Press Officer to receive guidance on what they should say to the press.
                            After this was received Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> spoke briefly of the situation between the Mali
                            Federation and Senegal,<note n="4" xml:id="d301fn4">Senegal seceded from
                                the Mali Federation on August 20; see <ref target="#d75">Document

                            the leaders of these two countries but with Houphouet-Boigny of the
                            Ivory Coast to ensure a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the interview, the President accompanied Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> to the elevator in
                            order that photographs might be taken by the numerous photographers

                            on him. He replied that he <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0694"
                            />would be glad to see me. The Secretary had suggested that I express to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> our surprise over the
                            contents of his speech at the General Assembly yesterday.<note n="1"

                        <p>About 3:30 this afternoon I received word through Mr. Dickenson that the
                            matter had been taken up with the Ghanaian Foreign Minister, who
                            expressed surprise at my request in view of the disparity in rank. I
                            suggested to Mr. Dickenson that he phone back to the Ghanaian official
                            with whom he is in touch to say that I, of course, accepted this, but to
                            point out that Marshall Tito had been glad to receive the Assistant
                            Secretary of State for European Affairs and that President Olympio had
                            received me. Ambassador Quaison-Sackey thereupon phoned to say he
                            thought that the Foreign Minister had been misunderstood; in any event,
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> did not know of
                            my request, that he was very friendly and would not stand on rank.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then remarked that his delegation had been very surprised
                            at the Secretary’s statement criticizing President <persName

                                xml:id="d302fn2">Not further identified.</note> I replied that we
                            were even more surprised at the contents of this speech. I noted that

                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s personal praise of Secretary
                            Hammarskjold, it was difficult to find a word in the speech showing any
                            understanding of the position of the West in the East-West conflict.
                            Moreover, in <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s discussion
                            of the Congo no mention was made of the unilateral intervention of the
                            Soviet Union outside United Nations channels involving the arrival of
                            several hundred Soviet technicians. Certainly, therefore, the content of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> speeches and the display
                            attached to the reception by the eastern bloc delegates of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> speech gave us every reason to
                            believe there had been collusion between the two. Ambassador
                            Quaison-Sackey said this was not the case, as he, himself, had fixed the
                            time for <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s speech several
                            weeks ago. He also remarked that the applause of the eastern bloc was
                            due to the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s
                            speech was anti-colonial in <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0695"
                            />tone. I said that this seemed ironic to me, since in our view the
                            Soviet Union was the greatest and most extreme colonial and imperialist
                            power in the world today.</p>
                        <p>The tone of the conversation was friendly at all times on both sides. The
                            question of an appointment for me to see <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> was left open.<note n="4" xml:id="d302fn4">No

                                >Nkrumah</persName> returned late yesterday and early this morning
                            called me to his office for talk lasting one hour.</p>
                        <p>At outset he praised <gloss target="#t_PAA1">PAA</gloss> charter and said
                            he had decided purchase two DC–8’s and two Boeing 702–s. Waldorf Hotel
                            was excellent and New York police wonderful.</p>
                        <p>President then named all prominent persons he saw which to me seemed
                            effort to dilute significance his meetings with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. He felt both USA and <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> genuinely desired disarmament and
                            said problem was “the chicken and egg question of which comes first:</p>
                        <p>Controls or disarmament.” He had been unable to get very far on this
                            subject with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> in New
                            York but <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had promised
                            send him letter to Accra within next few days. President indicated he
                            hoped he could be helpful in resolving this problem.</p>
                        <p>I replied there was no question in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            mind about which must come first; that the American people were in no
                            mood to let their government expose them to another Pearl Harbor; that
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> talks a lot but always backs
                            off when its bluff is called by our honest proposals. I thought best way
                            President could be helpful was to get <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to agree to open inspections by competent
                            observers.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Congo, President said he had heard about the public exhibition
                            of a letter he had written to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> and was thinking of releasing all his letters to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> which would set things
                            in proper light. He then read me extracts from several which advise
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> on administrative
                            problems. President told me his advice to <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName>
                            <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0696"/>to get <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> out of Congo meant he should remove need for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops before attempting other things.
                            President still regarded <persName corresp="#p_KJ8">Kasavubu</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> as legitimate
                            government which should be supported by <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> until Parliament might decide otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I questioned <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s suitability
                            as Prime Minister on basis his past showing and also wondered if
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> really was getting
                            true picture of <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>’s
                            behavior. President replied he (1) thought <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> adequate and (2) believed he was getting
                            complete and correct reports from Congo. I pressed my two questions
                            several times in modified form and believe they made President begin to
                            wonder.</p>
                        <p>President referred to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName>’s comments on his speech at <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He regretted Secretary’s
                            misunderstanding but had not wanted to make issue of it and had let it
                            pass without great public protest.</p>
                        <p>I replied that had not been case here where his party papers had kept up
                            vicious drum fire against Secretary. I thought calmness and restraint
                            would assist President in correcting any misunderstanding his speech may
                            have created and I was sure Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> would be most attentive to any further public
                            pronouncements President might make that would clarify his position on
                            subjects covered in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech. President
                            remarked he would be broadcasting to nation in next few days.</p>
                        <p>President then turned to Volta River project and said Kaiser people will
                            visit Ghana next week for final discussions now that power rate has been
                            agreed. There were two or three minor questions remaining but he thought
                            project now fully assured.</p>
                        <p>I expressed pleasure at outcome of long negotiations on Volta project but
                            said I thought there was one remaining big question that did not
                            directly involve <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> willingness to help
                            finance. In my view it involved wisdom of consortium putting its
                            stockholders money into a private enterprise here when CCP newspapers,
                            certain influential party men such as Tettegah and even some Cabinet
                            Ministers are in full cry against the evils of capitalism and economic
                            exploitation by the imperialist including US. I thought the President
                            had to declare himself. If he and his supporters did not want private
                            enterprise to undertake the Volta or some other project for the purpose
                            of making a profit he should say so at this time and the American
                            companies would go elsewhere; but if the President wanted the consortium
                            to proceed under conditions mutually agreed upon, then it was the
                            President’s responsibility to stop some of his supporters from their
                            campaign of hate against American and other “economic imperialists.” I
                            assured the President that I myself would advise Kaiser when he is here
                            next week to get this question settled clearly before signing any final
                            agreement. I said that quite frankly I was getting a bit weary of all
                            the double talk among some of his supporters who think they can have
                            things both ways.</p>
                        <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0697"/>
                        <p>President was clearly taken aback by my remarks but after I documented
                            them he agreed I was justified in my views. He declared he wanted the
                            private enterprise consortium to proceed and that he would take steps
                            immediately to bring all his supporters into line on his “four stream
                            development” plans. First stream was socialist type cooperatives and
                            fourth steam was private enterprise which if invited into Ghana would be
                            fully protected by Government of Ghana and hecklers silenced.</p>
                        <p>I said I was glad to have President’s assurance and wondered if he would
                            consider something else I recalled that when I arrived in Ghana three
                            years ago he had told me he would never permit Ghana soil to be used as
                            base for one outside country to attack another verbally. I had lived up
                            to this in supervising our information program here but now I find the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> Embassies here are distributing publications
                            containing anti-American material and in addition the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s were running a propaganda
                            factory here to feed the press with hate American stories. I wondered
                            how this stacked up against the President’s wish that Ghana not be used
                            as base for hate campaigns.</p>
                        <p>President expressed surprise which I feel was partially feigned but after
                            I documented my assertions he declared emphatically he would put a stop
                            to it as he would not permit Ghana being used as cockpit to fight cold
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Conversation was friendly from start to finish and President followed me
                            to steps to express his thanks for “this good talk.”</p>

                            unfortunate impression in this country because it reflected a complete
                            lack of appreciation of Western position on almost every issue and,
                            while consistently critical of West, failed to find fault with flagrant
                            unilateral Soviet intervention in Congo. By actions as well as words
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> seemed determined abet
                            Soviet cause. Under these circumstances and given adverse reaction many

                            encourage <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s role in Africa
                            unless and until he shows greater signs of stability and that his
                            actions are not furthering Soviet objectives in such matters as Congo
                            and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery. This does not mean
                            however that our relations with <persName corresp="#p_NK2"

                            his interests lie and make him aware he cannot indefinitely take one

                            regional cooperation is achieved. Remains to be seen how Nkrumah will
                            cooperate with these moderate forces which are inclined toward gradual
                            economic, cultural and educational approach to creation of an African
                            Community rather than schemes for immediate political unity. We would

                            messages had been sent to the British and other foreign governments. He
                            questioned the Ambassador as to the present status of this matter.</p>
                        <p>M. Alphand stated that an agreement would first have to be negotiated and
                            concluded between France and Guinea before the latter could be
                            considered independent. He assured that this would not take long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> pointed out that this
                            was a delicate matter, particularly in view of the possibility of
                            recognition of Guinea in the near future by the Soviets and other
                            governments. He, therefore, hoped that the French Government might
                            regularize the situation promptly and requested that we be kept closely
                            informed in this connection.</p>

                        <p>Couve de Murville said subject was thoroughly discussed in Quai meeting
                            this morning and that, while there has been and continues to be

                            receive and what they can expect later. French Govt does <pb n="673"

                            action which would give members of future community ground for feeling
                            they might have done better by voting “no.”</p>
                        <p>At this morning’s meeting it was decided that France would consult with
                            friendly govts, and particularly <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            ourselves, requesting us to postpone recognition for present. He trusts
                            the matter will be settled in about two or three weeks.</p>
                        <p>With respect to possible application for Guinea membership <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, he says he hopes we may keep in close
                            touch on this. In any event the matter would come soon before Security
                            Council “where it is more easily handled” and it would be better were
                            application made in middle of November (near end of <gloss

                        <p>It would be best of all, in his opinion, if application for membership
                            were made at next session as this would permit France to sponsor Guinea,
                            which she would like to do but does not feel she can do at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry as to whether it would not be possible to separate
                            question of recognition and future Franco-Guinean relations, he said
                            from French point of view two are closely allied and particularly in
                            minds of other territories.</p>
                        <p>He thoroughly realizes our embarrassment and appreciates attitude we have
                            taken so far and trusts we can delay at least few weeks more. Meanwhile
                            he trusts French, British and ourselves can keep in close touch on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my remark re number of countries recognizing, he rather
                            caustically said, “Yes, Soviet Union, Communist China, Egypt and
                            Yugoslavia.”</p>

                        <p>Return evening October 22 from Conakry having spent three and one-half
                            hours conversation with Sekou Toure and Minister of Interior Fodeba
                            Keita. Upon arrival airport met Cassell and Fernanadez, Liberian
                            visiting emissaries who showed great excitement over news Toure had
                            given them that US Government had recognized government Guinea and said
                            they had already cabled this to <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1"
                                >Tubman</persName>. I set Cassell straight immediately.</p>
                        <p>Toure said he regretted his people had incorrectly translated my telegram
                            of October 18 and appeared glum when I told him it might be impossible
                            avoid issue denial Washington if world press inquiries necessitated
                            statement by Department. Said he thoroughly understood and appreciated
                            American Government’s position of desire avoid misunderstanding with
                            France but emphasized great importance his government attached to
                            recognition by west in general and USA in particular. Spoke at great
                            length of cordial conversations with <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1"
                                >Tubman</persName>’s emissaries and although he had taken no action
                            yet he was prepared to enter dollar zone (or sterling) unless France
                            made some gesture to help Guinea by removing doubts in realm of trade
                            and commerce. I made special point of appealing to his realism by saying
                            quite apart from sentimental feelings of friendship of American peoples
                            towards his own, US Government wished Guinea success and hoped that
                            conditions would permit extension its recognition soon. At this point
                            our conversation interrupted by telephone call from Vice Consul Vanessen
                            at Dakar which led me to infer recognition by US Government might be
                            forthcoming soon. I conveyed this thought to Toure but nevertheless
                            asked him to give as little publicity as possible to his own <pb n="676"
                                xml:id="pg_676" facs="0706"/>message of reply to me dated October 19
                            and to get in touch with me before sending an emissary to US. This he
                            agreed to do (his message of October 19 was broadcast over Radio Conakry
                            and printed in Guinea press but no publicity to date has appeared in
                            Dakar news media) but without enthusiasm. He plans on sending <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Telli Diallo</persName> as Ambassador to US and
                            still wants him to leave for Washington within the next week. Camara, he
                            said, is now slated for Liberia and not London. Thus first diplomatic
                            missions would be Washington, Paris, and Monrovia. Said diplomatic
                            relations with Liberia important because of mutual interests in Nimba or
                            exploitation plus diamonds and forest products. Said he was very
                            impressed by Cassel and keen on establishing best possible relations
                            with Liberians. I must admit atmosphere was one of Guinean-Liberian
                            lovefest. Toure said small party had drunk champagne October 21 and had
                            photos taken celebrating recognition by US Government.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister made great point telling me Guinea’s basic interests lay
                            with the west and that East German delegation was still cooling heels at
                            Conakry. Said his first messages (of October 2) were addressed to West
                            and those to satellites sent 48 hours later. In short he pled for US
                            recognition. Although no specific request made he intimated Guinea later
                            on would desire economic assistance from America (I avoided any comment
                            on this subject).</p>
                        <p>View some of glib answers Toure had to problems of running post and
                            telegraph services, secondary school system et cetera without French and
                            naive idea he can jump into dollar or sterling zone overnight I stressed
                            following three points:</p>
                        <p>1. France had not imposed severe sanctions on Guinea (had not withdrawn
                            treasury advances, had not imposed French tariff on bananas or otherwise
                            inflicted <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment on Guinean
                            products). Therefore Prime Minister should endeavor ignore certain
                            unfriendly newspaper stories (e.g. Figaro) and patiently wait for acts
                            of recognition from western countries which would certainly be
                            forthcoming soon.</p>
                        <p>2. That US Government attached singular importance to continuation of
                            mutually profitable economic relations and friendly political
                            association between new African states and former mother countries and
                            that in this case both Guinea and France as well as west as a whole had
                            most to gain by creation and fostering best kind of post-independence
                            relations this regard.</p>
                        <p>3. That in presenting his case to western countries Prime Minister, view
                            his Marxist training, would hurt Guinea’s case by letting it appear he
                            was trying to blackmail west by raising spectre of Communist take-over
                            in Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Toure said he appreciated this candid counsel and in return for such
                            frankness said he personally would prefer not having anything to do with
                            East Germans for fear that after signing some kind of barter <pb n="677"
                                xml:id="pg_677" facs="0707"/>deal he might be left high and dry
                            whereas with the west he knew that good faith was basic ingredient of
                            any agreement. Nevertheless he felt in view of continued nonrecognition
                            by any western power to date, question of international prestige his
                            government was reacting a critical point and that slightest sign of
                            troubles (e.g. Soussou–Foulah tribal incidents) would be pounced upon by
                            certain elements French Government and elsewhere as proof his government
                            was not stable and hence did not merit recognition.</p>
                        <p>As for this translation my telegram to him of October 18 I have not [<hi
                                rend="italic">now</hi>] seen text and am furnishing it to Department
                            by despatch.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">Despatch 88 from Dakar, October
                                20. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 770B.02/10–2058)</note> Even
                            admitting their inaccurate rendition of “is giving due consideration” by
                            phrase “accordela consideration votlue”, the French translation could
                            not properly be considered as constituting recognition. Therefore
                            conclude that Toure thought there was enough warmth in message to
                            qualify inaccurate conclusion he drew and subsequent issuance text his
                            October 19 telegram to <hi rend="italic">Guinee Matin</hi> and Radio
                            Conakry. I told him that recognition, when it came, would be a message
                            emanating from the President of the US. As for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership I intimated to Prime Minister that it might
                            be technically difficult if not impossible to comply with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> procedures at this date so as to
                            accomplish Guinea’s membership this session. Toure said he very much
                            wanted it this session and smilingly hoped he could have US Government
                            also as sponsor.</p>
                        <p>Conclusions: 1. Economic life city Conakry subnormal perhaps but not
                            critical. Rumors of storage of rice and price soaring from 35 francs
                            September 14 to 180–200 today entirely without foundation. Price is 40
                            francs. (Messmer had promptly arranged for Belgian deal to furnish 4,000
                            tons which Houpouet had “hijacked” from the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>
                            at Abidjan.) Visited port and noticed three ships being loaded with
                            bananas and palm kernels.</p>
                        <p>2. Politically, Guinean populace appears quite calm. Leaders including
                            Toure acted rather tense, alternately between shy uncertainness to
                            bitterness and frustration. For example, as Minister Interior Fodeba
                            Keita, with whom I lunched, went into long explanation of how irritated
                            and supersensitive Guineans now were on political developments in
                            country and why he had felt obliged to expel a certain employee (named
                            Letten) of Guinee Matin who left Conakry last night on same plane with
                            me.</p>
                        <p>3. Liberian delegation which told me it was preparing the way for
                            Guinea’s acceptance by the west certainly went overboard in effusive
                            display of friendship. Believe this augurs well for future
                            Liberian-Guinean <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0708"/>relations and
                            although Cassell may have pushed things too far this may be unique case
                            in which Liberia has rendered signal service to US Government.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> asked regarding
                            the US attitude on the Guinea situation.<note n="1" xml:id="d311fn1"
                                >Lucet had conveyed the French position on Guinea to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> the previous day.
                                According to a memorandum of conversation, he said the French
                                considered that Guinea had “juridically speaking become a separate
                                entity” by its negative vote but that it was not capable of
                                exercising sovereignty. He said they did not object to U.S.
                                recognition of Guinea’s “new status” but hoped it would be qualified
                                rather than formal recognition as a fully sovereign state. It would
                                be “very premature” to consider establishment of diplomatic
                                relations or admission to the United Nations. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> replied that he did
                                not find the French position very clear. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ibid</hi>., 770B.00/10–2458)</note> The Secretary said this had
                            been simmering in his absence. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> said there was no question but that Guinea would
                            be independent and a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            but we did not wish to go too fast. Guinea will be separated from the
                            French Community and will have to be recognized. However, we should
                            study this problem and not rush diplomatic representation nor <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership. In response to the
                            Secretary’s question, <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said
                            France thought she would have to veto Guinea’s membership in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this year but would much prefer in the
                            Security Council to obtain five abstentions so that a veto would not be
                            required. He expressed the hope that the US would abstain the Security
                            Council if this matter arose and expressed the belief that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would abstain.</p>
                        <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0709"/>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the view that in the case of Guinea and others,
                            voting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership was really a
                            violation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> charter since these
                            states had demonstrated no capacity as required by the charter. The
                            result was the weakening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            However, he thought the present trend had gone so far that it was
                            questionable whether it could be reversed. <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> noted that all cases of admission of new states
                            in the past had taken a certain length of time noting the cases of
                            Libya, and the future case of Togo. Even Morocco and Tunisia had waited
                            until after the signature of the treaties of independence, an occurrence
                            which had not yet taken place in the case of Guinea. The conduct of
                            foreign affairs, defense, etc., had not yet been transferred to
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the British were somewhat worried over
                            non-recognition because of the effect in Ghana and elsewhere. The
                            Secretary added he had a basic sympathy with the French position but
                            noted that the precedents for delaying <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership were not good. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                            said he did not know when France would turn Guinea loose entirely, but
                            that the territories voting in favor of the French Community obviously
                            took precedence and that the whole question of the relationship of the
                            Community to Guinea must be developed. If the other territories believed
                            it was favored, they would be encouraged to follow the same course with
                            the resulting Balkanization of Black Africa, a development which would
                            be against the interests of the West as a whole.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea, in telegraphic messages to
                            you on October 2 and October 13, requested recognition by the United
                            States. The French Government has reluctantly given qualified
                            concurrence to the recognition of Guinea by powers friendly to France.
                            France urges that these powers refrain from establishing <pb n="680"
                                xml:id="pg_680" facs="0710"/>diplomatic relations with Guinea at
                            present. The French have also requested assistance in delaying Guinea’s
                            entry into the United Nations Organization.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that a telegram of recognition of Guinea as an independent
                            state will be sent to Prime Minister Sekou Toure by <persName
                                corresp="#p_MHS2">Harold Macmillan</persName> on Nov. 1.<note n="1"

                            message, I recommend that you authorize release of the text of the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that be believed
                            that all of the points raised in the Prime Minister’s letter had been
                            covered in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName>’s talk with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>. M. Diallo agreed, but
                            said that there was one important and delicate question which he had not
                            had time to discuss with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName>, namely, technical and financial assistance to
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that United States aid programs abroad must be
                            the subject of negotiation and agreement between the two parties. He
                            said that these are usually inaugurated by the sending of technical
                            missions on the part of either or both countries. He said that the
                            United States would be willing to take up the question of assistance to
                            Guinea at the appropriate time. He added that the United States is not
                            in a position to make any definite comment without knowing exactly what
                            Guinea has in mind. The Acting Secretary went on to say that the
                            Department would be glad to discuss specific requests but pointed out
                            that it was still far from clear what Guinea would continue to get from
                            France. He emphasized the fact that the United States hoped that Guinea
                            would continue to draw the major part of its economic assistance from
                            France.</p>
                        <p>M. Diallo said that Guinea was equally hopeful of continued French aid
                            but that the French attitude in the past two months has not been
                            encouraging. He said that Guinea had made many démarches without any
                            reply. He pointed out that Guinea’s need is now and that the young state
                            is going through difficult days with many unsolved problems and needs
                            concrete proof of United States good will.</p>
                        <p>M. Diallo went on to say that it was in the long-time interest of the
                            United States and the West in general to support the aspirations of the
                            African peoples for independence and unity. He said that Africa <pb
                                n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0712"/>needs the moral support of the
                            United States. He added that he was aware of the natural sympathy of the
                            American people towards emerging Africa, but he said he was afraid that
                            our alliances would serve as a brake on our assistance to the emerging
                            states of Africa. M. Diallo pointed out that it would be in the interest
                            of the United States and its Western allies to intervene with France and
                            point out to the French that the latter should guide rather than oppose
                            African independence.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary thanked M. Diallo for his frankness and complimented
                            him on the eloquence with which he had presented his views.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> said that he would
                            leave the question of economic and technical assistance to Guinea until
                            his return to this country in January or February. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> said that he believed that
                            this was a good idea since Guinea was at the moment in the process of
                            negotiating economic and technical aid agreements with France and
                            obviously this would have a bearing on Guinea’s external requirements.
                            He added, however, that if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> had time <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>

                                >Diallo</persName> replied that he did not have the time and
                            preferred to leave the matter in abeyance until his return.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> went on to say,
                            however, that he personally believed it essential that the United States
                            make some sort of gesture towards Guinea at an early date. He said that
                            he believed the most effective gesture would be an invitation to
                            President Toure to visit the United States. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> replied that unfortunately
                            state and official visits had to be planned long in advance and that at
                            the time the schedule of visits for 1959 was drawn up and no one in the
                            United States Government envisaged the early emergence of Guinea as an
                            independent state. For this reason, he said, there was absolutely no
                            possibility of a visit in 1959. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> replied that he understood this but that possibly
                            some sort of vaguely worded general invitation might be conveyed orally
                            to Mr. Toure with no date mentioned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FCVJ1"
                                >Ferguson</persName> said the Department would consider his
                            suggestion.</p>

                            branches are studying developments. However US military officials have
                            not dealt with the subject as a matter for immediate action. There have
                            been no meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff nor any Pentagon-State

                            <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> interpreted word “action”
                            to connote possibly military action and said this would create serious
                            repercussions in Conakry.</p>

                            represented views of US Government. Department doubted use of word

                            there is no military aspect to current US policies with respect to

                        <p>Department told <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> however
                            while US officials familiar with situation might be able understand

                            opinion were bound to interpret receipt of large number Czech arms as
                            contrary to interests American people and Free World. <persName

                        <p>Department will leave to your discretion best means of handling Times
                            story in Conakry but at some stage conversation with Toure himself would
                            seem warranted.<note n="1" xml:id="d315fn1">Rinden reported in airgram 2
                                from Conakry, April 10, that he had not discussed this with

                                “ruckus over the Czech arms” had been a “salutary lesson,” and
                                neither reassurances nor reiteration would be useful. Furthermore,
                                he commented, because of Toure’s resentment of the delay in U.S.
                                recognition, establishment of diplomatic relations, and appointment
                                of an ambasssador, and the disappointment of his “apparent
                                expectation” that the United States would hasten to compete with the
                                Soviet Union in offering economic aid to Guinea, “U.S. diplomatists
                                are not in a very graceful position when it comes to volunteering

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> opened the
                            conversation by explaining that he hoped to initiate his mission to
                                Washington<note n="1" xml:id="d316fn1">
                                <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> was to present his
                                credentials to the President on April 27.</note> in a spirit of
                            friendship and cooperation, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> replied that the Department was conscious of its
                            good relations with Guinea and assuredly would cooperate with the
                            Ambassador. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> explained
                            that the Department’s position should be clear and that it consisted of
                            a desire to have close ties with Guinea, whose problems it understood
                            and whose needs it intended to consider sympathetically. The Ambassador
                            then pointed out the financial and personnel difficulties standing in
                            the way of the establishment and staffing of a Guinean Embassy in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> set forth the
                            guiding lines of Guinea’s policy, which he described as based on a
                            consciousness of Guinea’s ties with the West and appreciation for
                            Western culture. He pleaded for direct contacts between Guinea and the
                            United States so that the latter country would not be prejudiced by the
                            opinions of Guinea held by third countries. He added that Guinea will
                            never intentionally take action to damage its relations with the United
                            States, but that Guinea might be the victim of attempts by other nations
                            to separate it from its Western friends. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> replied that, as an independent country, Guinea
                            would be dealt with directly by the United States, that the United
                            States intended to be frank in its dealings with Guinea and that we
                            would not hesitate to question Guinea whenever doubts arose which
                            affected our relations with it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> said that such a doubt
                            had already arisen in connection with the Czech arms deliveries to
                            Conakry. While professing to understand the reason for acquiring a
                            certain quantity of arms, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> wondered at the circumstances which had caused
                            such a large quantity of arms to arrive in Guinea at the same time as
                            Communist <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0716"/>bloc specialists and
                            a Soviet diplomatic mission. He requested an explanation. The Ambassador
                            referred to his press conference at the United Nations on March 18, and
                            explained that Guinea had never requested arms of Czechoslovakia. Guinea
                            had, he explained, made general requests for assistance for all nations
                            in a position to offer it, and Czechoslovakia had come forward with
                            arms. The Ambassador further explained that, although Guinea has an army
                            of 2,000 soldiers and has 13,000 demobilized former French Army
                            soldiers, it has no fear of attack nor projects for disturbing its
                            neighbors. The acceptance of the arms, according to him, did not
                            symbolize Guinea’s capitulation to any political terms which the
                            Communist bloc countries might have in mind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> expressed surprise that
                            Czechoslovakia had sent arms without first obtaining the agreement of
                            Guinea or even showing the Guinea Government an inventory list. The
                            Ambassador replied to this that Guinea’s trouble arose in part from a
                            blatant French campaign to discredit Guinea in the eyes of the world.
                            The discussion then passed to the reasons for the lack of fulfillment of
                            the three protocols of association signed between France and Guinea on
                            January 7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> denied
                            French statements that Guinea was reluctant to sign conventions with
                            France, pointing out that Guinea needs French aid for many reasons and
                            is basically well-disposed towards France. The Ambassador explained the
                            French attitude towards Guinea as springing from a serious dilemma. In
                            effect if Guinea succeeds in making independence work, it will act as a
                            pole of attraction for states presently in the French community. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> asked what benefit
                            France might gain from Guinea’s present difficult situation, to which
                            the Ambassador replied that Guinea would become an object lesson to the
                            states of the Community, in addition to which the French undoubtedly
                            hope that a successor government to Sekou Toure’s could be enticed back
                            into the Community. For this reason, the Ambassador said, France is
                            pursuing a conscious policy of sapping Guinea’s strength and attempting
                            to suppress Guinea in the international arena. The Ambassador complained
                            that although Guinea asked France for permission to remain in the franc
                            zone and offered the French buildings in Conakry for their Embassy, the
                            French have not so much as shown the courtesy of helping the Guinean
                            Ambassador in Paris to find decent office space. For this reason, the
                            Guinea Government was convinced that France was working for Sekou
                            Toure’s downfall. The Ambassador added that becuase of the withdrawal by
                            France of its two-billion-franc 1958 treasury advance, Guinea did not
                            have the funds to open its Embassy in Washington. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> said that in their precipitate
                            departure the French had stripped the country of many essential items
                            such as medical supplies.</p>
                        <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0717"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> then asked the
                            Ambassador how long he would remain away from Washington,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d316fn2">After presenting his credentials, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> was to return temporarily to
                                Conakry.</note> but the Ambassador’s reply was vague. It appeared
                            that he would be gone at least 3–6 weeks and possibly longer.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> then mentioned
                            his country’s need for United States assistance, stressing that an
                            immediate program constituting a gesture and an indication of United
                            States support was vastly preferable to a large aid program which might
                            be several months in the planning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName> replied that the Agricultural Attaché at
                            Monrovia had been sent to study Guinea’s immediate food needs and that
                            further studies of Guinea’s needs would be made as rapidly as possible.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> reminded the
                            Ambassador that Guinea had not asked for precise and well-defined United
                            States aid.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Ambassador again pleaded for United States
                            understanding of Guinea and its problems and asked if there were any
                            questions remaining in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                            >Murphy</persName>’s mind concerning Guinea’s policies. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> thanked the Ambassador for his
                            visit and asked him to explain to President Toure that the Department
                            would be pleased to make contact with the President should he decide to
                            pay a visit to the United Nations General Assembly next fall.</p>

                        <p>Recent developments in the relations of Guinea and the Soviet bloc
                            countries are causing serious concern. Since September 28, 1958, when
                            Guinea attained independence by her vote in the French referendum, the
                            Soviet Union and bloc countries have been actively wooing her by the
                            signing of trade, cultural and educational agreements. This has
                            culminated in a Czech arms gift and the assignment of Soviet, Bulgarian
                            and Czech representatives in Guinea.</p>

                        <p>Because of conditions in Guinea, President Sekou Toure was forced to

                            President Toure has, through his Ambassador-designate, indicated his
                            intention to visit the United Nations General Assembly during its next
                            session in September of this year. I believe that the extension of an
                            invitation from you to President Toure for an official visit to the
                            United States at the same time would be most effective in counteracting
                            the rapidly developing communist influence in Guinea.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that President Toure be invited to spend three days in
                            Washington at the President’s Guest House and be a guest of the
                            Government for an additional week for visiting other parts of the United
                            States. I believe that you will be involved personally to the extent of
                            meeting President Toure at the Airport, if his visit occurs during the
                            appropriate months, serving as host at a luncheon during his first full
                            day in Washington, and possibly receiving President Toure for an office
                            call at the White House during the visit. If it is your wish, Sekou
                            Toure would be advised that it is not necessary for him to give a return
                            luncheon or dinner for you.</p>
                        <p>I also recommend that, if convenient, your official airplane be made
                            available to transport President Toure from New York City to Washington
                            on arrival and that you request the Secretary of Defense to furnish
                            suitable aircraft for the transportation of the President and his party
                            within the continental United States on a non-reimbursable basis, as

                            believe that a most favorable psychological impact would be produced
                            within the Government of Guinea if, on that occasion, you were able to

                        <p>Both Bob Murphy and I feel that in the category of official visits this

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> outlined French
                            concern with regard to recent events in Guinea, including deliveries of
                            arms, medicines and non-military supplies from the Communist Bloc. He
                            indicated that the French were worried about the effects of these
                            deliveries on one of the few remaining parts of the world still
                            disarmed. The Ambassador pointed out that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> had told him that Guinea did not
                            request the Czech arms, does not need them, and cannot use them.
                            Continuing by saying that this highly dangerous situation results from
                                <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0720"/>a design of the Communist
                            Bloc to build a depot in Guinea, the Ambassador indicated that French
                            legal experts were studying the possibility of stopping further arms
                            shipments. However, in his opinion, the problem was more political than
                            legal and required the sounding of a general alarm by Guinea’s African
                            neighbors. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> suggested that
                            if Liberia were to react publicly against the arms deliveries, the
                            Community, Sierra Leone, the Portuguese and even the United States could
                            join the outcry and this could be the beginning of an international
                            convention preventing the flow of arms to Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that Liberia would be unwilling to issue a public statement. He also
                            indicated that the Department’s Legal Adviser had found no legal ground
                            for preventing the arms deliveries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> asked if we were certain that arms had arrived in
                            considerable quantities. [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> stated that
                            British alarm was less over the size of the arms deliveries than over
                            the presence of Czech instructors and technicians which the West should
                            attempt at all cost to dislodge. He placed the presence of the Communist
                            personnel ahead of the actual arms as the primary danger. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> voiced the fear that we may see
                            the beginning of an arms race in Africa because of the peculiar appeal
                            which armament has to newly independent nations.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of Guinean charges that France had removed so
                            much equipment from Guinea that the country was in urgent need of
                            supplies from every source. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> indicated that France had tried to help Guinea
                            since its independence but that Guinea had refused all French offers.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> concluded that the
                            first thing for the West to do in this situation was to send a competent
                            ambassador or ambassadors to Conakry without delay in order to obtain
                            badly needed information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> stated that France will
                            not now send an ambassador and preferred that the U.S. also not send
                            one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> asked what the
                            French reasoning was behind this decision adding that an ambassador is
                            nothing more than a business representative and that the real decision
                            concerning relations with Guinea was taken at the time the Western
                            powers recognized that country. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> said that France did not like the attitude shown
                            by the Guinea Government and that with or without Western ambassadors
                            the problems with Guinea remain as acute. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> asked if this meant the French
                            wished to leave Guinea to the Soviets, adding that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> and the Guinea Government have
                            strong feelings that France is abandoning Guinea by refusing to
                            implement the protocols of January 7. He asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> what President Toure must think
                            when the Communist Bloc is sending ambassadors and the Western nations
                            not. He asked if the French attitude was calculated to improve President
                            Toure’s attitude <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0721"/>toward the
                            West. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> replied that
                            nothing the West does can improve the President’s attitude, and that
                            France does not wish to honor the Guineans by sending an ambassador but
                            desires only to stop the arms deliveries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Caccia</persName> stated that
                            British legal experts doubted that the arms could legally be stopped,
                            except under certain circumstances if aboard Western ships or in French
                            Community territorial waters. Therefore, Britain could not support a
                            seizure of the arms. The Ambassador went on to ask if anyone knew the
                            real size or threat of the arms. He said that public statements by
                            African Governments could be extremely damaging if the quantity of arms
                            turned out to be small. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1"
                                >Caccia</persName> added that, as for accrediting a British
                            ambassador to Conakry, it has already proposed to President Toure that
                            Ambassador Clarke in Monrovia be accredited to Conakry as well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> regretted that no
                            Western power has yet discussed the arms matter with President Toure,
                            adding that normally one would expect to discuss a matter of this
                            importance with a friendly government before making a public outcry
                            against that government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> added that the latter course could lead to a
                            damaging public debate, with President Toure making countercharges
                            against his attackers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> pressed his request
                            that the Department approach President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1"
                                >Tubman</persName> and that the British approach Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> voiced his great concern over
                            possible public statements from these statesmen. However, it was agreed
                            that approaches would be made.<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">Telegram 295

                                >Satterthwaite</persName>. Thanks to joint efforts Rinden and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> I found on my
                            arrival here yesterday an exceptional cordial atmosphere toward US as
                            indicated by fact President Sekou Toure and members government have
                            given me a very cordial reception. I had an hour with him and leading
                            members his government last night followed by dinner with Foreign
                            Minister Fode, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName>. This morning Rinden
                            and I had an hour with Sekou Toure at which Legislative Assembly
                            President Diallo Saifoulaye was only other person present.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday President spoke very bitterly of manner in which French left
                            here (taking everything possible including arms from security forces
                            with them) and of subsequent French intrigues to overthrow his
                            government. He spoke with pride of impressive progress his government
                            has made in spite the difficulties in both political and economic fields
                            since independence.</p>
                        <p>This morning President discussed first role of French in Guinea and its
                            interest and between Guinea and US in the development of our relations
                            with Guinea; of the political and economic situation in Guinea and of
                            what he called “the mystic” of Union of Black African States which he
                            thought might spread to other African States later.</p>
                        <p>As of incidental interest he said that only visit he had made behind Iron
                            Curtain was one to Warsaw of about four days in 1950 or 1951 of which
                            French had full knowledge. On question of Czech arms he reiterated that
                            Guinea had not asked for these arms and said that maximum number of
                            rifles was between 2500 and 3000.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned in latter connection the confusion about his request to US
                            for arms made through President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1"
                                >Tubman</persName> of Liberia. I said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWVS1">Tubman</persName> had sincerely desired help
                            Guinea in this matter and should not be criticized in any way for any
                            misunderstandings which arose later.<note n="1" xml:id="d319fn1"

                        <p>President Sekou Toure’s forthcoming trip to Washington (October 26–28)
                            provides a unique opportunity to exert a moderating influence on the
                            future course of Guinea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Importance of Guinea to U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>In the year since Guinea’s independence, the country has assumed a
                            critical importance among all the French-speaking areas of West and
                            Equatorial Africa. Because Guinea accepted General de Gaulle’s challenge
                            and voted for independence, its experiment is being closely watched by
                            all its French-speaking neighbors. If it seems to be succeeding, it will
                            almost certainly act as a magnet to the surrounding area.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, if the Soviet Bloc is able to achieve a dominant position
                            there, it will undoubtedly use Guinea as a bridgehead for expanding its
                            influence throughout West Africa.</p>
                        <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0724"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Bloc Penetration</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Bloc appears to be making an all-out effort to capitalize on
                            the present situation in Guinea. So far five Bloc nations have concluded
                            bilateral trade agreements, theoretically committing a third of the
                            country’s trade. Some 150 Bloc technicians have replaced French
                            officials so that the key officers in many vital ministries are from
                            Eastern Europe: i.e., Radio Conakry, which in the absence of daily
                            newspapers is the principal information medium in the country, is being
                            operated by Czech technicians and the leading advisers of both the
                            Ministries of Defense and Mines are also from behind the Iron Curtain.
                            Recently the Soviets have offered a 35 million dollar loan.</p>
                        <p>Although we believe President Toure is trying to maintain a neutral
                            policy, there are members of his government who reportedly are trying to
                            push him to the left. Saifoulaye Diallo, for example, who concluded the
                            negotiations for the Soviet loan, may develop into a potential rival of
                            Sekou Toure if he is able to represent the Soviet Union as the real
                            supporter of African nationalism, as opposed to the United States which
                            delayed recognition of Guinea and has produced comparatively little aid.
                            The recent Congress of the <gloss target="#t_PDG1">PDG</gloss>, the only
                            political party in Guinea, was attended by official delegations from the
                            Soviet Communist Party and the parties of other satellites and
                            represented the high-water mark so far of Bloc influence in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>An indication of President Toure’s determination to maintain a neutral
                            course is his choice of the United States for his first official trip
                            outside Africa. Our Embassy in Conakry reports, however, that if he is
                            unable to show that, as a result of this visit, the United States is as
                            firm a supporter of Guinea as the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            his dominant position in the ruling hierarchy may be threatened by those
                            further to the left.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. United States Objectives</p>
                        <p>(1) Our principal objective in Guinea is to maintain the presence of the
                            United States and the West in the country and to establish a position
                            for future United States action to stem the flood of expanding Soviet
                            influence and reinforce our own influence when this flood recedes.</p>
                        <p>(2) Also we believe that while Toure cannot be considered wholly
                            satisfactory from the West’s point of view, he nevertheless represents a
                            stable element strongly committed to neutrality and, as such, is worthy
                            of our support. Only with this support will he be able to oppose extreme
                            leftist opposition now developing within the Party and be influenced
                            toward a position more truly in Guinea’s (and our own) best
                            interests.</p>

                                program might be feasible; he indicated that he did not know how
                                long Guinea would have to wait for a policy decision on U.S. aid,
                                but he believed <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> could

                            given to presenting an aircraft to Sekou Toure during his visit. <gloss

                            plane in good condition, plus spare parts, can be obtained for
                            $80-100,000 and another $100,000 or more would have to be spent to
                            change it to an executive configuration. In addition, it is estimated it
                            will cost approximately $10,000 to ferry the plane from the United
                            States to Guinea. The former Chargé in Conakry reports that the Guinean
                            Government could probably provide its own crew and maintenance
                            facilities. There are precedents for such a gesture in the Coast Guard

                        <p>After an exchange of greetings President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> noted that Guinea had acquired its
                            independence by peaceful means. It would however be unrealistic, he
                            added, to expect the United States to interfere in those countries which
                            are not yet independent. But in those countries which are independent we
                            want to be helpful. Furthermore we deplore any actions which make
                            Guinean problems more difficult.</p>
                        <p>The President reviewed the history of our relations with the Philippine
                            Islands, pointing out that in the very early days of our occupation we
                            made it clear to the Philippine leaders that it was our intention to
                            prepare the Philippine people for independence. He himself, working
                            under General MacArthur, had been given the task of organizing a
                            Philippine Army. He also recalled that when the Soviet Union some years
                            ago had described the United States as a colonial power because of its
                            relationships with Puerto Rico, he had instructed our chief delegate at
                            the United Nations to make it clear that Puerto Rico could have its
                            independence any time it wished it. Puerto Rico however said no. The
                            President also referred to the fact that we had been instrumental in
                            helping Cuba acquire its independence.</p>
                        <p>Thus our own history of independence and of giving independence to
                            others, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            continued, makes it evident that we do not believe in dominating any
                            other peoples. At the same time, however, we cannot stir up unrest in
                            Africa or elsewhere. Nevertheless he wished to make it clear that the
                            United States welcomes the emergence of independent states and is happy
                            to welcome Guinea as the newest of such states. We desire to be helpful.
                            In this connection he recalled that we ourselves were once a colony.</p>
                        <p>The President then noted that education usually has the first priority in
                            new nations. He thereupon congratulated President Sekou Touré on his
                            considerable accomplishments in this field since acquiring independence,
                            especially his success in building new schools. He was, he continued,
                            particularly delighted by the visit of President Sekou Touré and his
                            party to this country. Our relations with Guinea will, he said, be
                            direct and not influenced by third parties. At the same time, he added,
                            we expect that Guinea likewise will not be influenced by third parties
                            in its relations with the United States. He then told President Sekou
                            Touré he would listen with great interest to whatever he might wish to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>In replying to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>, President Sekou Touré said that he hoped
                            that the present lack of knowledge and understanding of Africa would
                            soon be replaced by a fuller knowledge of that continent. Such progress
                            as has been made in Guinea, he continued, is due <pb n="700"
                                xml:id="pg_700" facs="0730"/>to the simplicity and the honesty in
                            the relations between the people of Guinea and its leaders. Referring to
                            the referendum of September of last year, the people of Guinea voted
                            “no”, he said, not just for Guinea but for all of Africa. This has been
                            borne out, he stated, by the fact that virtually all those who voted
                            “yes” at that time now want their independence. This, he said, is
                            because by independence they mean confidence in themselves. Their real
                            treasure lies in their honesty and in their will to work.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, he said, the Guineans have been completely frank with the
                            French and the latter know exactly how the Guineans feel toward them.
                            The French created many difficulties for the Guineans, ordering all
                            their security forces, their teachers and technicians, in sum all of the
                            French officials and advisers, back to France immediately. Moreover, the
                            French removed from Conakry all their records including those of the
                            courts. All this action was difficult enough but more important were the
                            French efforts to ruin the economy of Guinea. Notwithstanding all this
                            they had, as President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            remarked, made progress and had also acquired many friends around the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>President Sekou Touré said they thereupon had to search for means to help
                            themselves. Missions were shortly thereafter received from the Eastern
                            countries who offered their help. Indeed so dire was their need that
                            they would have accepted help from the devil himself at that juncture.
                            These missions from the Eastern countries offered them barter
                            arrangements of a type which they were able to accept. They also sent
                            some 2500 rifles, three tanks, six tractors, a number of field kitchens
                            and several thousand steel plows, all of which were given Guinea without
                            their having made a request for them of any kind either orally or in
                            writing.</p>
                        <p>The one country of which they did make a request, President Sekou Touré
                            added, was the United States through President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWVS1">Tubman</persName>. Although they approached
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1">Tubman</persName> several times
                            they did not receive a favorable answer from the United States to their
                            request for small arms for their security forces. They worked through
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TWVS1">Tubman</persName> because
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> was not in the
                            country at that time. (Note: President Sekou Touré was in error at this
                            remark as <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Telli Diallo</persName>, who was
                            later named Ambassador, was in the United States at least part of this
                            period.) Moreover, President Sekou Touré added, the French were at this
                            time introducing automatic weapons into the country surreptitiously and
                            getting them into the hands of their former soldiers. In fact, he said,
                            they had seized about a thousand of such arms. On this President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> smilingly remarked
                            that this at least meant they were receiving arms for their security
                            forces in this way.</p>
                        <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0731"/>
                        <p>President Sekou Touré thereafter made the following comments: English has
                            now been made compulsory in all their schools. Guinea continues to aid
                            all countries seeking their independence. The French had nothing to fear
                            from Guinea in the economic and cultural fields and could well have
                            helped Guinea. All Africans are seeking their independence but the
                            French are doing everything to prevent them from obtaining it.</p>
                        <p>President Sekou Touré then spoke with considerable eloquence of the
                            greatness of the African continent and of its need for moral and
                            spiritual, as well as material, aid. Guinea, he said, felt that it must
                            aid in solving all these problems. Moreover all the other continents
                            except Africa are now free. Africa is nevertheless obtaining its
                            independence at the rate of four to six countries per year. He thought
                            it would be in the best interests of the United States to aid all these
                            countries on a continental rather than a piece-meal basis. Africa will
                            inevitably move on to its final liberation. The measure in which the
                            United States can adapt its policies to help Africa will redound to the
                            credit of the United States. The only real concern of his visit is to
                            make this understood.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> thereupon
                            said that he would like to make one or two more comments. He mentioned a
                            dinner which he had attended recently in Paris at which were present the
                            Prime Ministers of the member states of the French Community.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d322fn2">On September 2.</note> These Prime Ministers had
                            told him that they had decided to remain in the Community. At the same
                            time they had not criticized Guinea for not doing so. They felt that it
                            was in the best interests of their countries not to create trade
                            barriers but rather to continue to enjoy the advantages which the
                            Community gave them. At the same time they mentioned the fact that the
                            constitution of the Community still gave them the opportunity to choose
                            independence. One of the Prime Ministers had indeed hinted that his
                            state would probably so choose. The others indicated that they would
                            remain in the Community. If and when they do decide for independence,
                            the United States will try to be helpful to them.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> with great
                            feeling then said that our belief in the brotherhood of man and our
                            religious beliefs strengthen us in this faith. We will not violate our
                            own traditions. Any and every problem presented to us by the new
                            countries of Africa will be considered sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>In closing the conversation President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> commented that he had been very interested
                            indeed in hearing President Sekou Toure’s remarks and of learning
                            something of the needs of Guinea and of its domestic problems. He was
                            confident that in the further conversations in the State Department
                            these would be spelled out in greater detail <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702"
                                facs="0732"/>and over a period of time during which they may wish to
                            send some people here and we some to Guinea. It would, he said, be a
                            privilege and not a burden for us to do all we could to help Guinea.
                            Whereupon the interview, having lasted for an hour, was broken off at
                            the Secretary’s suggestion by the taking of photographs.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary welcomed President Toure and asked him to open the
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>President Toure began by describing the main purpose of his visit to the
                            United States as “moral and political;” Guinea’s independence would
                            constitute a springboard for the “achievement of the African peoples”
                            personality and the rehabilitation of their culture.” Whatever our
                            faults may be, our people have great moral integrity, he declared, and
                            we are faithful to Africa.</p>
                        <p>There can be no quarrel, the President declared, between such advanced
                            nations as the United States and the undeveloped countries of Africa.
                            Moreover, the problems of Africa are interlocking and one problem cannot
                            be considered in isolation from all the others. Since the United States
                            is able to contribute a great deal to humanity, it has an equally great
                            responsibility. Any plan for the economic development <pb n="703"
                                xml:id="pg_703" facs="0733"/>and emancipation of Africa must aim at
                            giving the African people a sense of security and confidence. The sooner
                            Africans realize that they can rightfully count on assistance, the more
                            they will accept sacrifices on their own part since their future
                            security would be assured.</p>
                        <p>Sekou Toure urged the United States to adapt its policies to the new
                            realities in Africa. This did not mean that he wanted the United States
                            to declare war on the colonial powers; he would, however, ask that our
                            consideration of African problems not be subordinated to the views of
                            colonial powers since colonialism is outdated.</p>
                        <p>As far as Guinea is concerned, President Toure declared that its regime
                            is neutral. It might be argued that there is no such thing as neutrality
                            and that everyone must belong to one bloc or the other. This, Toure
                            judged, is both true and false at the same time. It is true if you
                            consider Africans to be self-sufficient. But this is not the case;
                            one-third of the continent is underfed and lacks basic, elementary needs
                            such as medicine, tools or ploughs. On the human level, Africans are
                            motivated by an irresistible force so that they do not stop to ask why
                            they lack these basic needs; all they know is that they are relentlessly
                            driven to satisfy such needs.</p>
                        <p>Guinea and the rest of Africa are in favor of fraternal cooperation with
                            all nations. They want it understood that the present situation in
                            Africa requires more than a piecemeal attack on isolated problems. Such
                            developed countries as the United States should do more than just
                            concentrate on a single school building in Conakry or a dam somewhere
                            else. We ask for a dynamic American policy, Toure declared, affirming
                            its determination to help all the undeveloped countries of the world and
                            especially Africa. Security for invested capital and reasonable profits
                            should go hand in hand with a sense of security and confidence in these
                            investments on the part of the African people.</p>
                        <p>Sekou Toure concluded by referring to Guinea’s counter proposals to the
                            draft technical cooperation agreement which were given to the United
                            States Embassy in Conakry.<note n="1" xml:id="d323fn1">Telegram 124 from
                                Conakry, October 19, reported a discussion with Guinean officials
                                that day concerning a proposed technical cooperation agreement. The
                                Guineans stated that they considered the terms of the U.S. proposal
                                too restrictive and presented a counterproposal for a more general
                                agreement including cultural and commercial relations. (<hi

                            declared that an agreement on cultural relations between the two
                            countries should be concluded within the framework of Guinea’s position
                            as outlined above.</p>
                        <p>In reply, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            acknowledged the United States’ responsibility to the rest of the world
                            and referred to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>’s recent speech in Abilene, Texas [<hi

                                xml:id="pg_704" facs="0734"/>that it was a privilege for us to

                                1959</hi>, pp. 719–725.</note> The Secretary mentioned that Toure’s
                            intimation that these talks might exceed the limits of U.S.-Guinean
                            relations was somewhat beyond our scope. Nevertheless, he wanted to
                            affirm that President Toure’s moral position on African problems was
                            very similar to that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the technical cooperation agreement with Guinea, the
                            Secretary observed that it was broad in scope and covered the technical
                            and economic fields in general terms. With regard to the cultural pact,
                            the Secretary expressed hope that agreement on this matter would be
                            reached that same day or the next, so that it could be signed while
                            President Toure was still in Washington. Sekou Toure affirmed that his
                            Government accepted the terms of the cultural agreement and was ready to
                                sign.<note n="3" xml:id="d323fn3">For text of the agreement signed

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary then broached the subject of an economic agreement which
                            would provide for the protection of private investments and assistance
                            to be granted by the United States Government. He noted that the United
                            States is required by law to operate on a project-by-project basis and
                            cannot enter into a world-wide assistance program. The Secretary also
                            reminded President Toure that our legislation prohibits the U.S. from
                            committing itself to projects of more than one year’s duration and that,
                            consequently, United States foreign assistance has to be implemented on
                            a year-to-year basis. The Secretary then turned over the meeting to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>President Toure said he wished to clarify his previous statement, which
                            he believed may not have been fully understood. Guinea is not seeking a
                            written political agreement with the United States nor is it seeking a
                            formal declaration of U.S. intentions with regard to Africa. The main
                            points the President wished to convey were: (1) the African need for
                            moral and diplomatic support from the United States, and (2) the need to
                            situate the moral context of these talks so as to reach a firm agreement
                            which would cover not merely the present but also problems likely to
                            arise in the future. Sekou Toure gave a concrete example of the kind of
                            support he had in mind: during the first difficult months after
                            independence, the Government of Guinea had kept a close eye on any
                            factors which might have curtailed its newly-acquired sovereignty. The
                            Guineans were aware, for example, that France had discussed the problem
                            of Guinea’s independence with its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            partners and was considering occupying by force the islands of Los
                            (situated just outside Conakry). The French would have tried to justify
                            such a <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0735"/>move on the grounds that
                            these islands were not part of continental Guinea. According to Toure,
                            his Government had been informed that, thanks to United States pressure
                            on the French, this plan did not materialize. “This fact is known by
                            every single Guinean,” the President asserted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> replied that President
                            Toure’s remarks had been most useful in helping the United States to
                            understand the general situation in Africa. Broaching specific matters,
                            he asked President Toure for a clarification of Guinea’s economic
                            position vis-à-vis France. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2"
                                >Murphy</persName> said that he understood that this matter had been
                            discussed generally with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that morning but that President Toure’s

                            and France would be helpful to the United States Government in
                            evaluating its own program to assist Guinea.</p>
                        <p>President Toure replied that Guinea was going through a period of
                            “creativity” which was made possible by the advent of independence.
                            Important steps had been taken in many fields to exercise full national
                            sovereignty. In the economic field, before independence, France had all
                            the privileges and especially had held close to all functions connected
                            with imports and exports, while Africans were excluded from most
                            economic activities. Following independence, the Government of Guinea
                            had created a National Office of Foreign Trade which was made a part of
                            the Ministry of Economy. This Office is responsible for implementing
                            trade agreements with other countries and insuring a balanced flow of
                            imports and exports. Before independence, practically all of Guinea’s
                            exports had been shipped to France; since then, France has refused to
                            buy Guinea’s coffee and banana crop which are the country’s most
                            important exports. Consequently, Guinea has made barter agreements with
                            Czechoslovakia, East Germany (and West Germany), Bulgaria, Poland and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. With the latter country only
                            coffee and palm products are involved. Guinea also trades with Italy,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the U.S. Although it may not
                            appear to be sound economics, Guinea, in its early steps towards
                            independence, preferred to resort to barter arrangements in order to
                            tailor its imports to its exports. These barter arrangements can be
                            either entirely or partially fulfilled or even cancelled. President
                            Toure revealed that next year Guinea also plans to initiate its first
                            three-year plan which is designed to develop all sectors of the economy.
                            This plan will be established on the basis of thorough studies and sound
                            statistics. Foreign investments are welcome either in a majority or in a
                            minority participation, and security and profits will be insured.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> thanked the President
                            for this information and asked him the following specific questions:</p>
                        <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0736"/>
                        <p>1. Are Guinea’s barter arrangements, presently in force, confined to a
                            specific time limit? President Toure replied that these arrangements are
                            limited only in quantity, not in duration.</p>
                        <p>2. How does Guinea visualize the position of the United States vis-à-vis
                            the National Office of Foreign Trade? Will this office authorize trade
                            with the United States following a certain formula? Toure replied that
                            it would. During the first eight months of 1959, Guinea’s exports to the
                            United States had totalled approximately $185,000 and imports from the
                            United States about $1.6 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> pointed out that, while
                            he understood Guinea’s need to barter, this posed a difficult problem
                            for the United States since we were not authorized by law to enter into
                            barter agreements. However, the U.S. is ready to discuss a trade
                            agreement with Guinea at any time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> at this point
                            stated that in order to satisfy President Toure’s need for a concrete
                            gesture on our part, the United States Government was prepared to offer
                            Guinea 150 scholarships. These scholarships are to be part of the
                            technical cooperation agreement now being negotiated and would be
                            granted as soon as this agreement was signed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> invited President
                            Toure’s attention to the facilities of the Export-Import Bank and the
                            Development Loan Fund in considering Guinea’s need for loans for
                            specific projects.</p>
                        <p>As President Toure had to leave for the National Press Club, the talks
                            were suspended. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Murphy</persName> and
                            President Toure agreed to meet the following morning for the signing of
                            the cultural agreement. It was further agreed that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FCVJ1">Ferguson</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> would work out a joint press
                            communiqué.</p>

                        <p>Recent reports from our Embassy in Conakry have made it abundantly clear
                            that we will not be able to negotiate a Technical Cooperation Agreement
                            with Guinea in sufficient time to begin to implement the Teacher
                            Training Program and the 150 scholarships we have offered. The Guineans
                            have made it plain that they do not like anything about our proposed
                            Technical Cooperation Agreement. They find the whole concept of our
                            requesting rights and privileges for <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            technicians most offensive since they believe it is the role of a
                            sovereign government to prescribe what privileges will be accorded. It
                            is also clear that the Sino-Soviet Bloc has stepped up the pace of its
                            activity in a very dramatic fashion and is determined to make Guinea an
                            African show place.</p>
                        <p>I believe it has now become of overriding political importance for the
                            United States to take unusual steps to implement the offers of
                            assistance we have already made to Guinea in order to establish U.S.
                            presence in Guinea. In view of the already massive assistance Guinea is
                            getting from the bloc it is clearly in the U.S. political interest to
                            extend to Guinea, on a special basis, assistance in which it has shown
                            an interest. I recognize the fact that we may be setting a precedent for
                            other emerging nations of Africa but in view of the special
                            circumstances we face in Guinea I believe this is a risk we must face. I
                            regard it as essential that Guinea not be required to agree to any of
                            the usual requirements normally attached to U.S. assistance, such as
                            privileges and immunities, observation and review, publicity, etc.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I suggest that we proceed on the basis of a simple exchange
                            of notes with the Guinean Government informing it that we are prepared
                            to implement the teacher training program and the 150 scholarships.<note

                            Executive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W.
                                Boggs</persName>, dated March 14, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that the recent actions of
                            Guinea highlighted the drift of that country toward closer relations
                            with the Sino-Soviet Bloc. The recognition of East Germany and the
                            probable taking of similar action with respect to North Vietnam
                            reflected Sekou Toure’s willingness to do business with the Bloc.
                            Guinea’s recent withdrawal from the franc zone, reflecting a mistrust of
                            Paris, resulted in considerable confusion. The currency for the new
                            monetary system was probably printed in Czechoslovakia. The Three Year
                            Economic Plan of Guinea had a strong socialist flavor, with the state
                            exercising a virtual monopoly over trade and industrial development. Six
                            Soviet Bloc nations were, or were about to be, represented in Guinea;
                            Bloc economic and technical assistance in Guinea surpasses that for any
                            other African state; and Guinea has a great deal of barter trade with
                            the Bloc. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles have about 100 advisors in
                            Guinea and there are about 100 Guinean students behind the Iron Curtain.
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt the Bloc was attempting to make
                            Guinea a showcase in Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> reported that the U.S. had been trying to
                            conclude a technical assistance agreement with Guinea, but had been
                            unsuccessful because Guinea refused to allow U.S. technicians sent to
                            that country any privileges. Apparently the Czech technicians in Guinea
                            lived in barracks and marched to work like soldiers. Guinea thought the
                            U.S. technicians should behave in the same way.” (Eisenhower Library,

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> informed the
                            Acting Secretary that Guinea appealed to all nations for aid. There is
                            no need to waste time surveying the country’s requirements, he said,
                            since Guinea needs everything. The Ambassador observed that he was aware
                            of procedural difficulties which had hampered U.S. action in the past
                            but strongly urged reconsideration of Guinea’s needs. His country
                            considers American aid essential because if it commits itself too
                            exclusively to one side, Guinea will be unable to maintain its position
                            of true neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> pointed out that he and
                            other Guinean ambassadors now have the equivalent of cabinet rank and
                            have full power to enter into negotiations. “I come here with the best
                            will to succeed in these negotiations but will remain here only so long
                            as I feel there is some chance of success. The moment I am convinced
                            that there is no hope for these negotiations, I shall leave”.</p>
                        <p>Above all Guinea needs trained personnel, the Ambassador stated. Although
                            he had met dozens of students from English-speaking Africa here, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> expressed regret that
                            there were only two Guineans in the U.S. and he had not met any students
                            from Senegal, the Ivory Cost or other French-speaking areas. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> referred to the
                            language barrier and stated that after these areas become independent
                            there would undoubtedly be a greater exchange of students.</p>
                        <p>High on the list of Guinean needs were agricultural products (both loans
                            and purchase) and loans for development, according to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName>. Guinea is quite satisfied with
                            the functioning of Fria and remembers that this enterprise showed
                            confidence in the new government just after independence when others did
                            not. To attract further U.S. investments Guinea had passed an investment
                            guarantee law five days before. The country also needs payment
                            facilities to obtain dollars; Guinea wanted American products (and had
                            bought automobiles, <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0740"/>motor
                            cycles, etc., last year) but had been prevented from making further
                            purchases because of the lack of dollars. Above all, Guinea needs the
                            Konkoure Dam and hopes the U.S. can be persuaded to help build it. This
                            project is so essential, the Ambassador maintained, that we cannot wait
                            for any one country but will appeal to everyone to help us with this
                            dam. We are prepared to do everything to cooperate with the U.S. and
                            realize this project must be considered in conjunction with similar
                            projects in Ghana and the Belgian Congo. Guinea believes the Konkoure
                            project is by far the most feasible economically because of the
                            proximity of the bauxite deposits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> asked whether Guinea
                            had considered joining the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
                            The Ambassador reported that Guinea had welcomed an official of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> who had made suggestions, but
                            with the advent of the new currency reforms the situation had changed.
                            Now his Government wanted to consolidate the new currency before
                            considering whether it would join the Bank or the Fund; possibly in a
                            year it would be in a position to join.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Ambassador continued, Guinea would like U.S. banks to
                            establish themselves in the country. Also it hoped that the Pan American
                            Airways would agree to stop over in Conakry on their Dakar-Roberts Field
                            flights.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> for this exposition. As a result of Sekou Toure’s
                            letter to the President,<note n="1" xml:id="d326fn1">The letter, dated
                                April 20, was delivered to the Department by Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> on April 29. It enclosed
                                descriptions of Guinea’s recently-adopted currency reform and
                                Three-Year Plan, and stated that <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                    >Touré</persName> would welcome “all suggestions and proposals
                                you deem appropriate to give us on this matter.” (<hi rend="italic"

                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s reply, dated
                                May 14 and transmitted in telegram 565 to Conakry of that date,
                                stated that U.S. experts would be discussing the points raised in
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Touré</persName>’s letter with
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> and assured
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Touré</persName> of “the great
                                sympathy with which we regard your efforts to improve conditions in
                                Guinea.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files,
                                870B.13/5-1460)</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> has been asked by the President to discuss mutual
                            problems with the Guinean Ambassador. The U.S. Government was studying
                            the possibility of modifying the usual procedures so that it would
                            conform with the special situation in Africa.</p>
                        <p>We have confidence in the U.S., the Ambassador affirmed, but something
                            must be done soon to justify such confidence. Since he planned to attend
                            the Conference of Independent African States in Addis Ababa on June 15,
                            he expected to discuss the entire question of U.S. aid with President
                            Toure who will also be in Ethiopia. By that time he hoped he would have
                            some definite information to give his President.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> that we would do our best to find a satisfactory
                            solution.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador began by announcing he did not intend to go to Addis Ababa
                            on June 15, as previously planned, and would return to Conakry only if
                            his negotiations with U.S. officials seem to warrant his personal
                            consultations with President Toure.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary outlined the contents of an Aide-Mémoire proposing
                            U.S. assistance (attached).<note n="1" xml:id="d327fn1">Not printed. It
                                stated that the U.S. Government was prepared to offer Guinea
                                approximately 7,000 tons of rice, valued at $1 million, under
                                Section 402 of the Mutual Security Act and a local currency sales
                                program valued at $7.5 million for a 3-year period beginning July 1
                                under Public Law 480, and that it had under study the question of
                                the Konkoure Dam survey. It further stated that the United States
                                was prepared to discuss making available commodities such as jeeps,
                                tractors, cement, and peanut oil, subject to funds being made
                                available by Congress, that it was prepared to offer technical
                                assistance, subject to the conclusion of an agreement, and that
                                Guinea was eligible for aid projects in the fields of education and
                                training under the Special Program for Tropical Africa and was
                                eligible to apply to the Development Loan Fund and the Export-Import
                                Bank for capital funds on a loan basis. It expressed the hope that
                                Guinea would consider joining the International Bank for
                                Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary
                                Fund.</note> He said he realized the importance the Guineans
                            attached to the Konkoure Dam and observed that the most significant
                            first step would be to up-date the present plans for this project. The
                            question of the survey was under study at this time and we hoped in two
                            or three weeks to give the Ambassador more definite news on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stressed the importance
                            of prompt Guinean action on the offer of 7,000 tons of rice under
                            Section 402 of the Mutual Security Act. Perhaps the Guinean Government
                            did not fully appreciate the urgency of meeting the June 30, 1960
                            deadline for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960, but the U.S.
                            Government would have to act soon so that the 7,000 tons of rice and one
                            million dollars could be set aside for this purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0742"/>
                        <p>The Guinean Ambassador expressed the profound gratitude of his Government
                            for this generous offer. He assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> that Guinea appreciated the Section 402 offer and
                            he would telegraph Conakry that night concerning the need for prompt
                            action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> expressed the
                            hope that, given the lack of organization in the Guinean Foreign
                            Ministry, the Department would explain to him (at the same time
                            Ambassador Morrow was approaching officials in Conakry) the significance
                            of major U.S. démarches in Guinea. He could then support Mr. Morrow’s
                            efforts in Conakry by telegram from Washington and perhaps help his
                            Government understand some of the aspects of diplomacy that might be
                            taken for granted in more experienced countries.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Konkoure Dam was concerned, the Ambassador declared that
                            Guinea placed primary importance on this project and he looked forward
                            to discussing the dam again with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> in two or three weeks.</p>
                        <p>Also, the Ambassador reported that he had been engaged in continuous
                            discussions with <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> in a very friendly
                            atmosphere concerning a possible bilateral agreement. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> said he believed he understood
                            now the reasons why <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> was insisting on
                            certain points and he hoped the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            representatives understood why the Guinean Government had raised the
                            objections it had. After Guinea’s independence, there had been a sudden
                            vacuum when French technicians were withdrawn. Since then, many of these
                            positions have been filled by foreigners who have not been accorded any
                            special privileges. If the Guinean Government should now make an
                            exception for American technicians, it would be difficult to explain
                            this to the other foreigners who have been there all along.</p>
                        <p>The important point, however, is that we are convinced of U.S. good will,
                            and are anxious to cooperate with the United States, the Ambassador
                            declared. We want to thank you not only for this present aid offer, but
                            also for previous assistance from the U.S. and the invitation to
                            President Toure.</p>
                        <p>(In leaving, the Guinean Desk Officer informed the Ambassador that, since
                            negotiations were still under way, he hoped the Guinean Government would
                            make no announcement now of this aid offer. The Ambassador agreed to
                            this request.)</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary replied US realizes West African development is
                            interrelated and that Konkoure project cannot be examined in vacuum.
                            Volta, Kouilou, Konkoure and possibly Inga<note n="4" xml:id="d328fn4"

                            want, however, have announcement made well in advance of <persName

                            tantamount to commitment construct project. Study additionally gives us
                            period of time to think subject through more thoroughly. Also useful

                            that we not sure what influence we would have on this subject but would
                            talk to companies about French position and needs. Noted that, given
                            size of reserves at Boke, consortium might be looking for

                        <p>“During the conversations between the Ambassador of Guinea and Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, on June 10,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> expressed the
                            interest of the Guinean Government in obtaining assistance for the
                            construction of the Konkoure Dam (Souapiti). At that time, the United
                            States informed the Guinean Government that the question of the Konkoure
                            Dam survey was under study and that the United States hoped to be in a
                            position to discuss the matter soon.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government is now pleased to inform the Government of
                            Guinea that the United States Government would be prepared to undertake,
                            at its own expense, a study of the Konkoure <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715"
                                facs="0745"/>hydroelectric project, taking into account all
                            information previously prepared and available with respect to the
                            project. If the Government of Guinea so desires, the United States would
                            be prepared to proceed expeditiously with the arrangements for
                            completing an up-to-date study of the Konkoure Dam project.</p>
                        <p>Following this study, the United States Government will consider how it
                            might assist financially, in addition to financial participation of
                            other appropriate private and public sources, in the construction of
                            this project, if the project is found to be economically and financially
                            feasible and private financing for related aluminum smelter facilities
                            is assured.</p>
                        <p>It is observed that the proposed Konkoure Dam and related aluminum
                            operations in the Republic of Guinea form one of a number of
                            power-aluminum complexes, such as the Volta, Kouilou and Inga projects,
                            which are at some stage of consideration in several states of Africa by
                            various governments, enterprises or international institutions. Aiso,
                            the sale of Guinean bauxite or alumina may yield additional export
                            earnings to Guinea by providing other aluminum-power complexes in Africa
                            a useful source of supply. Pertinent aspects of these matters may
                            warrant study at an appropriate time in relation to progress regarding
                            the Konkoure Dam.</p>
                        <p>As the Government of Guinea is aware, the International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development has had wide experience in hydroelectric
                            field and recourse to the Bank at the earliest feasible time could be
                            very useful in the construction of this project.”</p>
                        <p>Assuming Guineans approve our offer, Dept intends make press release.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> has recommended
                            simultaneous release in both capitals, probably next week. Embassy
                            should provide <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> advance copy our

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> observed that we
                            had made an offer on the Konkoure Dam which, in conjunction with the
                            offer of the private aluminum producers, constituted a serious proposal
                            to aid Guinea. We were waiting for a reply to our offer of July 19 to
                            resurvey the dam; as the President was aware, this was the same
                            procedure we had followed in the case of the Volta River Dam in Ghana.
                            There the new study had resulted in lowering the estimated cost of the
                            dam by a very large margin.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Toure reaffirmed that the Konkoure Dam was the cornerstone of
                            Guinea’s development plans. What he reproached the US for, in a friendly
                            manner, was that although there was no country in a better position to
                            aid Africa (the US had no colonies there and was the most advanced
                            nation in the world), the US apparently had little understanding of the
                            needs of Africa or the desperate urgency of those needs. For example,
                            when the announcement was made last year that 150 scholarships would be
                            offered Guinea, every one expected these students would leave at once.
                            If the US could have sent five students the same week of the
                            announcement, the effect would have been extraordinary. Now, however, a
                            year has passed, and frankly, much of the effectiveness of this offer
                            has been lost.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, Guinea sent an urgent circular appeal to the US, <gloss

                            had been satisfactory in principle but Toure said he had been definitely
                            disappointed by the qualifying remarks. It was apparent that the US did
                            not understand the great importance which Guinea places on its
                            Three-Year Plan.</p>
                        <p>The National Economic Convention scheduled for the middle of October has
                            been postponed until the end of the month or the beginning of November.
                            At that time all the replies to the circular appeal will be submitted
                            for general discussion and after each offer has been considered, the

                        <p>According to the President, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            offered Guinea a long-term loan to finance the entire construction of
                            the Konkoure Dam and is prepared to send all the technicians and
                            equipment necessary to begin work on January 1, 1961. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, which is not acquainted with this
                            project, had replied that it would have to undertake a new survey,<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d330fn5">A handwritten note in the margin next to this
                                sentence reads: “They did so reply.”</note> the Guineans would have
                            some understanding of the necessity for such a delay; they find it more
                            difficult to understand why the US, which already has the French plans
                            for this dam, should propose another survey. If the US should make an
                            offer now equivalent to that of the Soviets’, however, there would be no
                            question that Guinea would accept the US offer instead. When Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> indicated that
                            the Guineans might find they had committed themselves too heavily to the
                            Soviets and were no longer in a position to choose who would or would
                            not participate in projects in Guinea, Mr. Toure replied that he would
                            prefer to have the US build the dam but was obliged to begin work as
                            soon as possible on the basis of the best possible offer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> emphasized that
                            we wanted to help Guinea on this project and had had a great deal of
                            experience in building dams. The President replied that the Soviets were
                            prepared to supply everything that was needed. He had asked Fria and
                            Olin Mathieson repeatedly to construct the dam but they had never agreed
                            to do so. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName>
                            interjected that the US offer was tied in with the projected aluminum
                            smelter to be built by a consortium of Western producers <pb n="718"
                                xml:id="pg_718" facs="0748"/>including Olin Mathieson.) When Toure
                            complained that the International Bank also had not helped, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> pointed out
                            that Guinea was not a member of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>As far as the $35 million Soviet line of credit was concerned, the
                            President declared that Guinea had utilized none of it so far. Mr.
                            Ismael Toure corrected him to say that Guinea had in fact bought some
                            Soviet jeeps. The President agreed and pointed out that he would have
                            preferred American jeeps but he had received no satisfaction on his
                            repeated requests for them. The Soviet line of credit was to be used
                            principally to modernize Guinea’s agriculture but, if necessary, it
                            could all be devoted to construction of the dam.</p>
                        <p>When the Assistant Secretary indicated that it was sometimes difficult
                            for democracies to operate as fast as authoritarian governments, Toure
                            commented that he, nevertheless, “knew” that $13 million had been
                            allotted for US aid to Guinea (which he noted with satisfaction was one
                            of the highest amounts allotted any African country) but that “not one
                            dollar” had yet arrived in Guinea. The Assistant Secretary said he would
                            discuss this matter further with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> in Washington in order to make sure our figures
                            agreed with those of the President.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> observed
                            that the Soviets were not disinterested in their aid offers, the
                            President replied that he was convinced the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> was not doing this for selfish interests but genuinely
                            to help Guinea.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that he had hoped to have a chance to speak with
                            President Toure the day before but that it would have been impossible
                            for him to go all the way out to Riverdale in the late afternoon traffic
                            and keep all the other appointments which he had made that day. He said
                            he had a number of things to take up and thought that the best way to
                            present them was in the form of aides-mémoire.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he was very pleased to have this opportunity
                            to see the Secretary since he had made many requests in the past and had
                            been unable to arrange an appointment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> expressed great disappointment that the Secretary
                            was not able to discuss the grave problems raised in the aides-mémoire
                            directly with President Toure. He reiterated his previous requests to
                            arrange an appointment between the President and Sekou Toure and was
                            sorry this could not have been arranged. President Toure had not been
                            able to receive the Secretary at the United Nations because he had
                            considered that there were important matters between the two countries
                            which should be discussed calmly, outside the atmosphere of the United
                            Nations. He regretted that as Guinean Ambassador he had apparently so
                            little credit with the U.S. Government that he was unable to arrange a
                            meeting between his president and the U.S. Chief of State, let alone the
                            American Secretary of State. The U.S. attitude appeared to raise the
                            serious question whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> should continue to remain in the U.S. or should
                            ask to be relieved.</p>

                        <p>After discussing the memorandum on the Congo (separate memorandum of
                            conversation) the Ambassador raised the problems on the aide-mémoire
                            concerning technical assistance. Generally he agreed with everything in
                            the memorandum except for one point which was totally inexact: namely
                            that concerning the million dollars for agricultural products. (The
                            aide-mémoire had said “This credit was opened in June 1960, but it was
                            not until October 11, 1960, during the current visit of President Toure
                            that information was received that Guinea would be prepared to make
                            purchases against it.” This was later changed to “This credit was opened
                            in June 1960 but no orders have been placed so far.” before the
                            aide-mémoire was handed to the Ambassador.)</p>
                        <p>Concerning the aide-mémoire on the Konkoure Dam the Ambassador agreed in
                            principle to the points raised but noted that they would be subject to
                            further discussion. One point he did want to emphasize, however, was the
                            urgency with which Guinea regarded this very vital project. As President
                            Toure had pointed out to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName>, the U.S. did not appear to appreciate the
                            vital need to proceed with development in his country.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that there appeared to be something of a
                            contradiction in what the Ambassador had just said. We had offered on
                            July 19 to undertake a new survey of the Dam and no reply had yet been
                            received. This had nothing to do with the “slowness” of our
                            parliamentary procedures to which the Ambassador had referred. Certainly
                            we would have had the survey well under way now if Guinea had accepted
                            our offer in July. Moreover, the U.S. would not have made this offer
                            unless it seriously considered helping the development program in
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that, since the U.S. already has the previous
                            studies made on this project, Guinea expects something more than just
                            another survey. Moreover, there were so many conditions in the U.S offer
                            that Guinea was unable to conclude whether the U.S. was genuinely
                            prepared to go ahead with this project or not. For this reason the
                            American offer was considered as possibly constituting a delaying
                            action.</p>
                        <p>As far as the aide-mémoire on foreign policy was concerned, this raised
                            very serious problems to which President Toure himself would reply. The
                            Ambassador very strongly urged the Secretary to arrange a meeting with
                            Sekou Toure before the President left New York on October 18. The
                            Ambassador said he was not in possession of all the declarations made
                            during his President’s trip to the Far East, but he wished to confirm
                            categorically that there was no basis to the assertion that Guinea had
                            left the path of neutrality.</p>
                        <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0751"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> returned to his
                            own “problem of conscience” in the development of U.S.-Guinean
                            relations. He had himself insisted on separating Guinean representation
                            to both the U.N. and the U.S. so that he could devote his full time to
                            dealing with the U.S. In Guinea he is known as “the man of Americans”.
                            This may not be completely so, since he is above all loyal to Guinea,
                            but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> emphasized
                            that he was indeed a true friend of the U.S. If he could not be more
                            useful in furthering good relations between the two countries than he
                            appeared to be able to do now, it would be doing everyone a disservice
                            if he remained at his post. If under the present circumstances, Sekou
                            Toure should leave without meeting a high member of the U.S. Government,
                            the situation would be very unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would assure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DTB1"
                                >Diallo</persName> that someone from the U.S. Government would
                            discuss these problems with President Toure before his departure.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DTB1">Diallo</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for these encouraging words and urged again that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> receive his own
                            President. He pointed out that Guinea had bought a new chancery and
                            residence in Washington which the President had hoped to dedicate.
                            Moreover, the other heads of state and important visitors had been
                            received by the President and even the heads of delegations of all the
                            newly-admitted nations in the U.N. Unfortunately Guinea was unable to
                            arrange an appointment even with the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that he had done his best the day before and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> pointed out
                            that other chiefs of state had been quite willing to receive the
                            Secretary at the U.N.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed in parting that the Ambassador would be informed before the
                            end of the day which American official would call on Sekou Toure.<note

                        <p>1. Church asked about arms shipments from <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> which he said had been mentioned to him by other

                            but admitted there large stock small arms in Guinea as well as some
                            anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Said small arms would be stock of all
                            villages in order arm whole population if need arose for national
                            defense. Said he would make public announcement this effect shortly.</p>
                        <p>2. Toure repeated old complaint US ignored his requests for arms and
                            economic and technical aid. “If I listen to advice from one side, it
                            only because nothing coming from other side.”</p>

                            to investigate practicability of partition; (B) if investigation shows

                            investigation. Although Union in its independent paragraph anticipates
                            some details of partition. Possible trusteeship agreement, the committee
                            expressly refrains from “any pronouncement on the merits and demerits”

                            discussions, is endeavoring to create impression that meeting resulted
                            in “progress” and endeavored to say so in agreed press release. I
                            insisted successfully on present language i.e., “the parties feel that
                            the discussions have attained a stage where the committee is able to
                            report, et cetera”. Such progress as may have been made require calipers
                            to measure; but at the same time I agreed that there is nothing we can
                            do in face of adamant attitude of Union than to report to <gloss

                            partition discussed, and considering the statement and press release
                            that “certain aspects will require further study” I feel that my visit
                            to the territory on a guided tour will be readily interpreted as a
                            commitment in favor of partition. Wieschoff (Secretariat) fully agrees
                            and is himself not going. I should go he would also, in order to make it
                            an obvious <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> visit; but he believes that
                            this would kill any remote chances there may be that the fourth

                            agreed with Union representatives that submission of draft to Union is
                            only to permit it to comment on portion intended to reflect South

                        <p>At today’s staff meeting you asked whether I thought it was just a matter
                            of time when violence might start in the Union of South Africa against
                            Europeans. Your question suggested also that you would be interested to
                            know the extent of Communist penetration in the African populations in
                            the Union.</p>
                        <p>During the 12 days I was in the Transvaal (of which 10 days in Pretoria
                            with a brief visit to Johannesburg, and two days in Kruger Park) I was
                            pretty well circumscribed in my contacts which consisted almost entirely
                            of Union officials and diplomats. I am hardly qualified to write even
                            “Inside the Union of South Africa”. I was, however, <pb n="727"
                                xml:id="pg_727" facs="0757"/>taken by officials to visit some slum
                            clearance and resettlement projects for Africans and colored in and
                            around Johannesburg, including the notorious Sofiatown. Curiously, while
                            Foreign Office officials attacked foreign (especially <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) intrusion in the Union’s domestic
                            affairs, they and other officials at the same time took the initiative
                            to help me “understand” the Union’s internal problems and policies
                            better. Thus I was exposed to many long speeches by Union officials on
                            apartheid. My sources are listed on the last page.<note n="1"

                        <p>The policies of the Strijdom Government are not only those of eventual
                            total segregation of non-European peoples within the Union, economic,
                            political, cultural and social, but also of total domination of the
                            society of the Union by the Afrikaner element. The English-speaking
                            element has pretty much lost out politically; culturally and
                            linguistically it is in a steep decline; and economically it faces a
                            rough struggle for survival. Members of the Embassy said that quite a
                            few of their English-speaking friends had decided after the latest
                            elections to move to other parts of the Commonwealth; others are
                            thinking of doing so.</p>
                        <p>The Government applies its immigration laws selectively and restrictively
                            against the English and Europeans who are not Germanic and Calvinist.
                            This is probably unnecessary since the Union’s domestic policies do not
                            attract many settlers. Catholics in one way or another seem to be
                            excluded; and no Catholic priest enters to minister or to engage in
                            educational or social work. The foreign traveler on arriving in the
                            Union is confronted by a form headed in red uppercase letters: WARNING
                            TO ALIENS!</p>
                        <p>The curfew, which I believe varies somewhat from place to place, against
                            non-Europeans is vigorously enforced. The African may not leave his
                            “location” roughly between the hours of 9 PM and 6 AM. This provides for
                            a European monopoly even of hooliganism, which, for example, is admitted
                            in Johannesburg to be beyond the ability of the police effectively to
                            cope with. The security forces seem to be even less interested in what
                            goes on among Africans within their locations. The authorities couldn’t
                            care less how many fewer Africans there might be the next morning. In
                            Johannesburg visiting women are warned at their hotel not to be on the
                            street unaccompanied after 6 PM; and men are reportedly normally armed
                            when not at home after dark.</p>
                        <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0758"/>
                        <p>Europeans who have non-European servants living out have to provide
                            “passes” for their servants or themselves drive them home after dark.
                            The pass is by no means a guarantee of safety. Native servants may live
                            in at Pretoria, provided their masters house them outside their own
                            dwelling house, e.g. the garage. There was much talk in Pretoria still
                            about the former private secretary to Strijdom who during the election
                            campaign was brought into court for having an affair with a native girl.
                            He was fined £25; she was given six months of hard labor. While he lost
                            his job as Secretary, I understand he was elected on the Nationalist
                            ticket over his United party opponent to the House.</p>
                        <p>In view of the official attitudes toward what goes on within the
                            locations it is logical to conclude that the South African security
                            authorities do not get very reliable intelligence with respect to
                            African attitudes and the activities, if any, of subversive agents.</p>
                        <p>The official attitude toward the United States being rather cool,
                            although correct, the relations between our own intelligence people and
                            those of the Union have gone downhill from the time that Mr. Wailes<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">Edward T. Wailes, Ambassador to South Africa,
                                1954–1956.</note> was Ambassador (he has just told me that in his
                            time the relations were reasonably satisfactory). It seems to me
                            unlikely, therefore, that we can get much reliable intelligence through
                            the South Africans.</p>
                        <p>There are, moreover, great difficulties in the way of direct contacts
                            with non-Europeans. The Union Ministry of External Affairs, for example,
                            has even complained to the Embassy when members of the Staff have had
                            American negroes in their homes. There is great vigilance exercised by
                            the authorities over the movements and conduct of our own officials. I
                            was, myself, quite conscious of this with respect to the Members of the
                            Good Offices Committee, who incidentally were “warned” by the Union High
                            Commissioner in London when we met there that our contacts should be
                            solely with officials of the Government. I do not think you want me to
                            go into the details of the application of apartheid and of the
                            Government’s cultural and linguistic policies but I cannot refrain from
                            mentioning some of the extremes, and some estimate of the eventual
                            results. For example, in Prestoria they do not have Jim Crow buses; they
                            have two bus systems. In most office buildings, there is one elevator
                            reserved for non-Europeans. The school system restricts the choice of
                            schools linguistically so that an Afrikaans-speaking student can only go
                            to an Afrikaans school, taking English as a subject only. The
                            English-speaking officers in the Army and Air Force have now practically
                            all been retired. Any paper going to the Ministerial level must be in
                            Afrikaans. The Cabinet conducts its business in Afrikaans. The menials
                            in government offices are now <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0759"
                            />almost entirely Afrikaners. (Generally, at this point retired railway
                            employees do the custodial services.) The Foreign Office communicates
                            with its missions alternately month by month in English and Afrikaans.
                            Promotion in the Foreign Service is dependent upon a periodic successful
                            examination in Afrikaans.</p>
                        <p>The estimate of the Embassy and of a couple of the English-speaking
                            Foreign Office officials who had occasion to talk with me privately is
                            that in a few years the Union will be monolingual in Afrikaans. These
                            (but not the Afrikaners) look forward “in a few years” to, at a minimum,
                            a Mau Mau situation. The Afrikaners on the other hand insist that any
                            “mixture” of races or cultures spells the end of “European” culture on
                            the continent; and that their policies are the logical and best ones to
                            preserve the continent (and the world) from barbarism and communism.</p>
                        <p>Although I can hardly ask you to read them, I shall be glad to forward to
                            you in a couple of days a copy of a more detailed memorandum I am

                        <p>I reminded <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> that the
                            resolution obtained, in large part at least by our efforts, contained
                            little more than what we had in past years seen fit to vote for in
                            piecemeal fashion. I thought U. S. press treatment as he had read it to
                            me made too much of point of connection our own domestic problems with
                            our vote in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Nevertheless I
                            supposed in fact there might be some connection. For one thing it could
                            hardly be denied that our problems at home had made more people aware of
                            and think about racial problems than in years of the recent past. Also
                            if we felt compelled to uphold a vital principle considered West in
                            East-West struggle for men’s minds in our own country to extent of much
                            regretted necessity use troops to enforce courts’ decision and
                            integration, we would perhaps be less likely avoid taking a position
                            against segregation and discrimination abroad. However I thought Union
                            should appreciate our desire avoid singling out Union for condemnation
                            and general tone of Harrison’s remarks which showed considerable
                            sympathy and understanding of magnitude of local problem here. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> said he would try in the next
                            Parliamentary debate to put the brighter side (milder resolution, etc. )
                            forward, but that I should know there was considerable feeling in Union
                            about U. S. position. He said as far as he was concerned he would have
                            preferred <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0762"/>the original Indian
                            resolution with our abstention rather than the modified resolution with
                            our support. When I expressed surprise at this statement he said he
                            wished be very frank. A specific and strong resolution against South
                            Africa voted for by a majority of nations in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> did not matter so much as this was to be expected. What
                            mattered perhaps more than all other votes put together was that of U.

                            Accra treated as White man, leaders of local Bantu would want similar
                            treatment. He was referring to time when separate Bantu states will have
                            been created and presumably be run by Bantu authorities.</p>

                            has sense of humor but I do not think it would extend to racial
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Despite above his manner was extremely friendly. I received impression he
                            really does not understand why world does not see his point on race
                            relations within Union. He spoke of Black man in kindly and clearly
                            sincere terms. He honestly believes his policies are best for all
                            concerned. At this point he asked me his first question, “Why do you
                            think we are so misunderstood?” For half hour I attempted explain in
                            moderate language objection of most Americans to his policies. He
                            listened carefully and thanked me profusely. Believe I have established
                            working relationship that might some day pay moderate dividends.</p>

                        <p>14. Ex-Chief Albert Luthuli, President of African National Congress, told
                            me that present government of union is worst he has ever had to deal
                            with and that unless there is some softening in its attitude toward
                            country’s 9 million non-whites he does not see how trouble can be
                            avoided. He added that he himself is against violence but that <pb

                            Communist infiltration he said he knew there was some Red influence in
                                <gloss target="#t_ANC1">ANC</gloss> but that is not important.</p>
                        <p>I talked with Luthuli at town of Stanger, in area to which he has been
                                exiled,<note n="1" xml:id="d338fn1">The South African Government

                            so that I had about fifteen minutes alone with ex-Chief.</p>
                        <p>Luthuli said his exile is mild. He is allowed to see friends, write
                            letters, and even write for publication but he cannot address a meeting
                            of more than three persons. He said he is lucky that he has not been
                            sent to infamous prison camp in Kalahari Desert. He spoke highly of
                            United States and he said he hopes his daughter can be educated
                            there.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> planned to put on record
                            the objections of his Government to their discussion under Articles 55
                            and 56 in view of the overriding application of Article 2 paragraph 7
                            concerning domestic jurisdiction. He expressed his disappointment that
                            the U.S. had supported so-called “moderate” resolutions on these items
                            last year,<note n="3" xml:id="d340fn3">See <ref target="#d336fn1"

                                by the General Assembly on December 10, 1958, appealed to South
                                Africa to enter into negotiations with India and Pakistan on the
                                question of the treatment of people of Indian origin in South
                                Africa; for text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy:

                            this point. He felt that Krishna Menon had led other delegations “down
                            the garden path” in his formulation of the resolutions which—whatever
                            their wording—still had sting in them of intervening in South African
                            domestic affairs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> planned to devote his
                            entire speech in the general debate to Africa with a view to developing
                            the attitude of his government in respect to this continent. He felt
                            that independence was coming too rapidly in parts of Africa, where the
                            masses were still primitive, and that the Union’s policy of developing
                            self-government for its Africans in due course should be explained. He
                            emphasized the fact that unlike other European territories in Africa,
                            the white population in the Union was permanent. His own roots went back
                            250 to 300 years, and neither the Europeans of Dutch or British ancestry
                            had any <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0767"/>real affinity with any
                            other country. He thought, moreover, that full equity for the natives in
                            the Union would not only swamp the Europeans but it would be bad for the
                            West as a whole to have the southern tip of Africa under a native
                            proletariat control. He referred to the fact that the African National
                            Congress, although not banned in his country, was under communist
                            domination. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> described as
                            “unbelievable” the press distortions in the U.S., U.K., and especially
                            Sweden concerning the true conditions in the Union of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>With respect to South West Africa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2"
                                >Louw</persName> reaffirmed his Government’s position that the
                            League “died without leaving a testament” and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> therefore had no authority with respect
                            to this territory. Noting that he probably was the only head of
                            delegation who had served in both the League of Nations and the United
                            Nations, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> said that the
                            treatment of this problem by the League was entirely different from that
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, especially with respect to the
                            hearing of oral evidence. He then went on to complain of the assistance
                            of the United States Consul General in Salisbury in giving Mr.
                                Beukas,<note n="4" xml:id="d340fn4">Hans J. Beukas, a South West

                                declared the withdrawal of his passport to be contrary to the

                            a visa and travel documentation for the purpose of giving oral testimony
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Beukas had been condemned by
                            his father and the elders of his tribe for undertaking this trip. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> said that a visa
                            presupposed a passport and he repeated his complaint about giving Beukas
                            a visa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that under the U.S. agreement with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the Department had no alternative but to
                            issue a visa to anyone who had obtained an invitation from the <gloss

                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He could understand how various
                            governments might not always be pleased with this procedure. If there
                            was any remedy, however, it was to persuade the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> to be more discriminating in its invitations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> concluded the above

                        <p>153. I had long cordial talk with Prime Minister today in which he
                            covered his government’s native policy and his thinking in regard to
                            Southwest Africa and British protectorates. Among previously unclarified
                            points that he raised in hour-long discussion was financial help to
                            native areas. He told me that press reports to the contrary his
                            government is prepared to spend many million pounds to make “Bantustans”
                            economically viable. He added that the half million pounds so far
                            appropriated is only a token.</p>
                        <p>After sketching history of the Union’s relations with Southwest Africa he
                            said that it is his government’s policy to cooperate with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that he had instructed his UN
                            representatives to make it clear that the Union is quite willing to
                            enter into complete review of entire question. He said that adverse
                            resolution by Afro-Asian nations however might make such gesture
                            difficult for him in view of anti-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            feeling in the country at large.</p>
                        <p>Questioned on British protectorates, Prime Minister, without actually
                            saying so, gave me definite impression that he is contemplating some
                            sort of economic sanctions if British continue to go ahead with plans
                            toward making these enclaves self-supporting. He pointed out heatedly
                            that the protectorates should belong to the Union and that if they were
                            added to his country problem of land for new native states would be
                            largely solved as one half of total area of such an enlarged Union could
                            then be in native hands.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister has a great deal of confidence in his powers as a
                            persuader and said rather wistfully that he wished it were possible for
                            him to go to America and explain his government’s policies. I did not
                            urge him to embark on such a crusade but said I would report him
                            faithfully during my forthcoming visits to Washington.</p>

                            to achieve the purposes of the resolution. It was adopted by a vote of

                                with respect to legal action was made clear by its support of

                        <p>On March 21, at least 68 people were killed and more than 220 were
                            injured in Sharpeville, South Africa, when police fired on demonstrators
                            who were participating in country-wide protests against the South
                            African pass laws. At the Department of State press briefing on March
                            22, in response to a query from a news correspondent, Director of the
                            Office of News Lincoln White read the following statement:</p>
                        <p>“ The United States deplores violence in all its forms and hopes that the
                            African people of South Africa will be able to obtain redress for
                            legitimate grievances by peaceful means. While the United States, as a
                            matter of practice, does not ordinarily comment on the internal affairs
                            of governments with which it enjoys normal relations, it cannot help but
                            regret the tragic loss of life resulting from the measures taken against
                            the demonstrators in South Africa.”</p>
                        <p>Telegram 49 to Capetown, March 22, informed the Embassy that the
                            statement had been prepared in view of the prominent press attention to
                            the incident and the impossibility of avoiding press questioning. It
                            stated that White had refused to interpret the statement and declined to
                            comment on further questions. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> raised this

                            at a meeting at 8:45 a.m. on March 24. The relevant portion of a

                                Goodpaster</persName>, reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The President said he had seen in the newspapers a statement from the
                            State Department deploring actions in South Africa, and asked about
                            this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he had not
                            heard about this until after the statement had been made to the press.
                            He is furious about it, <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0772"
                            />regarding it as a breach of courtesy between nations. It occurred
                            through internal failure within the State Department whereby a bureau
                            chief proposed a statement and the press office released it without
                            checking at the top policy level, and without investigating the facts of
                            the matter. The President said the fat is in the fire. All he could see
                            to do would be to call in the South African Ambassador and tell him
                            that, although we are much distressed by events in South Africa, we do
                            not regard it as our business to make public statements about this, and
                            officially regret having done so. This action should be kept secret. In
                            further discussion, the President agreed that this action might be taken
                            through our Ambassador in South Africa if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> wishes. The President said
                            that, if it were his decision, he would find another post for the bureau
                            chief involved.” (Eisenhower Library, Staff Secretary Records)</p>

                        <p>“The appearance in the press Wednesday morning of the Department’s rather
                            strong statement deploring the police violence in South Africa took me
                            by surprise. On inquiring, I have learned that Messrs. <persName

                        <p>“The issuance of a statement of this nature outspokenly critical of a
                            Government with which we maintain friendly relations, and on a subject
                            which not only has world-wide interest, but also involves domestic
                            political factors—is, it seems to me, a decision to be taken only at the
                            highest level in the Department of State.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>(A) I do not believe our relations with the Union are likely to be
                            permanently damaged, but there is no disguising fact government will
                            certainly be extremely cool for long time to come. Our action at this
                            time is bitterly resented by government and by great mass of Afrikaner
                            people, who feel we have sold out Whites in order to curry favor with
                            Blacks.</p>

                            intransigence and rising native resistance result in ever more frequent

                            spreading that US now supports their course. Rising tension and
                            disturbances have prevented our seeing any natives last few days but
                            above impression confirmed by White sources. Conservative opposition

                        <p>In my opinion police had no choice under circumstances, but South African
                            riot control tactics not similar to ours. US police might have

                        <p>I am concerned over trend of events here. Government plan to ban African
                            National Congress and Pan-Africanists, thus driving them underground,
                            continuing demonstrations by natives seeking turn in passes and be
                            arrested, day of mourning on 28 March, all make for a very tense
                            atmosphere to which I believe our statement [on?] this contributed.</p>
                        <p>In the future I would appreciate being consulted before such statements

                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated that because of its urgency he would like
                            first to raise the South African problem. The President agreed and the
                            Prime Minister said that he was very worried about the forthcoming
                            discussions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                            meeting, called on the initiative of the Afro-Asian bloc in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He indicated that he understood that the
                            United States as a matter of fixed policy always supported inscription.
                            The Prime Minister’s problem was essentially whether the British should
                            oppose inscription. They had in fact done so in the past. If they do not
                            oppose, they risk losing the Union of South Africa. On the other hand,
                            if they do oppose, they risk losing the emergent African states over
                            which they hope to have a strong influence. It was all well enough to
                            contemplate the satisfaction of the fine statements which would be made
                            and the vote which would be obtained, but this had to be balanced
                            against the British hope for a more liberal evolution inside the Union
                            of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his sympathy with the Prime Minister’s dilemma,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> added that our
                            Embassy in Pretoria had reported that there was some question as to
                            whether the Union of South Africa might not in fact leave the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if the subject were taken up.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister resumed, saying that if the British let the meeting go
                            ahead, then maybe with US help an innocuous resolution could be
                            obtained. Fortunately Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> is in the chair this month. He therefore hoped
                            that it would be possible for the British to propose that they be
                            allowed to protest the procedure orally and then <pb n="746"
                                xml:id="pg_746" facs="0776"/>have the chairman’s acquiescence in not
                            pushing this protest to a vote. Then, in the Security Council, we could
                            go ahead to work for a moderate resolution.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would agree with such a procedure. He had
                            strong feelings that one could not sit in judgment on a difficult social
                            and political problem six thousand miles away. He had to say that our
                            own problem was in his mind in this connection, and that he had some
                            sympathy even with his friends in Atlanta on some of their difficulties.
                            He suggested that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution could
                            perhaps just express regret about the disturbances in South Africa and
                            hope that measures would be taken to prevent their recurrence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the
                            Department had been trying to work towards such an end with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName> of Tunisia. However, it
                            seemed certain that the language which emerged from the Afro-Asian
                            group, even under the relatively moderate influence of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SM8">Slim</persName>, would be too tough and
                            would attempt to condemn the South African Government’s policy.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated that the United States would go as far as possible
                            along the lines indicated consistent with our past record on
                            inscription.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister commented that if the resolution were too violent,
                            perhaps we could muster the necessary 7 votes to beat it, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that this would
                            be desirable. The Prime Minister then went on to say that he would send
                            a message saying that this line should be followed, and that the Union
                            of South Africa should be urged to explain its situation and problem,
                            and not just be huffy about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said there was some
                            indication that the Soviets themselves would favor what we called a
                            “hortatory” resolution. Apparently they did not want the Security
                            Council to be permanently seized with the question, so that it could
                            come up again in the forum of the General Assembly where it could be
                            effectively debated.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated agreement with the President. He then
                            referred to the speech that he had made when he was recently in South
                            Africa. He wanted the change to come from inside the country and felt
                            that outside pressure would just get the South Africans’ back up.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in our own country he had always opposed extreme
                            laws on the colored question. He had felt it best to concentrate on
                            getting the negroes the right to vote and then let matters follow a
                            natural course. He then referred to his discussions <pb n="747"
                                xml:id="pg_747" facs="0777"/>with General de Gaulle on the emergent
                            African states.<note n="1" xml:id="d346fn1">Reference is to
                                conversations held during the President’s visit to Paris, September
                                2–4, 1959.</note> He said that de Gaulle had brought the subject up
                            4 times. He commented on the seriousness of the problem which these new
                            nations presented, saying that except for Liberia, which was an old
                            American problem, he felt that the British and the French should take
                            the lead in these countries.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then concluded this session of the talks by commenting
                            on the political situation in the Union of South Africa. He said that
                            the Boers and the British were about 50–50 in the country. However, the
                            Boers had gerrymandered the voting districts in order to assure
                            themselves a permanent majority. They were intense Calvinists who felt
                            themselves to be God’s anointed. They actually believed in slavery.
                            There was even a certain nobility in the tenacity and sense of
                            righteousness with which they held to their views.</p>

                        <p>Most important element of situation is that natives for first time have
                            demonstrated both to themselves and whites their power in terms of
                            withholding labor and disregarding basic laws such as pass system. The
                            Union Government’s suspension of enforcing the pass system, and
                            currently, the impunity with which non-whites demonstrated in urban
                            areas and caused authorities withdraw from whole native townships, all
                            have greatly encouraged urban natives. They are <pb n="748"
                                xml:id="pg_748" facs="0778"/>now more ready to follow leaders
                            calling for direct action than ever before, and leaders no longer are
                            thinking of very gradual revolution some time in the future. This
                            creates a most dangerous and explosive situation.</p>
                        <p>If, as seems likely, the government does not make a major concession, and
                            relies on further repression, the long-term outlook is for tests of
                            strength by the natives and increasing violence. This in time would turn
                            Union into virtually an armed camp, with the natives partially
                            controlling major locations and parts of reserves, and the country’s
                            economic system declining due to unreliable labor forces, sabotage,
                            decline of investment, and wasteful effort of having large numbers of
                            whites under arms. Any non-white rising would be put down with great
                            loss of life, mostly non-white.</p>
                        <p>Even if government makes concessions we do not see how, with the natives’
                            appetite whetted by these concessions, further disturbances can be
                            avoided as campaigns for minimum wage or other goals would then be
                            launched. Most probable is a relaxation onerous aspects apartheid
                            measures combined with increased repression. This combination will not
                            satisfy non-whites.</p>
                        <p>Further serious disorder is probable next few days. Stay-at-home campaign
                            might then peter out or leaders may call it off and cease direct action
                            for a short time to so prepare for a further test of strength. In
                            neither short nor long run is it likely that unrest will decline to what
                            was normalcy ten days ago.</p>
                        <p>The strains on the National Party and on Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VHF1"
                                >Verwoerd</persName> are many, and there is substantial criticism of
                            his leadership within Pariamentary Party and outside in Afrikaner
                            churches, universities, and business. There is remote possibility Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName> might lose control
                            of the caucus, if situation deteriorates markedly, and Party might
                            overnight change its leader and moderate some of its policies. More
                            likely is a palace revolution engineered within the tribes and national
                            parties. In either case such a government would have to adopt policies
                            well to the left of present day United Party platform if it were to have
                            any hope of stabilizing this situation.</p>
                        <p>Despite all these possibilities, Embassy is not yet prepared to write off
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName>. The fears and
                            prejudices of the Afrikaner rank-and-file, which has been fostered by
                            the National Party for many years, remain strong; and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName> as the strong man with a clear
                            forceful program may be strengthened within the Party by disorder and
                            world criticism, despite the qualms of many of the intellectual elite.

                            discussed the proposed Security Council resolution on South Africa with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Andrew J. Goodpaster</persName> in
                            several telephone conversations on March 30 and 31. A memorandum of a
                            March 30 conversation between the Secretary and the President reads as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“The President called to ask if the Secretary had spoken to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> about keeping the
                            resolution mild and the Secretary said he had called last night. The
                            Secretary explained <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> did
                            not have a text but he was going to try to get it tonight. Knowing of
                            the President’s interest, the Secretary wanted him to see it. The
                            President said he could not get over the feeling that although we were
                            in an entirely different position they have the right to say they want
                            to make progress in their way. The President said if we get too tough
                            there could be a resolution that would make us awfully red faced. The
                            Secretary said the South Africans had implied that. The meeting this
                            morning went well. It was not voted on but went through without
                            incident. The Afro-Asians haven’t agreed on anything. The President said
                            he did not want our defenses down. The Secretary said he had alerted
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> of how the President
                            felt and so had <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName>. He had
                            recommended no violence on either side in his speech. The President said
                            he had just wanted to check up on this.” (Eisenhower Library, Herter
                            Papers, Telephone Conversations)</p>
                        <p>On March 31, <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> informed
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> of a
                            Ceylonese-Ecuadoran draft resolution, which he thought was “surprisingly
                            mild,” although the United States was proposing some changes. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> informed the President, who
                            thought the resolution was “mighty tough” and suggested additonal
                            changes. Later that day, however, the President told <persName

                            “difficult conditions” under which <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> was working. He instructed <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> and tell him the
                            resolution was “something we will have to vote for if we can keep it to

                                22 statement as “another indication” of U.S. willingness to abandon
                                Europeans in Africa. It commented that the growing danger in the
                                Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was the tendency of Europeans
                                who felt isolated and abandoned to take refuge in xenophobia, and it
                                urged a U.S. statement expressing support for genuine multiracial

                        <p>At the 439th meeting of the National Security Council on April 1,
                            Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> discussed developments in South Africa during his
                            briefing on significant world developments, and a brief discussion
                            followed. The relevant portion of the memorandum of discussion by Deputy
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Executive Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMW2">Marion W. Boggs</persName>, dated April 2, reads
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought that the events in South Africa
                            had been well described in the press. The principal questions now were:
                            what is the shape of the future? and what political decisions are
                            needed? He believed the South African Government would be able to hold
                            the situation in check but noted that the blacks in South Africa had
                            gained a substantial victory for the first time in forcing the
                            abandonment of the identity papers system. This first victory would
                            probably spur the black population of South Africa on to attempt other
                            victories. However, very few arms were in the hands of the natives
                            because of past restrictions and penalties against the possession of
                            arms. This situation would provide an opportunity for exploitation by
                            the Soviet Bloc. Especially after the Congo becomes independent, there
                            would be great opportunities for smuggling arms to the natives of South
                            Africa. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said this problem would be with
                            us for a long time. He was discouraged at any possibility that a liberal
                            government would be formed in South Africa, or if formed would be able
                            to negotiate a workable settlement. He thought the present repressive
                            measures would continue. The President asked whether South Africa was
                            likely to withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said the South
                            African representative had remained in the room during <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council discussion of the
                            situation in South Africa and had asked for an opportunity to speak once
                            more on the question of principle, although not on the Security Council
                            Resolution. In direct answer to the President’s question, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said he believed not
                            even the South Africans knew what their future course of action in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be. The President asked
                            whether any nation had ever withdrawn from the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member
                            had ever withdrawn permanently; however, South Africa had withdrawn in
                            1955 and had returned to membership two years later. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> did not believe that the South Africans
                            would withdraw from the UN if they could avoid it.” (Eisenhower Library,

                            Affairs, had three long talks with me about what he said are

                        <p>He blamed US press and American committee on Africa for grossly
                            misleading American public on true state of affairs here, and went on to
                            add that State Department’s recent decision to admit Oliver Tambo<note

                            says is Communist, was regarded by his government as unfriendly act.</p>
                        <p>He then cited South Africa’s firm anti-Communist position in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, her armed contributions during great and
                            Korean wars and his government’s present willingness to react favorably
                            to our desire to conclude agreement with US on <gloss target="#t_NASA1"
                                >NASA</gloss> and Defense. He added that even though many South
                            Africans are commencing to think that a neutralist policy may be their
                            only alternative, his government will stand firmly with West against
                            Communism and that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName>
                            recently assured <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> to
                            this effect.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me why South Africa was getting such bad press in America
                            and listened carefully while I told him that in my opinion his racial
                            policies will always provoke an indignant press in both England and
                            America, and that until present government decides on less rigid
                            attitudes toward non-whites he can expect nothing else.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> then criticized England for
                            selling his country Centurian tanks which have little local use and said
                            that after attending Prime Ministers conference he had sounded Belgians
                            and Czechs on possibility of purchasing arms from them.</p>
                        <p>Turning to matter of his country’s relations with emerging black states
                            of Africa he told me ruefully that Nkrumah had embarrassed him at London
                            Prime Ministers conference by publicly taking back his invitation for
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> to visit Ghana. He also
                            commented somewhat bitterly on decision of new Congo Government withdraw
                            their invitation to <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> attend their
                            independence day celebrations and added that he had had a gold cigarette

                            tension.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. The recent wave of racial disturbances in the Union of South Africa
                            has reinforced our view that in that country the years ahead will be
                            characterized by increasing tension, culminating eventually—probably
                            after considerable bloodshed—in the end of white domination.
                            Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the white minority, with all
                            the powers of a modern state at its disposal, and with a firm
                            determination to use them, will be able to maintain its dominance for
                            the next few years. (Para. 22)</p>
                        <p>2. Despite their number, the Africans are presently too weak and
                            disorganized to mount a broad and sustained campaign of resistance in
                            the face of the means of coercion available to the white community.
                            Nevertheless, localized strikes, boycotts, and other manifestations,
                            touched off by some specific grievances or incidents, will probably
                            flare up more frequently over the next few years. The more activist
                            non-white elements are likely to turn to terrorism. Africans outside the
                            Union will probably find means of furnishing at least small amounts of
                            arms and other material support to the Africans within the Union.
                            (Paras. 11–15, 23)</p>
                        <p>3. Continuation of internal strife in this manner will further increase
                            racial tensions in the community and magnify the difficulties of
                            maintaining white dominance. It may provoke a number of Asian-African
                            states—and perhaps others—to adopt economic sanctions against South
                            Africa. It will lead to some local economic dislocations within the
                            country, and will further reduce South Africa’s ability to attract the
                            investment capital, both foreign and domestic, which is needed for the
                            country’s continued prosperity. (Paras. 24–25)</p>
                        <p>4. At present the rather substantial structure of influence which the
                            Communists had established within the leadership of the older non-white
                            political movements in South Africa appears to have been hard hit by
                            recent events. Since the development of a new apparatus will probably
                            have to be started at the local level, it cannot be accomplished
                            rapidly. The Communists will be hampered by the absence of reliable and
                            numerous African cadres. Over the longer run, however, with their
                            conspiratorial skills and their ability to get material support from the
                            Bloc, Communists may come to exercise important influence within the
                            protest movement in the Union. (Para. 16)</p>
                        <p>5. Although the white community generally supports the government’s
                            efforts to stamp out African dissidence, recent events have aroused
                            increased misgivings, even within the dominant Nationalist Party, as to
                            the moral, economic, and international implications of the government’s
                                <hi rend="italic">apartheid</hi> policy. Within another year or two,
                            the growth of this feeling will probably begin to force some easing of
                            the government’s more onerous racial restrictions, but no comprehensive
                            accommodation <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0785"/>to non-white
                            aspirations is likely. Probable government concessions are likely to
                            have no more than a temporary calming effect, and probably will only
                            stimulate pressure for further change. (Paras. 17–21)</p>
                        <p>6. Growing world disapproval of its racial policies will probably push
                            South Africa into an increasingly isolated and controversial position in
                            international affairs. There is at least an even chance that it will be
                            forced out of the Commonwealth if it carries out its plans to become a
                            republic. South Africa will almost certainly be a target in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for the growing number of Afro-Asian
                            members, but it is unlikely to withdraw unless sanctions are voted
                            against it. Given the vehemence of both Afro-Asian and South African
                            feeling, the Western powers will find it increasingly difficult to avoid
                            offending one side or the other. (Paras. 26–27)</p>

                        <p>DEAR MR. WILLIAMS: I am writing to you to confirm our conversation of
                            August 16, 1960,<note n="1" xml:id="d353fn1">No record of this
                                conversation has been found. On August 15, Hare met with Deputy

                                Robert H. Knight and Lieutenant General D.N. Yates, Deputy Director
                                of Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Yates
                                reported on a survey trip investigating sites in South Africa and
                                Bechuanaland for a proposed missile and satellite tracking station.

                            concerning the proposal of the Department of Defense to secure the
                            approval of the South African Government for the establishment of a
                            facility in the Union in connection with the Department’s missile and
                            satellite program, and the Department of State’s agreement to enter into
                            negotiations for that purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0786"/>
                        <p>As you are aware, the survey and briefing trip to South Africa by General
                            Yates and his party was based on the understanding between our
                            Departments that the United States would not alter its basic policy
                            toward the Union of South Africa in order to secure the approval of the
                            South African Government to the establishment of the proposed facility.

                            Yates to date indicate that the South Africans will not raise this
                            point, should they do so during the course of any negotiations on this
                            subject, we would abandon our plan to have the facility in the Union of
                            South Africa.</p>
                        <p>As I outlined during our discussion, agreement was reached with Mr.
                            Knight and General Yates that, in the event political developments in
                            the African area result in the proposed facility becoming a net
                            disadvantage to United States interests, it would be removed. It was
                            also decided there should be no publicity by the U.S. concerning the
                            negotiations or the establishment or operations of the facility. We
                            should assume, however, that the existence of the facility will become
                            known and may be subjected to attack and misrepresentation. Accordingly,
                            it was agreed that a public information policy should be prepared for
                            contingency use which would be honest and forthright and which would be
                            based on the following points: (a) the purpose of the facility is
                            research and development related to military purposes; (b) it is in no
                            sense a military operational installation; and (c) a civilian contractor
                            manages the facility which is maintained and operated by civilian
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>In view of the potential political implications in Africa of the
                            establishment of the facility, I believe that representatives of our
                            Departments, in Washington and in the Union of South Africa, should
                            maintain close liaison on developments which may affect the
                                facility.<note n="3" xml:id="d353fn3">A letter from Assistant

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName>, who was on a two-day
                            visit to Washington from New York, where he is attending the Fifteenth
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session, called to pay his
                            respects to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>In referring to the Soviet Premier’s activities in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2"
                                >Louw</persName> stated that since <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s departure the Soviet <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> delegation has been doing everything it can to create
                            difficulties and to embarrass Secretary General Hammarskjold.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> must return to South
                            Africa by November on matters relative to the South African budget, he
                            had sought to get the agreement of the Fourth Committee for him to speak
                            on the Southwest Africa item in the near future, leaving the debate on
                            this subject in its present position on the agenda. He had been
                            unsuccessful as a result of Ethiopia’s objection, despite the fact that
                            South African troops had liberated Ethiopia in World War II.</p>
                        <p>He referred also to South Africa’s difficulties with Ghana, mentioning
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>’s peremptory
                            withdrawal at the Commonwealth Conference of the invitation he had
                            extended <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> to visit Ghana and
                            the restrictive measures Ghana had instituted with respect to flights
                            from South Africa to Ghana.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would like to take this opportunity to
                            express our thanks for the very fine cooperation we had received from
                            the South African Government, and from the Minister personally, in the
                            matter of our outer-space programs in so far as they involve South
                            Africa. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> informed the
                            Secretary that he highly appreciated the Secretary’s letter of gratitude
                            for the assistance rendered American evacuees into the Union at the time
                            of the Congo riots.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> remarked that he was glad
                            the Secretary had mentioned the matter of our outer-space programs,
                            since he had received a message in connection with the current
                            discussions concerning our <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0788"
                            />Defense Department project. The message raised three questions, (1)
                            whether the facilities would become South African property after
                            operations are completed, (2) whether the facilities would be operated
                            by South African personnel, and (3) whether South Africans would be
                            trained to operate the facilities. The establishment of facilities for
                            the project in the Union was a cause of concern to the South African
                            Government, since the outbreak of a local war between the United States
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, for example in Formosa,
                            would involve the question of South Africa’s neutrality. This would not
                            arise in the event of a total war. South Africa wished to be assured
                            that it will take over the facilities after completion of the operation,
                            but with rights reserved to the United States in the event of total war.
                            The matter had been referred to South African Government legal advisers
                            for consideration. No decision on our proposal would be taken, however,
                            until after our Presidential elections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> stated that he must be
                            frank in informing the Secretary that South Africa had been very unhappy
                            at the action we had taken in issuing a statement on the Sharpeville
                            riots. The incident had been distorted and exaggerated by the press. The
                            facts were that a mob of about 18,000 had stormed a small police force.
                            Tear gas could not be used owing to an unfavorable wind and the police
                            had been obliged to fire on the mob.</p>
                        <p>On matters relating to South Africa in the United Nations, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> noted that we had changed our
                            position in the last two years by voting against South Africa on the
                            resolution concerning South Africa’s racial policy. While not suggesting
                            that the United States should support South Africa on the issue, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> felt that the changed
                            position of the United States was unfortunate when South Africa was
                            evidencing every desire to be cooperative with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that we had always been frank with South Africa and
                            expressed the hope that real progress can be made in ameliorating racial
                            conditions in the Union. While we have always fully appreciated the
                            difficulties of the problem, we cannot support South Africa’s official
                            racial policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> replied
                            that he does not ask for our support and remarked that South Africa is
                            already making considerable headway. Questioned by the Secretary as to
                            whether he referred to economic advancement, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> answered in the negative, and
                            stated that the advancement was being made in the political sphere. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> went on to say that the
                            position of the tribal natives was quite different from that of other
                            natives. Two Bantu Territorial Authorities have been established and are
                            functioning very well. The tribal natives are perfectly happy with their
                            organizational set-up and in time will achieve self-governing status.
                            The South African Government, <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0789"
                            />Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> said, spends five to
                            six times more per capita on development of the African than does any
                            other country on the Continent.</p>
                        <p>Referring to criticism of the forced carrying of reference books by the
                            Bantus, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> stated that all
                            South Africans, whites and non-whites, are required to carry identity
                            cards. For the urban Bantus these serve to protect them in getting work
                            and housing since they are a means of controlling the 750,000 African
                            immigrants from neighboring territories. Raising the question to why
                            South Africa does not grant a qualified vote to the non-whites, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> said, in citing Rhodesia
                            and Nyasaland, that experience has shown the qualified vote satisfies
                            nobody. The Blacks, according to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2"
                                >Louw</persName>, want everything or nothing. The alternative to a
                            qualified vote was a full vote and the whites of South Africa had no
                            wish for a nation of mixed-blood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> described the history of
                            the early European settlements in South Africa and compared the position
                            of their present day descendants with those of North and South America.
                            The position of the whites in South Africa was different from that of
                            the whites in other African countries. The South African whites were a
                            permanent part of the population and had no other place to which they
                            could go.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> referred to a statement
                            by Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker that there should be no double
                            standard. He could not understand why criticism should be levelled at
                            South Africa and not at other countries when riots occur, mentioning
                            specifically the recent disturbances in Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
                            He believed that the United States should try to appreciate South
                            Africa’s position and mentioned Ambassador Wailes, who had served in the
                            Union, as one American individual who thoroughly understood the
                            situation in South Africa. He referred to a letter of Mason Sears to the
                                <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> in which Mr. Sears
                            said, “It might prove extremely effective if a U.N. “presence” could be
                            established in the heart of South Africa before racial unrest gets out
                            of hand”. As Mr. Sears had signed himself as “Former U.S. Representative
                            on the U.N. Trusteeship Council”, Mr <persName corresp="#p_LEH2"
                                >Louw</persName> indicated concern that the views expressed in the
                            letter by Mr. Sears might be interpreted as U.S. Government policy.</p>
                        <p>South Africa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> stated, was
                            anxious to cooperate with the United States, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CPK1">Crowe</persName> and his predecessors, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHA3">Byroade</persName> and Ambassador
                            Wailes, could testify. The time may come, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LEH2">Louw</persName> continued, when South Africa could
                            be a worthwhile ally of the United States. South Africa, he pointed out,
                            had never voted to interfere in the domestic affairs of another country
                            and recalled that the President of the United States in a statement on
                            one occasion had made a point against interference in another country’s
                            internal affairs.</p>

                                    the U.S. Delegation to the 15th Session of the U.N. General

                        <p>Senator Morse called me from New York at about 12:30 to ask for a change
                            in the voting instructions in regard to the Resolution before Committee
                            IV involving the recommendation for the despatch of the Committee on
                            Southwest Africa to go to Southwest Africa on a Committee of
                                Inquiry.<note n="2" xml:id="d355fn2">Reference is to an 11-power
                                draft resolution, a revised version of a draft resolution proposed
                                on November 24 by Guinea, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Togo, and Tunisia;
                                see U.N. docs. A/C.4/L.653 and A/C.4/L.653/Rev.1 and Rev.2.</note>
                            Senator Morse said that they had worked very hard to have certain parts
                            of the original Ghanaian Resolution modified and he felt it would be
                            very detrimental to the U.S. standing, therefore, to abstain on the
                            Resolution as a whole. He said the Italian Delegation had suggested a
                            procedure which they intended to follow and which Senator Mores hoped we
                            could do likewise. This would involve voting on operative paragraph 3 of
                            the Resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">Operative paragraph 4 of the
                                final resolution.</note> — the one providing for the Committee to go
                            to Southwest Africa first—on which vote the U.S. would abstain. If, as
                            was expected, however, this paragraph still carried, the U.S., after
                            having made its position plain on the Committee by abstention, would
                            then vote in favor of the Resolution. I told the Senator we would look
                            into this matter and I would call him back.</p>
                        <p>After discussion with the Staff of <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and
                            other interested Officers of the Department, I called Senator Morse back
                            and said that we did not see how we could vote in favor of the
                            Resolution quite apart from the Committee paragraph because of its very
                            extreme text. I also pointed out to him that in terms of references, the
                            Committee seemed <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0791"/>to go beyond
                            the requirements of Class “C” mandate which the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> had specifically certified as being the only
                            international agreement binding on the Union of South Africa in this
                                respect.<note n="4" xml:id="d355fn4">In an advisory opinion of July

                                mandate” refers to the classification of mandated territories in

                                Bevans 55.</note> Senator Morse pointed out that the language in
                            paragraph 2 condemning the Union of South Africa had been changed to
                            disapproval. He further questioned the legal interpretation of the
                            Department of State in regard to the problem of the mandate. I told him
                            that in view of the change in language to which he referred which we had
                            not known about, we would have a further look at the matter. However, on
                            further examination, it was the general consensus in the Department that
                            we could not support the precedent of attempting to send a Committee to
                            a country against that country’s wishes, nor could we, as the language
                            indicated, go beyond the requirements of the mandate.</p>
                        <p>At three o’clock, Senator Morse telephoned me and I told him that our
                            final decision was to abide by the original instructions and abstain on
                            the whole Resolution. Senator Morse said he would accept the decision
                            but wishes to state that “we were making one of the greatest mistakes”
                            that we had ever made in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that
                            we would have a bad time, not only in Committee IV, but again when this
                            matter came to the floor of the Assembly. I told him we had carefully
                            considered all the factors involved, but we felt that we would be in
                            worse shape after we voted for a Resolution with which we disagreed on
                            so many points.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, following Senator Morse’s first call, Mr. Wallner called
                            up Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJJ2">Wadsworth</persName> who
                            confirmed his support of Senator Morse’s opinion, but said, of course,
                            they would abide by our instructions.<note n="5" xml:id="d355fn5">The
