                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102-138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The editor of this volume, which was compiled in 1991 and 1992, is convinced that
                    it meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing. Although this volume records policies and events of more than 30 years
                    ago, the statute of October 28, 1991, allows the Department until 1996 to reach
                    the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 3 years (1961-1963) of the administration of <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                        >Kennedy</persName>'s administration.</p>
                <p>This volume presents documentation on U.S. policy toward North Africa and
                    selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Compilations are included on general
                    U.S. policy toward Africa and toward the North Africa region as well as on the
                    countries of North Africa (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia) and selected
                    countries or regions in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Guinea, the Horn of Africa,
                    Portuguese Africa, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and South Africa).
                    The record of a country's relations with the United States was selected for
                    inclusion in the volume where major national U.S. interests were perceived at
                    the time or subsequently. U.S. involvement in the Congo crisis is covered
                    separately in <ref target="frus1961-63v20">Volume XX</ref>.</p>
                <p>A separate <ref target="frus1961-63v17-21mSupp">microfiche supplement</ref>
                    presents additional documents on many of the countries and regional areas
                    covered in the print volume, but also includes documents on U.S. policies toward
                    a number of countries that were not included in the print volume. These
                    countries and regions are: Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Ivory Coast, Kenya,
                    Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Rwanda-Burundi, Senegal, Sudan, Tanganyika,
                    Togo, Uganda, and the Entente countries (Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Niger, and
                    Dahomey). Records of meetings between African leaders and President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> are, if not printed in the volume,
                    included in the supplement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editor believes that in terms of
                    access <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>this volume was prepared in
                    accordance with the standards and mandates of this statute, although access to
                    some records was restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p>The editor has had complete access to all the retired records and papers of the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the special
                    decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and
                    division levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which
                    contain the records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. Certain
                    intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Documents were added to one compilation that was still in the
                    declassification process. Arrangements have been made for Department historians
                    to have access to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the
                    National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
                    Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of this documentation has been made
                    available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks
                    to the consent of these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
                    Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants, and to material at the
                    National Defense University, particularly the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1"
                        >Maxwell Taylor</persName> Papers and the <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lyman
                        Lemnitzer</persName> Papers.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided steadily expanding
                    access to Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those
                    records still in the custody of that Agency. Department of State historians'
                    access is arranged by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of
                    Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State and <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the procedural
                    and scholarly aspects of the access. The editor determined that the publication
                    of this volume should not be postponed pending the discovery of additional
                    important documentation at the Central Intelligence Agency. If such
                    documentation is found by Department of State historians, it will be included in
                    a subsequent <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume.</p>

                        Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in a
                    microfiche supplement or in bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the
                    Foreign Relations series. Individual compiler-editors vary these criteria in
                    accordance with the particular issues and the available documentation. The
                    compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in accordance with
                    their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of scholarship. In
                    selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave priority to
                    unpublished classified records, rather than previously published records (which
                    are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>

                        Selected for <ref target="frus1961-63v21">Foreign Relations, 1961-1963,
                            Volume XXI</ref></hi></p>
                <p>The documentation printed in this volume focuses on U.S. policy toward Africa,
                    the formulation of U.S. policy, and on the most significant aspects of U.S.
                    political, economic, and military relationships with African governments.
                    Documents were selected that highlight policy discussions within the U.S.
                    Government, with particular emphasis on the highest level at which policy on a
                    particular subject was determined, that reveal policy positions and internal
                    differences over policy, and that summarize developments or positions regarding
                    an issue. The records of conversations with foreign leaders both abroad and in
                    Washington that particularly illuminated U.S. relations with those countries
                    were included. Space constraints precluded the inclusion of the substantial body
                    of documentation from Embassies and from agencies in Washington on internal
                    developments in African countries. Embassy reportage is limited to particularly
                    significant cables that may have influenced the making of U.S. policy on the
                    most critical issues. A number of relevant documents that conveyed finished
                    intelligence on Africa to U.S. policymakers, in particular National Intelligence
                    Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates, are included, but no
                    effort was made to document the wider role of intelligence in the formulation or
                    execution of policy.</p>
                <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> made the major foreign
                    policy decisions during his Presidency, and the editor tried to document his
                    role as much as possible. <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>The role of
                    White House and National Security Council Staff members in providing information
                    and advice to the President grew during this period. The editor accordingly
                    selected memoranda that presented to the President the views and recommendations
                    of his White House advisers. Formal approved policy papers were rare in the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> administration, and internal
                    discussions between the President and his advisers were not always recorded. The
                    editor sought to document Presidential decisions by drawing upon the best
                    material available. The Department of State continued to play a leading role in
                    formulating foreign policy and providing advice on foreign policy matters to the
                    President, and it played the principal role in exchanges of view and
                    negotiations on policy matters with foreign governments. The volume includes
                    documentation on a range of lesser policy decisions that did not reach the
                    President or were resolved in the Department of State or other foreign affairs
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>The issues covered in the North African compilations include U.S. support for
                    French President De Gaulle's announced program of self-determination for Algeria
                    and U.S. relations with the newly-established Algerian government after July
                    1962. Material is included on U.S. economic and military assistance to Libya,
                    Morocco, and Tunisia; the importance of the U.S. airbases and communications
                    facilities in Libya and Morocco; and U.S. withdrawal from the Moroccan bases in
                    December 1963. U.S. support for a negotiated settlement of the French-Tunisian
                    clash over the French naval base at Bizerte is documented, as is U.S. support
                    for peaceful settlement of the 1963 Algerian-Moroccan border conflict.</p>
                <p>The compilations on Sub-Saharan Africa focus on expanding U.S. economic and
                    military aid to the newly-independent nations of Africa and U.S. efforts to
                    prevent the nations of the region from falling under Soviet domination.
                    Documentation is included on U.S. policy concerns such as the U.S. decision to
                    proceed with aid for Ghana's Volta River project, the strategic importance of
                    the U.S. military base at Kagnew Station in Ethiopia, and U.S. efforts to find a
                    modus vivendi between Ethiopia and Somalia.</p>
                <p>The Southern African compilations document U.S. support for peaceful transitions
                    to stable, multi-racial societies in the white-ruled countries of Southern
                    Africa. The documentation on Portuguese Africa shows the tension within U.S.
                    policy, as the United States sought to balance its concern over Portugal's
                    colonial policies in Angola and Mozambique against its desire to negotiate
                    renewal of the Azores Base Agreement with its <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                        >NATO</gloss> ally, Portugal. The Rhodesian compilation documents U.S.
                    support for British efforts to bring about full participation of the African
                    populations of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the political
                    process. The South African compilation deals with conclusion of a U.S. missile
                    and satellite tracking station agreement with <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX"
                        facs="0009"/>South Africa, and U.S. opposition to proposed mandatory U.N.
                    economic sanctions against that country, as well as continuing U.S. opposition
                    to the policy of apartheid and the unilateral U.S. embargo on arms shipments to
                    South Africa announced in August 1963.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams
                    from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in the Department of
                    State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda
                    of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the
                    source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>An unnumbered source note to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>has been
                    previously published, and this information has been included in the source
                    footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,

                <p>This volume was not reviewed by the Advisory Committee, but the Committee
                    supported the successful effort by the Historian's Office to declassify (with

                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, completed in 1994, resulted in
                    the decision to withhold less than one percent of the documents originally
                    selected; four documents were not declassified. The remaining documents provide
                    an account of the major foreign policy issues confronting and the policies
                    undertaken by the U.S. Government concerning Africa during this period.</p>

                                1963, the Department of State continued to use the decimal central
                                file system. In February 1963, the Department changed to a
                                subject-numeric central file system. For the period January
                                1961-January 1963, documents in classes 200 (protection of
                                interests), 300 (international organizations and conferences), 400
                                (trade relations), 500 (cultural relations), 600 (international
                                relations), 700 (internal political and national defense affairs),

                        <p>In giving Morocco and Tunisia their independence in 1956, France expected
                            to remain in very close association with them. “Independence within
                            interdependence” was the phrase coined to describe the hoped-for
                            relationship. France, it was thought, would continue to support the two
                            North African nations financially and in return would keep its military
                            bases and obtain special guarantees for its citizens and investments. In
                            recognition of France's paramount role, the U.S. at the time said that
                            any aid we might give Morocco or Tunisia was intended to supplement (not
                            supplant) French efforts.</p>
                        <p>Events soon belied these hopes. The nationalistic prejudices aroused in
                            Morocco and Tunisia clashed with French short-sightedness (and short
                            temper)—over bases, over French privileges, over disputed territory and
                            over the other sequels of French colonization in North Africa. The
                            Algerian war made it certain that a stable relationship was for the time
                            impossible. Morocco and Tunisia were bound to support the <gloss
                                target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> and the French were bound to resent
                            such support. The <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> depended heavily
                            on the sanctuary of Tunisian and Moroccan territory. Border
                            transgressions by both the French Army and the <gloss target="#t_FLN1"
                                >FLN</gloss> exacerbated the tensions between France and its former
                            protectorates to the point of rupture.</p>
                        <p>The remarkable fact is that French influence still counts for so much in
                            Morocco and Tunisia. This testifies to the underlying importance of the
                            French-North African interrelationship. Some 200,000 French nationals
                            (of 350-400,000 before independence) still live in Morocco and some
                            50-60,000 (of 150-200,000 before independence) still live in Tunisia.
                            Morocco continues to rely on some 15,000 French advisers, technicians
                            and teachers and Tunisia, while it is much less dependent on such help
                            than Morocco, still employs several thousand French teachers and other
                            experts. France continues to provide a protected market for Moroccan and
                            Tunisian exports and French investments, particularly in Morocco, <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0030"/>still account for most of the
                            modern sector of the North African economies. In both countries French
                            is the second language of all educated persons and the French liberal
                            press and French culture exert a powerful influence.</p>
                        <p>On the governmental level, nevertheless, France, because of the obduracy
                            of Morocco and Tunisia in post-independence negotiations, suspended
                            virtually all direct financial aid to these two countries. This left a
                            void which we have felt it necessary to fill both for the sake of our
                            own national interests and to preserve some position for the West. In
                            both countries the U.S. has become the principal source of direct
                            foreign economic aid. In Morocco, U.S. aid has reached an annual level
                            of $40 to $50 million, in Tunisia $20 to $25 million—two of our largest
                            aid programs in Africa. We also entered into modest military supply
                            programs when it appeared that Morocco and Tunisia, in desperation,
                            would seek arms from the Soviet bloc. France has not been happy about
                            the expansion of U.S. military and economic aid, but has acquiesced in
                            it while trying to insure that we consult France in advance of any new
                            steps and showing great sensitivity over an indication that we might
                            permanently undermine the French position. As elsewhere in Africa, the
                            French have been especially pained by our English-language teaching
                            programs which they see as a permanent danger to the predominance of
                            French culture.</p>
                        <p>We have taken great pains to persuade France that we are not seeking a
                            predominant role in North Africa and that we hope France will play a
                            greater role there when the Algerian war is over. We have argued, at the
                            same time, that so long as we have important interests in the area, such
                            as our bases in Morocco, and that so long as the controversies
                            separating France and North Africa endanger the Western position
                            generally in the area, the U.S. does not feel it can abandon Morocco and
                            Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>One of the most hopeful auguries for the future of the Maghreb (Morocco,
                            Algeria and Tunisia) lies in the interrelationships between the
                            economies of France and that area. France is an important labor market
                            for North African workers and provides outlets for North African grain,
                            wine, phosphates, edible oil and petroleum. The great reservoirs of
                            natural gas developed by French enterprise in Algeria can no doubt
                            provide all of North Africa with a cheap source of power on which to
                            base an expanding industry, and with cheap power it may even become
                            possible to desalinize water profitably and thus to bring vast new
                            desert areas under cultivation.</p>

                                    committed to the Soviet bloc nor are they safely aligned with

                                <item>The two major motivations in the area are nationalism and the
                                    demand of the people for a better life. When a choice has to be
                                    made between what is economically rational and politically
                                    expedient, we must expect that nationalism will cause political
                                    expediency to win out every time.</item>

                                    states concerned to meet the self-help criteria. At the same
                                    time, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> remains vital for
                                    political reasons, and, where we have military bases, for that
                                    reason as well.</item>

                                    nationalism sweeping through those countries. Nevertheless, so

                                    and military assistance, or in due course altering our

                                    success. The danger was an increasing one, however. The

                                <item>There was a unanimous and strong feeling that the ambassadors

                                    shorter and simpler, and that more time should be allowed
                                    between the approach to the foreign government and the crucial

                            <item>—Despite many present uncertainties in the North African picture,
                                the West's position now is substantially better than could have been
                                foreseen only a little over a year ago during the final throes of
                                the Algerian War. That war left its scars on the West's relations
                                with the area as the increased Bloc presence there attests. But the
                                War's end has permitted the end of what was for many of North
                                Africa's governing elite a painful estrangement. They have actively
                                sought to resume close ties with Western Europe. France has risen to
                                its opportunities and has actively pursued policies of rapprochement
                                with each of the North African countries (though traces of
                                vindictiveness are discernible in the manner in which they are going
                                about their Bizerte military installation shutdown). The United
                                States and other Western European countries have similarly
                                contributed <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0034"/>to a reinforcement
                                of the North African swing toward the West. For the United States
                                the problem has become less one of finding means to build North
                                African-European relationships than to discern ways to encourage and
                                perpetuate ties now in existence, while at the same time defining
                                and carrying out a supplemental role consistent with US interests
                                and objectives.</item>

                            <item>—The Bloc, too, has found a different situation in the area than
                                it probably anticipated a year ago. Morocco and Tunisia are less
                                hospitable to Bloc overtures than they were under the stresses of
                                the Algerian War. Algeria remains a relatively soft target for the
                                Bloc but has not become, as was conceivable a year ago, a beachhead
                                for Bloc domination of North Africa. In all three countries an
                                intense pride in independence has been a barrier to the Bloc. Faced
                                with stickier going than expected, the Bloc has not made a major
                                resource commitment to subvert the area. Its interest remains high,
                                however, and we may expect the Bloc to continue to be attracted by
                                the opportunities this important strategic area offers. At the
                                moment Algeria is particularly vulnerable; the Bloc has not been
                                remiss and recent months have seen a substantially increased Bloc
                                presence there.</item>
                            <label>III.</label>
                            <item><p>—In quantitative terms, the American presence in the area tends
                                    to decline. The Algerian War's end has sharply reduced the
                                    danger of a sudden North African spin into the Bloc orbit.
                                    Western Europe, again politically acceptable in the area, is
                                    helping to take up the assistance slack in Morocco and Algeria.
                                    Our assistance to Tunisia represents a major contribution to a
                                    soundly conceived development plan, but Western European aid is
                                    increasing. Our strategic presence likewise is declining as our
                                        <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> operation is pulled out
                                    of Morocco. All of this adumbrates a smaller US material
                                    involvement in the area and lessens the possibility that we will
                                    face assuming the major share in foreign assistance to North
                                    Africa.</p>
                                <p>There is nothing here, however, to lull the US into a false sense
                                    of security. Deep-seated economic and political forces bid fair
                                    to keep the area disturbed. Morocco's King seems to be in
                                    control but his efforts to set his rule in a democratic,
                                    constitutional frame, in which he would remain pre-eminent, are
                                    encountering disruptive opposition. The political foundations of
                                    newly independent Algeria are still settling as <persName
                                        corresp="#p_BBA1">Ben Bella</persName> goes about
                                    eliminating rivals, consolidating his power and attempting to
                                    cope with Algeria's massive economic problems. Tunisia appears
                                    relatively serene, but only last December it was shaken by a
                                    plot aiming at Bourguiba's assassination, and opposition voices
                                    continue to be heard. Bloc interest persists and a flexible US
                                    policy, alert to the special and not always predictable demands
                                    of the troubled period through which North Africa is passing, is
                                    essential to protect US interests in the area.</p></item>

                            <item>—Talk of North African unity has been more abundant since the end
                                of the Algerian War, but objective analysis discloses little basis
                                for anticipating such a development in any comprehensive form,
                                embracing spheres of major economic and political interest.
                                Political differences, often tied to personal rivalries among
                                leaders, cut deeply. The parallel nature of North African economies
                                gives little real incentive to broad scale, intimate economic
                                cooperation, though the desirability of offering a common front to
                                the challenge of the Common Market may provide a spur to cooperation
                                in limited areas. North African nations clearly intend to pursue
                                their destinies in the near future through national channels; it
                                behooves the United States to continue to address itself to the
                                nations of the area as individual entities and to appraise any
                                proposed US involvement in regional undertakings first from the
                                standpoint of our relations with the individual nations
                                involved.</item>
                            <label>V.</label>
                            <item>—The skeptical view we take of chances for comprehensive North
                                African unity should not imply hostility for the concept. We look
                                with favor on North African efforts to promote greater regional
                                cooperation and greater cooperation with Western Europe. Such
                                efforts—under leadership not substantially less well disposed toward
                                the West than that presently in control—will tend strongly to damp
                                intra-regional tensions and strengthen the region in all respects
                                against external threats. We can conceive of instances in which US
                                assistance could be helpful. But, given the lack of forceful
                                momentum behind North African unity at present, we would be badly
                                miscast in a leading role in a halting process whose final issue is
                                so uncertain. North African unity, though desirable, is not the key
                                to the achievement of US aims in the area; we are wise to leave
                                unity initiatives to the North Africans themselves.</item>

                        <p>This paper is a revised version of the original draft which was discussed
                            at the Secretary's Policy Planning Meeting on July 30, 1963.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d5fn1">See <ref target="#d4">Document 4</ref>.</note> This
                            version takes into account the discussion and views expressed by various
                            officers in the Department of State and outside.</p>
                        <p>The principal conclusion of the paper is that while certain trends, now
                            in progress, point to a growth of some degree of regional unity, they
                            are balanced by other trends which point in exactly the opposite
                            direction. The result of the study indicates, therefore, that
                            significant movement toward unity in Northwest Africa is unlikely
                            irrespective of US or other attempts to foster or delay this process.
                            Similarly, the challenge of the common market will be felt by the
                            different countries in different ways and will probably not be a
                            significant spur to unification. Activities of the Soviet Union,
                            likewise, will be differently felt in the three countries of Northwest
                            Africa. The governments of the three are in actual or potential conflict
                            on territorial and ideological issues, and their leaders are rivals.</p>
                        <p>Thus, while some degree of regional integration would be beneficial,
                            particularly in areas of economic planning and modernization, and while
                            an important legacy of the French period is an East to West
                            communications infrastructure, significant cooperation is judged to be
                            unlikely.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the present paper be considered as completing the
                            Policy Planning task until such time as significant developments within
                            North Africa make useful a revision.</p>

                            <p>Although there are acknowledged advantages to the United States in a
                                closer form of association among the countries of the North African
                                Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya), there appears to be
                                little current basis on which to anticipate such a development.
                                Further, there would appear to be little basis for U.S. policy to
                                promote actively any formal association in the political, military
                                or economic realms, <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0037"/>although
                                discreet help toward closer cooperation may be possible in the
                                economic field. U.S. policy must continue to address itself to the
                                individual national entities of the North African littoral, taking
                                full account of the heightened consciousness of national identity
                                which has characterized North African nations since they achieved
                                independence. This does not mean that the U.S. should view the
                                possibilities of association or union negatively. As a matter of
                                policy, we should remain open-minded and alert for opportunities to
                                further Maghreb cooperation and Maghreb ties with Western Europe.
                                U.S. and Western aid programs are particularly important in the
                                latter case.</p>
                            <p>In Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia lip service is paid to the notion of
                                eventual Maghreb unity, but currently and for the foreseeable
                                future, nothing more concrete is likely to be attempted. The
                                possibility of Maghrebian incorporation into a larger Arab union
                                seems even more distant though a loose confederative link between
                                Algeria and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> cannot be ruled
                                out. The underlying political differences and frictions, the
                                incompatibility of the royalist and republican regimes, the fact
                                that there is no economic basis for unity (they produce in a
                                parallel rather than complementary pattern) and the fact that each
                                is intensely national in aspect, all militate against organized
                                economic, political or military agreements leading toward unity in
                                any sector. This is not to indicate that advantages would not accrue
                                should a form of unity develop. Advantages of customs union,
                                specialization of industry (one steel mill complex for several
                                nations instead of competing mills), and the resultant economy in
                                labor forces, finance and materials are obvious. But it is difficult
                                to see any basis to hope for it today or to estimate foreseeable
                                times when it could develop into actuality.</p>
                            <p>In the same less than optimistic view, no political or military or
                                economic pact can be presently anticipated between the North African
                                countries and the countries of Southern Europe other than those
                                which now exist. All of the North African countries are now eager
                                for increased economic assistance from their former colonial lords.
                                France seems prepared to play a major role in Morocco, Tunisia, and
                                Algeria, while Italy appears ready to broaden its relations with
                                Libya. But to cement the relationships with a political pact would
                                clash with the Arab-African ideals of independence and
                                non-alignment.</p>
                            <p>North African abhorrence of formal political or military pacts with
                                the West does not foreordain deterioration of the Western position
                                in the area. On the contrary, the events of recent months give the
                                West cause for tempered optimism: Maghrebian communist parties have
                                been proscribed; the area's historical and cultural ties with the
                                West have been an important underlying counterforce to Bloc bids in
                                the area; and the intense pride in independence manifested by newly
                                independent Maghrebian countries has been a barrier to Bloc efforts
                                to gain influence. The <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0038"/>area
                                nevertheless remains vulnerable to Bloc subversion. All of the
                                countries, but particularly Algeria with its enormous economic
                                problems, offer opportunities to the Bloc. If North Africa does not
                                seem at the moment to be exposed to a major Bloc drive for power (on
                                the order of Soviet efforts in the Middle East in the mid-50's), it
                                is, assuredly, because of its economic weakness and political
                                uncertainties, a continuing target of opportunity for the Bloc.</p>
                            <p>Apart from aspects of cooperation in the official realms, cooperation
                                within the Maghreb and between the Maghreb and Europe takes place in
                                a number of unofficial and quasi-official fields: labor, education,
                                the professions, and commerce. To the extent these can be encouraged
                                they represent an effective aid to the ultimate objective of closer
                                ties.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. diplomatic establishment must be alert to any change in the
                                present political, military, or economic scenes in North Africa
                                which would augment North African ties per se or ties with the West,
                                or on the other hand a lessening of Western influence. U.S.
                                objectives are to preserve the North African ties which presently
                                exist with the West, to try to strengthen them when and where they
                                need strengthening and to rebuild them where they have been damaged;
                                to utilize our influence wherever feasible to provide a strong
                                economic base for this cooperation through strengthened North
                                    African-<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> ties; to present the
                                image of the U.S.A. as responsively enthusiastic toward helping the
                                new independent nations so that the alternative of turning toward
                                the Soviet Bloc will become less and less attractive. All of this is
                                consistent with the creation of a formal Maghreb association and
                                tangentially should promote it.</p>

                            special emissary Yazid. It was quickly apparent that I was being given a

                                State, Central Files, POL 32-1 ALG-MOR.</note> After a long wind-up
                            about peace-loving Algeria which simply wanted to develop in its own way
                            on its own socialistic model, he pinned the rose on the Moroccans for
                            trying to upset the <persName>Ben Bella</persName> regime as well as
                            seize the valuable iron deposits at Tindouf. His case was that Algeria
                            did not want a war with Morocco and had repeatedly offered to negotiate
                            “without any agenda” but that the Moroccans had consistently rejected
                            this. He said the Algerians were standing on an issue of principle. All
                            the African states at the <gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss> Conference
                            in Addis Ababa had agreed that the borders established during the
                            colonial period should be accepted and that no borders should be changed
                            by force. He understood that the US favored the <gloss target="#t_OAU1"
                                >OAU</gloss> and accepted the decisions of the Addis conference.
                            Therefore, where did the US stand on this question of principle? Would
                            we condone a Moroccan attempt to change by force an existing
                            frontier?</p>
                        <p>I evaded the issue, saying that we were neutral in this dispute and had
                            taken no position on the merits; however, we understood the question to
                            be what was the “border” between Morocco and Algeria in this area? The
                            Moroccans seemed to claim it was simply an administrative line which had
                            been frequently changed, and that the places in dispute were in fact on
                            their side of the “border.” In any case, I was sure we would not want to
                            get dragged into the middle of a dispute between two friends of ours
                            unless we were forced to do so. Our great concern was that a minor
                            border issue seemed to be blowing up into a major confrontation between
                            Algeria and Morocco, in which each side was claiming that the future of
                            its own regime was at stake. It seemed to us in the best interests of
                            both countries that this trend be reversed before other powers were
                            drawn into the situation and a choosing-up of sides resulted which would
                            make it very difficult for the US to stand aloof. The President had
                            amply demonstrated our friendly interest in Algeria, but we were on good
                            terms with the Moroccans too. They had provided us <gloss
                                target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases at a time when we needed them,
                            although we were getting out by agreement now. Both Algeria and Morocco
                            were young countries with major <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0048"
                            />internal problems which we were trying to help them surmount. A major
                            fight between them could only interfere with their domestic development;
                            this was worth every effort to avoid. We hoped a situation would not
                            develop in which the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and others came
                            so openly to the assist-ance of Algeria as to put great pressure on us,
                            the French, and the Spanish to give countervailing assistance to Morocco
                            and thus convert the issue into an East-West confrontation which would
                            help nobody. Were the issues involved in the border dispute of
                            sufficient seriousness to run this risk? Yazid said he fully understood
                            our position.</p>
                        <p>Yazid said they did not want to take the issue to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> precisely because it might prove
                            embarrassing to the US and France. What would we do, however, if the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> became involved? I responded that
                            all one could say at this point was that we would call the shots as we
                            saw them. However, if the issue blew up to the point where <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention seemed essential, I was sure
                            we would come down in favor of peacekeeping regardless of whether it
                            made one side or the other sore at us.</p>
                        <p>At the outset I told Yazid and Guellal that the President had very much
                            wanted to see <persName>Ben Bella</persName> if he came and regretted it
                            wasn't possible at this point. After expressing appreciation, Yazid said
                            that since he was a special emissary from Ben Bella, they had thought of
                            asking for an appointment but had concluded it would not be proper.
                            However, he hoped to present their case informally to certain key
                            Congressmen; it had been suggested he talk with Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. What did I think about their
                            using a family connection in this way? My own personal view was that it
                            was probably wiser not to try and exploit a family connection.</p>
                        <p>I stressed to Yazid the importance of not letting rumor, tendentious
                            press stories, and incipient misunderstandings get in the way of
                            US-Algerian relations. There had been too much of this recently. I hit
                            him hard on Algerian press allegations that US pilots were transporting
                            Moroccan troops. He was most apologetic, mentioning that he hoped to
                            help set the record straight at a press conference after his talk with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. They hoped to
                            exert more effective influence on the press, which he admitted was often
                            quite irresponsible. But the American press had its flaws too. I
                            countered that we hadn't yet nationalized our newspapers but if the
                            antics of their press were any guide, this didn't seem to do much good.
                            Yazid said he expected to tell <persName>Ben Bella</persName> not to be
                            so sensitive to US press stories, but that we must realize we were
                            dealing with a young and fairly inexperienced regime.</p>
                        <p>I asked Yazid what had happened to his mission to Marrakech, which at one
                            point seemed to be succeeding. He answered that he had sought a
                            cease-fire and return to positions as of 1 October but the Moroccans
                            insisted on holding Algerian territory. As for negotiations, they
                            insisted that these were possible only if border questions were
                            specifically on the agenda. So it was impossible to reach agreement.
                            When <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>Guellal began talking about
                            Moroccan aggression, I asked about the Hassan-Ferhat Abbas agreement of
                            1961 just published by the Moroccans, which seemed to indicate that the
                            two parties had agreed to negotiate the border issue. Yazid said that
                            the agreement had been in French but the Moroccans had made their own
                            slanted Arabic translation. As everybody knew, Ferhat Abbas couldn't
                            even read Arabic so he had been “had.”</p>
                        <p>As we parted I again mentioned our neutrality on the issue in dispute but
                            our strong feeling that this issue should not be permitted to lead to a
                            major to-do which would encourage outside intervention. We understood
                            Algeria's desire to develop in its own distinctively Algerian way; we
                            also recognized its right to accept assistance from any quarter and
                            fully expected that it would seek help from East and West. But we hoped
                            the Algerians would recognize that becoming too beholden to any single
                            outside power or group of powers would compromise their own freedom of
                            action over time.</p>
                        <p>We ended by my mentioning to Yazid that he and I were the same age but
                            the reason why I had so much more grey hair than he did was because of
                            the frustrations of trying to keep up with such volatile people as
                            Sukarno, Nehru, Nasser, and Ben Bella. He laughingly responded by
                            telling me that he tried to call <persName>Ben Bella</persName> in
                            Algiers last night and the American operator had asked him “do you mean
                            Algiers, Morocco?” However, he would not take this as an indication of
                            US policy.</p>

                            Moroccan-Algerian conflict:</p>
                        <p>We keenly regret emergence conflict which threatens disrupt stability and
                            development of Maghreb. Years of struggle leading to independ-ence have
                            left nations in area in desperate need period of tranquility to build
                            better life for its citizens. US, in sympathy aspirations area's
                            peoples, has contributed substantially to its economic development.
                            These contributions significant both in Morocco and in Algeria. In
                            latter our surplus food supplies of crucial importance in countering
                            effects post-independence food shortages.</p>
                        <p>In view our close and friendly relations with both countries we are and
                            intend to remain impartial in the present conflict. We have no intention
                            of becoming involved in substance of dispute over borders never formally
                            delimited to satisfaction of parties concerned. Instructions have been
                            given to US military personnel present in area to avoid any action
                            tending involve them directly or indirectly in this dispute.</p>
                        <p>US efforts will be bent toward encouraging early peaceful resolution
                            conflict either through direct negotiations or through good offices <pb
                                n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0051"/>other friendly countries. We
                            welcome efforts of <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName>
                            and other African and Arab statesmen to bring an early end to
                            hostilities and hope they will have full support other African states.
                            We are also in consultation <gloss target="#t_UNSYG1">UNSYG</gloss> who
                            having continuing discussions with Moroccan and Algerian
                            representatives. We believe any extension of this conflict or its
                            polarization along lines of East-West struggle would be extremely
                            regrettable and we will exert all our efforts to avoid this. In our view
                            increasingly sharp invective employed by press and radio in each country
                            against the other will hinder an early solution and is to be
                            deplored.</p>

                        <p>We have a quite disturbing report from a fairly reliable source that
                            Nasser has decided to go in big with help to <gloss target="#t_BB1"
                                >BB</gloss>, including substantial Egyptian troops. His reported
                            reason is that he wants to help <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> in
                            order to freeze the Soviets out since the Soviet embrace would be the
                            end of <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss>. Source says the real reason,
                            however, is that Gallal wants a dramatic “victory” to enhance his
                            prestige in the eyes of the Syrians and show them how powerful he
                            is.</p>
                        <p>We also have two ships with arms cargoes reported en route from Cuba.</p>
                        <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>
                        <p>If Algerians get all this help, it will be hard for us to keep turning
                            down Moroccan arms requests. Also Moroccans may just publicize fact we
                            are continuing to ship ammo, trucks, recoilless rifles, etc. under
                            existing <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program. This would justify
                            other side's intervention.</p>
                        <p>So our best bet is maximum effort to get a cease-fire and mediation
                            going. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is probably our best recourse
                            here since only he will have prestige and leverage. So I am pressing
                            along these lines. We'll also consider going to Nasser and telling him
                            that if he gives massive aid to <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> we
                            will have to counter with the Moroccans. I am not sure this would be a
                            good bet, however, (incidentally, if Nasser does intervene on big scale,
                            Faysal will be encouraged to smack his rear in Yemen).</p>

                                        had been correct and that the present border strife had been
                                        created by Ben Bella, aided and guided by Nasser, to serve
                                        as an excuse for his real objective, the destruction of the
                                        Moroccan monarchy. He repeated his plea for U.S. military
                                        aid, saying it could be channeled secretly through Spain,
                                        which had offered to help. The King said he desired a
                                        peaceful solution to this crisis, but felt that Nasser and
                                            <persName>Ben Bella</persName> would not honor any such

                                    concerned that what started as a frontier dispute not become on
                                    either side a far graver conflict between philosophies or
                                    systems. Should this happen, it would be most difficult to
                                    prevent outside powers from becoming far more heavily involved
                                    on both sides. I cannot believe this could serve either your
                                    interests or those of Morocco in the long run.</p>
                                <p>I would hope, therefore, that you would agree, Mr. President,
                                    that, given the grave threats posed by continued fighting to
                                    peace in the area, the failure to explore every reasonable means
                                    to find a common basis for a solution would be tragic.</p>

                                    both sides. Their initial declared positions would appear to
                                    thwart progress towards an end to the fighting. Our thoughts are
                                    of course in confidence. If they should in any way prove useful
                                    to your estimation, please advance them as your own, rather than
                                    as official views of the United States, adapted to the

                                Morocco just now is that, when this becomes public, it will seem to
                                justify Algerian arms requests to others. We're also in a poor
                                position to influence <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> against such
                                requests if we're simultaneously continuing to equip

                            <item>We can always reverse our policy well before it's too late, if it
                                becomes clear that <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> with <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>/Soviet/Cuban support is really out

                        </list>
                        <p>A shrewd calculation of our interests suggests that we have to stay loose
                            in these bloody disputes between third parties—precisely so they won't
                            become East-West issues in which we somehow tend to end up <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0062"/>stuck with the weaker side against the
                            stronger. In my part of the world, moreover, things are seldom what they
                            seem at first glance. For example, <gloss target="#t_NYT1">NYT</gloss>
                            this morning had Indians, not Paks, starting trouble in Kashmir;
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> blew up this morning
                            about Algerian capture of Figuig and this afternoon we hear Figuig is
                            still in Moroccan hands; <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> tells us it's
                            staying strictly out of Yemen war, yet its own people say that puppet
                            Sharif of Beihan sent 35 camel loads of arms to royalists, and is
                            actively conniving with Faysal; four months ago Hussein was accusing us
                            of being in bed with Nasser—now he's cosying up to Nasser and accusing
                            us of being pro-Baath.</p>
                        <p>We are presently evacuating Morocco except for a residual commo facility
                            at Kenitra. Yet we're still investing tens of millions a year. The more
                            arms aid we give Morocco now, the more <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss>
                            will seek elsewhere. So we risk a nice little Maghreb arms race in which
                            our costs go up and <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> leans further in
                            the wrong direction to satisfy his suppliers. Where is our interest
                            here?</p>
                        <p>Ben Bella is a pain and will remain so, but he's more likely to be around
                            for a while than Hassan. He seems to have done a good job so far of
                            out-maneuvering his opposition. I think most specialists would agree
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has even less life
                            expectancy than <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss>. So we also want to be
                            careful lest we end up backing the losing horse. Ferguson, who seems to
                            his managers back here to be pleading his client's case rather more than
                            ours, doesn't seem to be taking these longer range factors much into
                            account.</p>
                        <p>In sum, our interest is to avoid being drawn into disputes in a way which
                            will plague us, and cost us a lot more than we reckon at the outset,
                            until we see where more clearly we want to end up.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Algeria</hi>. The Secretary asked whether Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> had any recent
                            information as to how the Algerian problem was developing. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that in his talks
                            with Prime Minister Debre and Minister Joxe both had been much more
                            optimistic than on past occasions and had expressed the view that they
                            felt reasonably certain for the first time that the other side really
                            wanted to reach an agreement. He said he understood that in preliminary
                            negotiations agreement had been reached on a number of crucial problems
                            such as the Sahara, the stationing of French troops, the maintenance of
                            bases and of communications with Black Africa and the rights of the
                            European minority although this latter point still presented certain
                            difficulties. He said he considered it likely that formal negotiations
                            would begin within the next few weeks. He warned however that
                            difficulties could appear at the last moment. With Arabs, one could
                            never be certain whether agreements that had been reached would not
                            again become negotiable. Also, the Egyptians and the Soviets were
                            exercising pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GPRA1">GPRA</gloss> against
                            a negotiated settlement. Lastly, there was the threat from the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>. In the Metropole, the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> has been noisy but without any real
                            influence. The vast majority of the people in metropolitan France would
                            welcome a negotiated settlement of the Algerian conflict. In Algeria,
                            however, the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> was influential and
                            could cause trouble. Ambassador Alphand was confident <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"/>however that the Government would be
                            able to deal with these troubles.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that in
                            view of the fact that the outlook was favorable and that a negotiated
                            settlement appeared to be at hand it was important to do nothing that
                            might disturb this situation. He referred to the understanding which he
                            had had for several years that <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">French-Arab relations</hi>. The Secretary said the
                            constructive Algerian settlement would improve French relations with the

                            between France and Morocco. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName> said that there was a curious seesaw
                            relationship in North Africa: when French-Tunisian relations were bad,
                            French-Moroccan relations improved and vice versa. He agreed that an
                            Algerian settlement would have a salutary effect on French-Arab
                            relations but said that Egypt was an exception. He said the French had
                            disturbing reports from Egypt on the treatment inflicted upon the
                            arrested French officials who had been subjected to all kinds of

                        <p>On January 13, 1961, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
                            Livingston T. Merchant gave the following report during a Department of
                            State-Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting: “Mr. Merchant said he would like to
                            report to the Chiefs our assessment of the recent referendum on Algeria.
                            In France itself <persName>De Gaulle</persName> won over 75% of the
                            vote. Even when the non-voters are considered, 57% of the eligible
                            voters supported De Gaulle. Sixteen million Frenchmen voted yes, five
                            million no and five million abstained. In Algeria 70% of those voting
                            supported De Gaulle. In France the negative vote did not reflect success
                            on the part of the extreme right but was largely the communist
                            electorate. The results of the referendum were not as good as was
                            expected a month before the vote took place but were more favorable than
                            was anticipated on the eve of the referendum. We do not know if the
                                <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> will be willing to negotiate
                            with <persName>De Gaulle</persName> but the lull occurring after the
                            referendum gives us some feeling of optimism. We have no idea of how
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> plans to play his hand, how he will
                            negotiate. With respect to North Africa in general Mr. Merchant said in
                            the future we will want to get <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views
                            on certain aspects of Sino-Soviet involvement in the area. He said he
                            was considering the possibility of sending the Chiefs a letter
                            containing certain military questions in this regard. Reverting to the
                            referendum he said we felt the West had jumped over a hurdle, that a
                            majority of Frenchmen have endorsed De Gaulle's program, that the ultras
                            have been isolated and that the French Army will remain loyal to France.
                            The Algerian situation now warrants modified optimism.” (Substance of

                                is “Algerian Algeria” to be created</hi></p>
                        <p>There is general agreement that the Algerian problem is entering a new
                            phase. There is no longer any question that an “Algerian Algeria” will
                            be created, but there remains the very considerable problem of how this
                            will be done. The central point at issue is to define the Algerian
                            elements to which political power can be transferred without risking
                            unacceptable danger to French national interests. If Algerians could be
                            found who (a) commanded local support and (b) evidenced a willingness to
                            cooperate with France in the post-independence period the forms of
                            transfer of power would assume reduced importance as appears to be the
                            case in the current negotiations with the entente states. Unfortunately
                            Algerian leaders who might have played such a role have either become
                            compromised by non-participation in the rebellion or by siding with the
                            French or, as in the case of Farhat Abbas, have made common cause with
                            the rebellion.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The critical issue—Transfer of
                                Power</hi></p>
                        <p>France seems to recognize that the rebellion will come to an end only
                            through political negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> in its capacity as spokesman for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ALN1">ALN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>
                            (the Military and Political arms of the rebellion). It is probable also
                            that the French Government recognizes that negotiations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> will inevitably lead to that group's
                            assuming the principal role in determining the future policies of
                            “Algerian Algeria”. There is no question that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> and its followers through their
                            advanced degree of political organization, their cadres trained abroad
                            and perhaps covertly in Algeria itself and their security forces, will
                            inevitably outdistance any Algerian competitors. Their initial margin is
                            likely to grow as the formation of trade union, youth and student groups
                            add to <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>'s nationalist image that of
                            primary advocate of internal social and economic reforms which can be
                            expected to have great appeal for the urban masses and landless rural
                            elements. Of course the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> is not a
                            static body and the longer peace is delayed the more likely it is that
                                <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0076"/>its policies will become
                            increasingly revolutionary. On the other hand a relatively quick
                            settlement would maintain the leadership of the new Algeria in
                            comparatively moderate hands.</p>
                        <p>Thus the problem in essence is for France and the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> to reach agreement on (1) transitional steps and (2)
                            Franco-Algerian relations in the post-independence period. We may expect
                            that the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> will wish to make no
                            concessions which would seriously restrict “Algeria's” future freedom of
                            action. At the same time France would be reluctant to make uncompensated
                            concessions in the pre-independence stage, quite apart from the very
                            real problem of France's inability to make any moves at all towards
                            legitimizing the followers of the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>
                            unless the French Army's acquiescence were assured.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it is to be feared that the parties if left to
                            themselves will have great difficulty in reaching a settlement. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> is already showing the strains
                            of a long war in that it is increasingly vulnerable to suggestions from
                            its own militants and to outsiders that continued hostilities will bring
                            about a French political collapse permitting a battle-hardened and truly
                            revolutionary Algerian regime eventually to take over the country. The
                            French Government has had some success in over-riding the objections of
                            the Europeans of Algeria to self-determination and has also been able to
                            maintain army acquiescence in the government's Algerian policies.
                            However, the Army's hatred of the rebels probably continues to inhibit
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> from taking any really decisive steps
                            towards an early transfer of significant powers to the supporters of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> even if he wishes to do so
                            (which is by no means certain). The balance of probability is that talks
                            will be opened, that they will be exploratory in nature and that they
                            will not reach any very meaningful agreements. At the present stage the
                            primary obstacle will probably be the continuation of hostilities. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> will not renounce its principal
                            instrument of pressure on France and undecided Moslems, and <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> will not withdraw the French Army in any
                            appreciable numbers without a prior political understanding between the
                            parties. Should the talks become stalled, we would expect that the next
                            phase of the problem would take place in the resumed General Assembly at
                            which time the Algerians would seek a resolution building on that of
                            December and calling for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to assume
                            a direct role in the negotiations. Such a resolution would put the US
                            directly on the spot. Our failure to endorse such a demand would be held
                            against us for a very long time and should such a resolution fail, the
                            influence of the extremist view regarding the Algerian problems might be
                            impossible to overcome. In this case <persName>De Gaulle</persName>
                            would be caught between pressure in France for a settlement on almost
                            any terms and the French Army with serious consequences for his own
                            authority. The moderate leaders of North and West Africa would also be
                            forced to choose sides instead of working for a reconciliation and would
                                <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"/>bitterly resent what they
                            would hold to be the failure of the US to exert its influence in favor
                            of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> assisted settlement.</p>

                        <p>It is our contention that the foregoing course of events might well be
                            averted by expeditious US action. It is not safe for us to assume that
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> has the problem well in hand but that
                            we could always intervene to “influence” the parties if anything goes
                            wrong. The facts are that De Gaulle's room for maneuver is very limited
                            in the negotiations of such key problems as the future of French
                            military installations in Algeria, the political and economic status of
                            Europeans, the future of French holdings in the Sahara and army
                            toleration of <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> political activity in
                            the pre-independence period. It is also true that self-imposed
                            restrictions in response to French pressures have not only prevented us
                            from established meaningful relations with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> but, together with our sales of armament to aid the
                            French military effort, have given the rebels the impression that for
                            all practical purposes we support the French side politically,
                            militarily and economically. Hence there is every likelihood that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>, faced with a US appeal
                            following no real concessions on the part of De Gaulle, will feel that
                            it has nothing to lose from maintaining a recalcitrant attitude. On the
                            other hand an indication that the US recognizes that an era in history
                            has ended and that in consequence the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> is entitled to be dealt with much as we deal with the
                            future rulers of British territories may cause the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> to see some value in US suggestions.
                            While the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> is disillusioned with past
                            US behavior, it nevertheless still greatly values the potentialities of
                            our active interest and influence in bringing about a solution based on
                            continuing cooperation between the new Algeria and the West. Indeed, the
                            mere evidence of genuine US sympathy and objectivity would go a long way
                            to give the Algerians the confidence to enter into negotiations with
                            France. Already there are indications that the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> moderates will be prepared to discuss fully with the
                            French the key issues mentioned above. It should be our task to ensure
                            that this willingness does not evaporate in the face of the rigid French
                            proposals which are predictable at least in the initial stages of the
                            talks. Not to be overlooked, also, is the added weight which such a US
                            position would give to similar representations to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> by the African and Asian states. The
                            latter have been handicapped by the obvious lack of any supporting
                            evidence for their pleas to the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> to
                            place its trust in Western intentions. We may be thankful that it was
                            only in the sixth year of the war that <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> leaders began to consider seriously the possibility <pb
                                n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>that the West had no real
                            interest in their goals and decided to explore vigorously the
                            possibilities of bloc assistance. We should not conclude however that
                            the turning away from the West is irreversible or on the other hand that
                            it will not continue in the absence of positive Western moves.</p>

                        <p>It may be argued that a US initiative to establish Western bona fides
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> will cause <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> to draw back from his present policies. We do not
                            agree. We think <persName>De Gaulle</persName> has adopted
                            self-determination for French reasons as the only policy which can
                            settle the Algerian problem in a way permitting France to emerge from
                            the settlement with prestige and honor permitting it to assert a valid
                            claim to great power status. His policies are also responsive to the
                            fact of rebellion, to the fact that the rebellion is dominated by the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>, and to the growing demand
                            within France for an end to a most unpopular war. We do not believe he
                            could or would draw back from a settlement on the grounds that the US
                            shared his desire that the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> should
                            negotiate. Nor do we believe that at this stage expanded but discreet US
                            contacts with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> would cause the
                            French Army to do anything which it would not do if faced with the
                            prospect, for example, of numbers of <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>
                            approved Algerians assuming power during the transition period as the
                            result of French contacts with the same persons. If the army will
                            acquiesce in the transfer of power it will hardly revolt against the
                            government of <persName>De Gaulle</persName> because of a US
                            ambassador's contacts in Rabat or Tunis. If it will not acquiesce, such
                            contacts are all the more important to head off the prospects of a
                            bloc-backed Algeria-in-exile forming in Tunisia or Morocco with serious
                            consequences for Western interests in these and other African
                            states.</p>
                        <p>It is also suggested that an approach to the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> will be ineffective unless it is preceded by an
                            approach to De Gaulle. While this may well be true as regards the
                            discussion of specific issues such as the fate of the French naval
                            installations at Mers al Kebir a demarche to <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> is not a prerequisite to the kind of relationship
                            which is in itself also a precondition to advice on specifics. We do not
                            object of course to informing the French that we propose to expand our
                            contacts with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> in the interest of
                            facilitating negotiations and preventing a further deterioration in
                            North Africa's relations with the West. To do so would in fact have the
                            advantage of underscoring to the French the importance we and other
                            friendly states attach to successful negotiations. <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> himself has admitted that world opinion has a
                            justifiable interest in a fair settlement; he could hardly object if we
                            sought to assist by doing what we could to establish and maintain a
                            similar point of view in rebel circles.</p>
                        <p>Finally it is argued that expansion of US contact with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> serves no useful purpose at this time
                            since “we have nothing to say” but should await a moment of difficulty
                            at which we could intervene with a plea for <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51"
                                facs="0079"/>the adoption of a “constructive” approach. This
                            suggestion lacks merit on two counts. It assumes by implication that we
                            will wish to endorse the French position on whatever issue is at stake.
                            It also overlooks the fact that the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>
                            will be responsive to our advice only if we have made it worthwhile for
                            them to do so by having reassured them over some time that we wish to
                            treat with them as responsible political leaders not as guerrillas. We
                            do not have to convey the impression that we consider the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> as the government of Algeria. We do
                            need to make clear that our interest is not to rescue French chestnuts
                            but to deal on dignified terms with those who may be important leaders
                            in a new Algeria.</p>

                        <p>Should the US assume a more positive position towards the Algerian
                            question using expansion of contacts with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> as a first step, it would also be very desirable to
                            make sure that the North African governments understood and appreciated
                            what we were doing. Our willingness to be more forthcoming on Algeria
                            and to consult closely with the North Africans about developments there
                            would do much to shore up our political and military position in Morocco
                            and Libya and would greatly strengthen <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>'s Tunisia. It is quite possible that the
                            favorable reaction we could expect to an indication that the US had
                            finally decided to recognize the trend of events in Algeria would be of
                            assistance to us in gaining greater acceptance for our own positions on
                            other issues. It seems apparent that US “indifference” to Algeria has
                            had a considerable effect on African “indifference” if not antagonism to
                            the US position on cold war issues. This is not to say that differences
                            between the US and the North Africans will not continue, especially as
                            regards bases and certain other matters, but these conflicts can be
                            reduced to manageable proportions once the North Africans are persuaded
                            that the US is in fundamental agreement with them on major political
                            issues.</p>

                            to be decided at this time is that the US is now prepared to approach
                            the Algerian problem from the assumption that it is desirable that an

                            its supporters take place as rapidly as possible, and that the role of
                            the US over the coming months will be to do what it can to ease this

                            neighbors. While we would expect in our discussions with the <gloss

                            towards such matters as the status of European and French economic

                            Algerian overtures for exchanges of views at other than present levels.
                            This should be done unostentatiously and without any advance statement
                            to <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> or others we are prepared do so.
                            In other words we would not envisage sudden campaign to cultivate <gloss

                            and Tunisia's earnest hope U.S. Government would take courageous
                            anti-colonial stand despite difficulties this might cause us with
                            certain of our European allies. Ambassador stressed Algerian problem as
                            Tunisia's main preoccupation and said that present opportunity for
                            negotiations must not be lost. He informed President that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> had been invited visit
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> and that, while <persName

                            was willing to take any step that would help cause of Algerian peace, he
                            first wished to discuss invitation with Algerian friends and to make
                            sure his visit would serve useful purpose and not merely be matter of
                            protocol. In answer to President's question, Ambassador said <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s relationships with <gloss

                            warned that if <persName>De Gaulle</persName> missed present opportunity
                            for negotiations Tunisia could not long hold out against transshipment
                            of Communist help to Algerian fighters.</p>
                        <p>President recalled long interest he had in North African problems from
                            time he was Senator and said his views had not changed though his
                            responsibilities were of course now different. In difficulties that lay
                            ahead we certainly counted on constructive and stabilizing role of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> and Tunisia.
                            It seemed to President that more progress had been made toward solution
                            of Algerian problem in last three months than in last six years. He
                            wondered whether events were not now moving toward kind of solution
                            based on self-determination which he and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> favored. Ambassador expressed
                            doubt events were moving at sufficiently rapid pace. President indicated
                            we looked to Tunisia for any suggestions as to how US could play
                            effective part.</p>

                            at a critical stage which may offer the last real chance of a relatively
                            “peaceful” Algerian solution. It is arguable whether or not we would
                            help or hinder this by US action at this point. But clearly here is an
                            urgent policy issue <hi rend="italic">which ought to be on our

                        <p>DeGaulle is obviously seeking to disengage from Algeria, but if the
                                <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> pushes him too hard he may be
                            unable to do so (a tragedy for him as well as us). Hence it is now up to
                            the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> to meet him halfway, and any
                            influence we may have should be used for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>At a minimum, shouldn't State explore post-haste whether to use all
                            available means of direct and indirect influence to persuade the <gloss

                            the time when the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> leaders must
                            choose between the likelihood of expanded conflict in Algeria, which
                            would inevitably convert it into an East-West issue, and a peaceful
                            transition which in the long run will probably give them all they
                            want.</p>
                        <p>The big hitch is that such efforts might be counter-productive.
                                <persName>DeGaulle</persName> might be upset by our meddling,
                            regardless of whether it were in his interest. As for the <gloss
                                target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>, they might respond to our overtures by
                            seeking compensatory commitments from Washington which would, in turn,
                            embroil us with the French. But before letting the opportunity pass by
                            inaction, let's at least make it a conscious choice.</p>

                                    April 22, French military officers in Algeria seized Algiers and
                                    began an armed revolt against De Gaulle's Algerian policy. The
                                    French Cabinet decreed a state of emergency.</note></item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Ever since the settlers revolt in Algiers in January 1960, the Agency has
                            received, analyzed and published numerous reports of French military and
                            rightist plotting against De Gaulle's government and his Algerian
                            policies. For example, on 26 January the CIB carried reports and
                            analyses of sagging morale and disaffection in the Army and Air Force—in
                            the latter particularly with reference to General Challe's resignation
                            from his <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command in protest over
                            De Gaulle's intention to negotiate with the Algerian rebels. It now
                            appears that the military officers involved, who had initially decided
                            to exclude political leaders from their plans, suddenly moved up their
                            timetable when their plot leaked to the Algiers Delegate General's
                            office last week.</p>
                        <p>In Algeria, insurgent leaders remain in control of most of the territory
                            though it seems clear that large elements of the military there, as in
                            France itself, have not fully declared themselves. There is yet no
                            indication, however, that more loyal or passive elements would challenge
                            the Legion and paratroopers in battle.</p>
                        <p>In France, the government actions on the night of 23-24 April<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d43fn2">On April 23, President <persName>De
                                    Gaulle</persName> announced that he had assumed special
                                emergency powers under Article 16 of the French Constitution, and
                                the French Government undertook intensive emergency preparations to
                                block a possible invasion of metropolitan France by rebel parachute
                                troops.</note> appear to have reduced the prospects of successful
                            invasion of France by the insurgent leaders—if indeed they actually
                            intended such an invasion. These measures also seem to have stirred up
                            the French popular will to resist—particularly among younger groups. The
                            call up of military reservists continues. Other emergency measures are
                            being relaxed, however—tanks and armored cars are being withdrawn from
                            the city, roadblocks and airport barricades removed and commercial
                            flights resumed at Paris airports.</p>
                        <p>De Gaulle is unlikely to give any ground to the demands of the
                            revolutionary military junta. Over the next few days he will probably
                            solicit <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0088"/>acknowledgements of
                            positive loyalty to him both by the general public and by prominent
                            political leaders in an effort to discourage disaffections by now
                            hesitant military officers. The junta leaders for their part will be
                            probing for support in units of metropolitan France and Germany; in the
                            face of strong backing <persName>De Gaulle</persName> is likely to
                            receive, we do not believe they will gain many additional adhesions.</p>
                        <p>If the military leaders in Algeria feel the success of their revolt
                            threatened by isolation and by the blockade imposed by <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> on April 22—which we believe will be
                            effective—they may in the next day or so attempt an invasion of France
                            proper, hoping to spark as yet uncommitted military elements on the
                            continent to their cause. However, as time passes without decisive
                            action in metropolitan France, the insurgent leaders are more likely to
                            turn on the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> rebel bases in Tunisia
                            in a desperate attempt to commit France to an enlargement of the

                                >PAG</gloss>) and the French were broken off, at <gloss

                                    target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> were held at Evian-les-Bains May
                                20-June 13, and at the Chateau of Lugrin July 20-27.</note> The
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> announced that this was not a
                            rupture but a suspension, that they hoped negotiations would be resumed,
                            and that they were leaving contacts in Switzerland to facilitate
                            resumption. They insist that the suspension resulted entirely from the
                            French refusal to concede Algerian sovereignty over the two Saharan
                            departments. They cannot, they maintain, negotiate a settlement on only
                            one fifth of their territory.</p>
                        <p>The French also have expressed a desire the talks be resumed. They have
                            maintained that the Sahara was only a pretext on the part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. They have offered numerous other
                            explanations for the breakoff—inability of the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> to negotiate with the French during the Bizerte crisis,
                            dissension within the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> and loss of
                            influence by the moderates, the technical inability of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> delegation to negotiate, etc.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> meant what they
                            said, and that the question of sovereignty over the Sahara did in fact
                            cause the suspension of the talks. They are simply not prepared to
                            negotiate the future of Algeria <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"
                            />until the Algeria under discussion is defined. The Bizerte crisis did
                            provide an awkward accompaniment to the talks, but the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> nevertheless felt itself able to begin
                            the second series of talks in the midst of the fighting at Bizerte.
                            There are clearly various tendencies within the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss>, and this might affect the bargaining position the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> delegation might take on any
                            given issue, but there is no indication that any group opposing
                            negotiations per se has achieved a position of decisive influence within
                            the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. As for the negotiating ability
                            of the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> delegation, this has not yet
                            been tested, since the negotiations did not progress as far as a
                            discussion of technical details.</p>
                        <p>With the suspension of the talks, what happens now? <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> has made clear his determination to liquidate the
                            Algerian problem by the end of the year. He has conceived of two ways of
                            doing this—by negotiation with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>
                            to arrive at an agreed solution of an independent Algeria associated
                            with France, or by regroupment of the Algerian populations.</p>
                        <p>There is speculation that <persName>De Gaulle</persName> will now proceed
                            with regroupment. This, as <persName>De Gaulle</persName> would seem to
                            envisage, involves bringing all Europeans and those Moslems who wish to
                            remain with France together in enclaves, which have not been delineated
                            but will apparently consist of the areas around Oran and Algiers. The
                            east of Algeria and at least some portions of the center and west would
                            then be abandoned to the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. Once the
                            enclaves were established, <persName>De Gaulle</persName> would propose
                            to organize the emigration, to France, of those who wished, and would
                            then attempt to negotiate some sort of arrangement between the two
                            Algerias.</p>
                        <p>The French have made clear that this solution would be undertaken only as
                            a last resort. They realize that it would not end the war, in that the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> would continue fighting until it
                            obtained all of Algeria. They probably also realize that the French
                            negotiating position in attempting to bring the two resulting Algerias
                            together would almost inevitably be worse than their present negotiating
                            position. Most importantly, to attempt regroupment would be extremely
                            risky for De Gaulle. He has considered himself to be limited in the
                            manner in which he could negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> by the danger of an army-led coup. This danger would
                            increase enormously with an attempt at regroupment, for it is difficult
                            to see how the army would view such an attempt as anything but sheer
                            abandonment.</p>
                        <p>We believe, therefore, that <persName>De Gaulle</persName> will make
                            further attempts to negotiate an agreement. To be successful, this will
                            involve a French concession on Saharan sovereignty (in return for which
                            the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> can be expected to make economic
                            concessions concerning the Sahara, and it is here, rather than with
                            sovereignty, that France's interests are really involved). This
                            concession could best be made by indicating a change in position to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> through the Swiss intermediaries
                            with whom the <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0092"/><gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> is still in contact. This, however,
                            would not correspond to De Gaulle's manner of operation. He would be
                            more apt to make a unilateral concession on the Sahara, possibly as a
                            passing reference in some speech delivered in a provincial town during
                            one of his tours. This procedure has in the past resulted in a number of
                            concessions that went beyond what would otherwise have been necessary,
                            and it has led to a gradual erosion of the French position, but
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> is not apt to change his style of
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>On August 1 Minister for Algerian Affairs Joxe stated in a radio address
                            that, with regard to the Sahara, “in France's view the problem of
                            sovereignty is not the essential thing.” This statement would seem to be
                            a preliminary to a <persName>De Gaulle</persName> concession of Algerian
                            sovereignty.</p>

                        <p>1197. First subject raised in my tour d'horizon with <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> this morning was Algerian situation.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I had followed this situation closely and had discussed
                            it with Joxe Tuesday. I explained that US is aware of France's point of
                            view and sympathetic to her endeavors to deal with this very complex
                            problem and that we are aware of his desire to see Algeria become
                            independent although linked to France.</p>
                        <p>De Gaulle then began familiar exposition of the necessity for France to
                            rid itself of the heavy burden of Algeria. He added that it is no longer
                            important to France whether the future Algeria is friendly toward her,
                            and that France will let Algeria go regardless of the form and attitude
                            of its Government. As in 1958 France had offered independence and the
                            opportunity for continuing ties to her African colonies, she will now
                            offer Algeria the same choice after forming a “national” Government and
                            withdrawing the European population into enclaves such centers as Oran.
                            Should chaos follow, that will be a problem for the Algerians with which
                                <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> will not concern itself.</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"/>
                        <p>I then asked whether he was not concerned about the Sahara in view of
                            French investment and continued interest in its exploitation, since I
                            could not see how a solution to the Sahara issue satisfactory to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOF1">GOF</gloss> could be reconciled with his
                            projected solution to the Algerian problem. <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> replied that nobody had shown interest in the
                            Sahara until the French developed its possibilities. Now he recognizes
                            that it will in the nature of things ultimately be part of Algeria. He
                            realizes, however, that Morocco and Tunisia want part of it—indeed
                            principal motive of Tunisian precipitation of Bizerte crisis was to
                            stake a claim in the Sahara that will later be expanded. Naturally he
                            does not know the final outcome of the Saharan problem. Perhaps the
                            riparian countries will solve it without fighting. As for France she
                            will continue to hold on to the Sahara until the negative value of this
                            position becomes overriding, that is when the cost of maintaining her
                            position there surpasses the return she realizes from being there. There
                            is an abundance of petroleum in the world, so it is not essential that
                            France stay in the Sahara at great cost.</p>
                        <p>I should add early in the discussion I said to <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> that in the past we had been approached by
                            representatives of the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>, that France
                            has always been informed of these contacts, and that they may occur in
                            the future. If this were to happen it might be possible for us to fill a

                            ignored the question, intentionally I believe, and his answer in terms
                            of what was going to happen Algeria was also the answer to what role we
                            might play vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss>. I don't
                            think he cares particularly, perhaps he does not think that what we can
                            do would be significant and, in any event, he is going to go ahead with
                            his own solution.</p>

                            consistently says its objectives obtainable through resumption

                            rather than open negotiations. If agreement with <gloss target="#t_PAG1"

                            fail.</p>
                        <p>We believe time running out rapidly and that French share this view.
                            Failure to reach agreement would result in complete cessation French
                            economic assistance to partitioned section of Algeria and installation

                            conditions. In such case we would undoubtedly see new regime turn to
                            Bloc. In short, we believe resumption negotiations essential. Failure to
                            reach agreement would possibly be disastrous to Western interests in

                            many weeks and that it natural for Asst. Sec. in charge of area to visit
                            countries where he had responsibilities. US had taken no initiative to
                            arrange meeting with <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> members. US
                            had, in fact, resisted attempts by others to give special political
                            significance to <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>' trip to
                            Tunisia insofar as Algerians concerned. Tunisian FonMin had invited

                            invitation. No statements were made to press about luncheon other than
                            to acknowledge it took place. It was press rather than US which created
                            story and attempted give it political significance. Finally, there is no

                                no uncertain terms of their disappointment that the new United

                                statement not exclusively tied to support of De Gaulle.” They had
                                wanted a U.S. statement expressing respect for the “respectability”
                                of the Algerian nationalist cause. <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                    >Williams</persName> argued that such a statement, phrased to

                                interests must be protected, was necessary. (<persName

                        <p>We have asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to consider the value of the

                                constitute a potentially dangerous opening in the southern flank of

                                would threaten east-west lines of communication through the

                                Spain, and other nearby countries. The memorandum was signed by U.S.
                                Army Chief of Staff George R. Decker and included an attachment
                                providing a synopsis of the military facilities in

                        <p>Obviously, the situation under conditions b) and c) above is potentially
                            a serious menace to the Western defense position in the North African,
                            Mediterranean and Middle Eastern areas, particularly if it is the
                            political evaluation that the new Algerian State will not be pro-Western
                            in its orientation. In such a situation, we would want to watch
                            developments most carefully and, in the event of a possible communist
                            take-over, be prepared to take such steps as might be necessary.
                            However, we see no need for the development of contingency plans to cope
                            with this potentially dangerous situation at this time.</p>

                        <p>Can we afford any longer to pursue such a cautious policy on the Algerian
                            question when we may well be heading for a major blowup?</p>
                        <p>DeGaulle appears to be heading toward a showdown with the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, with a final desperate coup attempt
                            possible. The <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> is preparing
                            large-scale Moslem demonstrations in Algeria on 1 November, and European
                            extremists probably hope to provoke fighting. French indignation at
                            Moslem demonstrations in Paris has already made DeGaulle's task even
                            harder. <persName>DeGaulle</persName> himself seems ready in default of
                            a quick negotiated solution to abandon most of Algeria “to chaos”.</p>
                        <p>If negotiations fail, <persName>DeGaulle</persName> seems determined to
                            proceed with a shadow government and then, if the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> won't join in this indirect solution,
                            with regrouping the European population and cutting off aid to the rest.
                            Such partition could lead to a bloodbath, diverting French attention and
                            resources from Berlin, and driving the two sides even farther apart. The
                            U.S. then would face the intolerable choice of flouting
                                <persName>DeGaulle</persName> to help the Algerians or leaving a
                            vacuum for the Communists to fill. In short, the next round of talks
                            between the French and Algerians, expected soon, may be the last chance
                            for a decent settlement.</p>
                        <p>Hence from <hi rend="italic">our viewpoint</hi>, a negotiated settlement
                            and transitional Algerian cooperation with France are essential. But is
                            there anything we can do in this situation where our interests are so
                            vitally at stake? To date, we have played the role of “friendly
                            bystander” largely because we saw no other recourse. There are strong
                            arguments for continuing this role: <persName>DeGaulle</persName> would
                            undoubtedly be offended by any “U.S. interference”, however motivated;
                            powerful segments of French opinion would also be <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>aroused. Nor do we have much leverage
                            with the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> because we can't offer
                            recognition.</p>
                        <p>However, in a situation containing the seeds of disaster, anything we
                            could do, however marginal, is at least worth considering. In the
                            basically new situation created by DeGaulle's desperate search for a
                            settlement, the target of these initiatives must be the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. <persName>DeGaulle</persName> and Joxe
                            have come a long way already, perhaps as far as they can go. But the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> smells victory and shows little
                            inclination to compromise. They do not appear to understand that
                            DeGaulle's fall would ruin chances for a quick settlement. Nor do they
                            appear to understand that <persName>DeGaulle</persName> needs a few
                            basic concessions to sell decolonization in France and to the
                            colons.</p>

                                    and, frankly, make U.S. aid all but impossible. Algeria's

                            <item>Algerian independence is inevitable. We believe (as does De
                                Gaulle) that normalization of relations between France and North
                                Africa possible only if Algerians conduct their own affairs. As far
                                as US concerned, continuation of Algerian war constitutes a major
                                obstacle to conduct effective US policy in North Africa, and also
                                has adverse effects on our relations with France. Perspective of
                                Algerian independence makes it desirable improve relationship with

                                our relationship with new Algerian state, particularly in view of
                                likelihood that independent Algeria will exercise predominant
                                influence in North Africa and on newly independent states bordering
                                on Sahara.</item>

                            <item>Manner in which Algeria will acquire independence not yet clear.
                                If independence comes about without agreement with France, future of
                                Algeria and future relationship between US and Algeria would be
                                heavily mortgaged from outset. There would be danger of chaotic
                                conditions in France and in Algeria which could render France
                                useless as ally and Algeria highly susceptible to Soviet bloc
                                influence. Even if chaotic conditions do not ensue there is further
                                danger that US support for Algeria (or Algerian rump state after
                                pro-French elements have been regrouped in certain enclaves) could
                                alienate France from alliance. Principal objective of US policy must
                                be to prevent such situation from arising. As long as there exists
                                reasonable chance, negotiated agreement between France and future
                                Algerian leadership is therefore of overriding importance. Any
                                proposed inducements to <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> must
                                therefore continuously be examined in light whether they help or

                        <p>The urgent question in our minds is whether we could provide any
                            inducements for <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> reasonableness. We
                            are “intensifying regular contacts,” but do we have anything to offer
                            except advice? Is there any way we can increase the weight of our advice
                            without upsetting the negotiating balance?</p>
                        <p>We feel it's very important to study possible post-independence aid
                            programs now in order (1) to be prepared for quick movement and (2) to
                            discover areas for helpful pre-independence discussion. Admittedly, we
                            can't make final decisions until the situation clarifies, but we can't
                            afford not to move decisively when it does. More immediately, we might
                            find some way of adding substance to our present contacts with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>. If independence emerges from
                            partition, the need for imaginative U.S. action will be even greater
                            than if a settlement is negotiated.</p>
                        <p>We see two related but separate problems: (1) planning our long range
                            approach to independent Algeria and (2) discovering ways to increase our
                            leverage now for insuring successful negotiations. If you set up a study
                            group, perhaps its work might be divided with these distinct problems in
                            mind. Needless to say, we would welcome the chance to sit in on any such
                            deliberations.</p>

                            had the preliminary approval of the Afro-Asian bloc in the United
                            Nations. The draft included an operative paragraph calling on “the two
                            parties to resume negotiations with a view to implementing the right of
                            the Algerian people to self-determination and independence respecting
                            the unity and territorial integrity of Algeria” and a preambular
                            paragraph expressing regret at the suspension of negotiations between
                            the Government of France and the Provisional Government of the Algerian
                            Republic. In a separate telegram, <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> described the draft as “moderate,” and noted
                            that the only significant objection he saw was the reference to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PGAR1">PGAR</gloss>. (Telegrams 2141 and 2142 from

                            Files, 751S.00/12-1461) On December 15, the Department authorized
                            Stevenson to tell the French, Algerian, and Tunisian representatives
                            that the United States could support the resolution if the reference to
                            the <gloss target="#t_PGAR1">PGAR</gloss> and the phrase “and respecting
                            the unity and territorial integrity of Algeria” was eliminated.

                        <p>On December 15, 34 Afro-Asian countries submitted the draft resolution to
                            the First (Political and Security) Committee with the text unchanged
                            except for a reversal in the position of two of its paragraphs. On
                            December 18, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> sent a memorandum to Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> informing him that Chanderli had
                            told <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> he thought the
                            reference to the <gloss target="#t_PGAR1">PGAR</gloss> could be
                            eliminated but not the phrase “and respecting the unity and territorial
                            integrity of Algeria,” to which only the U.S. Delegation had objected.
                            After noting that the French did not want the United States to vote for
                            any resolution on Algeria, <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> argued that “the benefits to be gained from
                            support of the resolution (with reference to <gloss target="#t_PGAR1"
                                >PGAR</gloss> eliminated) will outweigh possible disadvantages in
                            both the short run and long run.” (Ibid., 751S.00/12-1861)</p>
                        <p>That afternoon, the Department cabled to <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> that it was “authorized to make it known publicly (in
                            any way and at any time you deem best) that US prepared to vote for this
                            resolution if those two elements, which would make an already difficult
                            negotiation more difficult, are corrected.” The telegram noted that the
                            reference to the “unity and territorial integrity of Algeria” was a
                            clear attempt to prejudice the outcome of the negotiations on the
                            Sahara. (Telegram 1612 to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>; ibid.,

                        <p>Despite U.S. efforts, the text of the resolution as submitted on December
                            15 remained unchanged. U.S. Representative <persName corresp="#p_YCW1"
                                >Charles W. Yost</persName> explained the U.S. decision to abstain

                            in the French Ambassador to inform him of the decision to receive
                            representatives of the <gloss target="#t_FLN1">FLN</gloss> in the

                            deferred, however. On November 21st the Secretary decided that <gloss

                            now ready to receive Algerian representatives in the Department.
                            According to your memorandum of December 11th to Mr. <persName

                            correspondingly deferred.</p>
                        <p>This matter is of particular importance now because the Paris meetings
                            will be over at the end of this week and the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss> Minister of Information, Yazid, who is now in New York
                            for the Algerian debate, may well want to be received in the Department.
                            He has already asked to be received by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> in New York. I think we
                            should be prepared to receive him here as well, presumably some time
                            early next week.</p>

                            representatives may be received in the Department, it was the decision
                            of the Acting Secretary on September 15, confirmed by the Secretary on
                            October 9, that they could be received up to the level of Under
                            Secretary. I think we should retain flexibility in this matter. As you
                            know, I myself have already met socially with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> Information Minister in Tunis. I am
                            afraid we would defeat our purpose if we tried to downgrade him, for

                                <p>President welcomes conclusion of cease-fire agreement for Algeria
                                    as a great and historic accomplishment. He expresses his sincere
                                    gratification for the wisdom and statesmanship which you and
                                    your colleagues brought to bear in helping to achieve it. He
                                    believes the opportunities it provides for a friendly and
                                    fruitful relationship between Algeria and France should prove to
                                    be of profound benefit to all concerned. He sincerely hopes that
                                    it will assure a future for Algeria toward which all residents
                                    will contribute constructively.</p>
                                <p>President feels that Algeria now stands at the threshold of a
                                    bright new future. He says that we Americans can from our own
                                    heritage appreciate the great tasks and opportunities that lie
                                    ahead for the people of Algeria as they prepare to build a new
                                    nation and in this we wish them well. He wishes to assure you
                                    that we look forward to establishing friendly relations, of
                                    benefit to both of our nations and peoples.</p></item>

                        <p>It has been agreed, as you know, that following the Algerian cease fire,
                            the Department should receive representatives of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> informally <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90"
                                facs="0118"/>at an appropriate high level. The occasion of the
                            official announcement of a cease fire agreement would in itself present
                            an opportunity which I believe would be particularly useful for us to
                            exploit in this connection.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate an early chance to talk to Mr. Chanderli, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> representative in New York, who up to
                            now has been limited in Departmental contacts to occasional informal
                            discussions with officers of <gloss target="#t_AFN1">AFN</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> outside the Department. Mr.
                            Chanderli has been quite forthcoming in these discussions and informal
                            talks he has had with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                >USUN</gloss> officers.</p>
                        <p>On an informal basis I should like to arrange to have a discussion with
                            him as promptly as possible after the cease fire announcement during
                            which I would propose to inform him of the substance of the President's
                            message and the additional points which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_WWNJ1">Walmsley</persName> will have been authorized to
                            pass to Ben Khedda.</p>
                        <p>This would serve two useful purposes. First, it would be very gratifying
                            to Chanderli who has been sensitive about not being informed about past
                            initiatives of the Department concerning the <gloss target="#t_PAG1"
                                >PAG</gloss>. Secondly, it would provide a natural pretext for
                            holding such an interview and changing our policy of banning reception
                            of <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss> representatives in the Department
                            under circumstances and at a time which could hardly be seriously
                            objectionable to the French.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chanderli is a likely choice for the post of first Algerian
                            representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and possibly
                            also Ambassador to the United States. Recent conversations he has had
                            with <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> indicate that he is well
                            informed about Algerian plans concerning inter-African cooperation and
                            that he is destined to play a significant part in Algerian
                            representation at future African conferences such as the Conference of
                            Independent African States scheduled to take place at Tunis later this
                            year. I feel that this move to establish a basis for informal
                            discussions in the Department would help us considerably in obtaining a
                            flow of useful information about prospective internal and external

                        <p>I was called yesterday evening between 8 and 9 p.m. by Pierre Salinger.
                            He said he had been called by Lebel of the French Embassy, on
                            instructions from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9"
                                >Alphand</persName>, who said the Embassy was concerned at the
                            omission from the statement which the White House had issued<note n="1"

                            told Salinger that this had been deliberately done in order not to
                            appear to be giving credit only to one side.</p>
                        <p>Salinger called me back sometime later to say he had talked with the
                            President, who had requested that some way be found to convey to the
                            press our admiration for De Gaulle's role. Salinger asked if it would be
                            all right for him to leak to the correspondents the fact that Ambassador
                            Gavin had been instructed to express to <persName>De Gaulle</persName>
                            the President's feelings of admiration and gratification.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d62fn2">On February 23, the Embassy in Paris had been
                                instructed to call on <persName>De Gaulle</persName> as soon as a
                                cease-fire agreement was officially announced in order to convey an
                                oral message expressing the President's deep awareness of the
                                immense difficulties that <persName>De Gaulle</persName> had
                                overcome to reach the agreement, the painful decisions and
                                sacrifices involved, and his admiration for the great qualities of
                                character and statesmanship that made the agreement possible.
                                (Telegram 4554 to Paris; ibid., 751S.00/2-2362) On March 18, the
                                Ambassador was authorized to carry out these instructions. (Telegram

                                751S.00/3-1062)</note> I pointed out that the Ambassador had not
                            been instructed to see <persName>De Gaulle</persName> personally and
                            that it would therefore be better to confine any background comments to
                            the press to saying that the Ambassador had been instructed to convey to
                            the French Government the appropriate sentiments of the United States
                            Government with regard to De Gaulle's role. Salinger agreed, and said he
                            would do so.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s talk with Couve was just the
                            latest in the series of unsuccessful efforts to win French cooperation
                            in planning post-independence aid for Algeria. <persName

                                target="#t_Secto1">Secto</gloss> 9) that “it would be best not to

                                    corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> reported this conversation in

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 751S.00/6-2062) The
                                conversation was also recorded in a memorandum of conversation.
                                (Ibid., Secretary's Memoranda of Conversation: Lot 65 D

                        <p>So we're caught between this French position and the certainty that the
                            Algerians will want to begin talking aid soon after independence. In
                            fact, Information Minister Yazid has already suggested that we put some
                            statement of willingness to aid Algeria into our Independence Day
                            message.</p>
                        <p>So far, <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>'s position has prevailed in
                            State—we must wait for a French green light (except for relief projects)
                            to avoid offending DeGaulle. On the assumption that substantial planning
                            is impossible without French coordination, <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> has done little. Although they've picked a Mission
                            Director, they still do not have a senior desk officer to back him
                            up.</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0124"/>
                        <p>With independence expected July 5, I don't think we can wait any longer
                            for the French lead. The Soviets certainly won't. After trying for seven
                            months to play ball with Paris, we too simply have to put ourselves in a
                            position to respond to the Algerian requests almost certainly in the
                            offing. Admittedly, it is unlikely that we can launch major development
                            projects until the new government settles down, but numerous
                            rehabilitation and public works projects will be urgent in the near
                            future. If we are prepared to move, for instance, we can combine PL-480
                            food relief with a Title II program to support such labor intensive
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>We have made a pretty decent showing so far with a number of relief
                            projects (about $4-1/2 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '62)
                            and the Algerians have been appreciative. Most have been administered
                            through Red Cross or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> High Commissioner
                            for Refugees—financial support for repatriation, food, 10,000 tents for
                            temporary shelter, etc. State also hopes to get a medical team of six
                            University of Chicago surgeons under <gloss target="#t_CAREMEDICO1"
                                >CARE-MEDICO</gloss> sponsorship with equipment and drugs to Algeria
                            by 1 July. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has approved $100,000 to
                            support the Red Crescent, which the <gloss target="#t_PAG1">PAG</gloss>
                            says it will rely on after independence for relief projects.</p>
                        <p>But the problem now is to free our hand to be responsive to much larger
                            Algerian requests in the crucial post-independence months. This will
                            require a policy decision to act without a French go-ahead (although of
                            course notifying the French). To stimulate State to take this step, we
                            could send them an <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> like the

                                            reached in our persistent efforts to coordinate with the
                                            French our planning for aid to independent Algeria. At
                                            the same time as Couve comments that ‘it would be best
                                            not to discuss aid for many months,' we have indications

                                            soon after independence. While recognizing the
                                            sensitivity of this matter, I am concerned lest our
                                            policy of waiting for the French lead may cost us too
                                            much politically with the Algerians, who will certainly
                                            be asking shortly for help. Would you therefore review
                                            this policy and let the President know how far you think
                                            we can go independently of the French? He would also

                            Algiers by mid-September as an Independence Day gift. State plans a $5.3
                            million refugee resettlement program under the Refuge Act to meet the
                            needs of the next few months until we can launch a formal aid
                            program.</p>
                        <p>But even this relief activity reveals a sharp difference between State
                            and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> approaches. State has generated
                            almost all of it, although <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has
                            cooperated in some of the staffing arrangements and has two of its
                            refugee and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 experts in Algiers.
                            State believes we have to do some aggressive planning even before the
                            Algerians are ready to launch a major development program. Latter don't
                            fully understand the complexities of development economics, and it will
                            be up to us to provide what positive guidance we can. Hutchinson in
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, on the other hand, has taken a
                            go-slow position on grounds that we don't want to get deeply involved in
                            a long range refugee relief effort, we don't want the French to unload
                            Algeria on us, and we can't do any planning at all until the Algerians
                            come to us with requests.</p>
                        <p>We have to clear the air on this basic policy question—should we be
                            aggressively forthcoming or sit back and wait? We may have to wait until
                            Algerian air clears to act, but we can't afford to wait much longer to
                            get <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and State on the same track. And
                            we can't wait much longer for the French lead. The Soviets won't.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bill</hi>: I want to thank you for supplying me
                            with a copy of your memorandum concerning the possibility of providing
                            military assistance to Algeria which you sent to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>.<note n="1" xml:id="d70fn1">
                                Polk's memorandum discussed several potential sources of military
                                equipment for Algeria, noting that the most disadvantageous to the
                                United States would be for the Soviet Bloc to provide military
                                equipment and instruction directly to the Algerians, which would
                                have a profoundly dislocating effect on the U.S. strategic position
                                in Africa. On the other hand, potential damage to French-U.S.
                                relations placed direct provision of U.S. military equipment near
                                the bottom of the scale of desired actions. The best arrangement
                                would be to have France supply such equipment, but current French
                                attitudes made this unlikely. Better from the U.S. point of view
                                would be to have a friendly Muslim country or another European
                                country act as a source of supply. (Ibid.)</note> Advance
                            information of <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>this type is
                            extremely helpful. A review of this subject is both timely and important
                            if we are to take the initiative rather than waiting to react to Soviet
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>If it is decided to form an interagency working group on this or similar
                            African policy problems, it would be useful if <gloss target="#t_ISA1"
                                >ISA</gloss> could be represented. In this particular case, I would
                            designate Colonel Howard C. Junkermann and Colonel Joe Whitfield to
                            represent my office.</p>
                        <p>I have several comments concerning the memorandum which you may find
                            helpful in your deliberations.</p>
                        <p>I question the concept of any alternative which envisions the probable
                            use of an Arab country acting as an agent for the Soviet Bloc to furnish
                            aid to Algeria. Further, the furnishing of U.S. equipment through a
                            friendly power such as Pakistan would be such a thin subterfuge as to be
                            practically worthless. For example, we were accused of being a party
                            with the French in the Algerian rebellion because the French used U.S.
                            manufactured equipment. The idea of incorporating other friendly powers
                            such as Sweden, U.K., Italy, Japan, etc., which have an industrial base
                            capable of supporting either partially or in toto the required armaments
                            for training, has considerable merit. However, in such cases, it would
                            be appropriate for the U.S to be disassociated with the effort. Of
                            course, France is the logical choice to furnish such assistance but she
                            may be unwilling to meet the needs in a forthright fashion.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I believe that the time has come, if we are unsuccessful
                            after exploring the problem with friendly industrial nations, for the
                            U.S. to speak firmly and clearly to the French about the matter,
                            indicating we are prepared to offer Algeria military assistance if they
                            do not. In this case it would be better for the U.S. to act directly
                            than through a third party.</p>

                            any misapprehensions he may have about “neo-colonialist” U.S. policies,

                            him; (2) underline the importance of close cooperation with France.</p>
                        <p>This 46 year old comes with great personal respect for you, dating from
                            your 1957 Senate speech (you could give him a copy of Strategy for
                            Peace). He still clings to a lot of naive ideas and thinks in terms of a
                            melange of revolutionary cliches from Marx, Mao, Nasser and Che Guevara.
                            Basically, however, he's much more pragmatic than doctrinaire.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it should be possible to impress him with our general support
                            of self-determination and social change, our respect for honest
                            non-alignment, and even of our legitimate concern over the Communist
                            threat to new nations (Sekou Toure's experience is relevant here). He
                            understands why we couldn't back his rebellion; indeed your 1957 speech
                            gives you credentials to argue that you didn't oppose it.</p>
                        <p>The best tactic, however, might be to handle him in low key, asking him
                            questions and responding to his sallies. You might want to query him
                            first about his own plans for Algeria. This could lead naturally to an
                            airing of the outlook for the Evian Accords. We emphatically want France
                            to shoulder the main burden in Algeria (the bill will be immense, and we
                            don't have the money—at least this year). But too direct an affirmation
                            of the need for close French-Algerian ties might arouse suspicion.
                            Instead you might ask him what he thinks he can get from the <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0131"/>French, how many technicians and
                            teachers he thinks he can woo back, whether he can get Paris to continue
                            the Constantine Plan, etc.</p>
                        <p>Ben Bella recognizes the need for extensive French help, and that
                            Algeria's natural economic links are with Europe. But as a neutralist
                            he's going to tap other counterbalancing sources, both east and west.
                            While State believes he has no shopping list in his pocket, he
                            undoubtedly wonders how generally forthcoming we're likely to be.</p>
                        <p>We've given a lot of relief help already—350,000 tons of food since 1956
                            through voluntary agencies, a medical team and supplies, ten mobile
                            clinics as an independence gift—and have already approved $40 million
                            more in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 food relief (see Tab

                            feeding and food-for-work projects through the winter. But they are
                            reluctant to volunteer other aid—even in principle—for fear of arousing
                            Algerian hopes of extensive technical assistance or development lending.
                            They claim they can't round up enough French and Arabic speaking
                            technicians for such a program and don't have loan money.</p>
                        <p>State agrees that France must shoulder the chief load, but argues for a
                            U.S. program to support <persName>Ben Bella</persName> indirectly
                            against an army takeover and to influence development planning as it
                            matures. They feel that the Evian Accords might break down, or at least
                            be greatly modified, and that the Bloc will be all too willing to jump
                            in. They would prefer <persName>Ben Bella</persName> to turn to us for
                            help if he looks anywhere but in Europe. As for <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>'s argument about shortage of funds, they argue that a
                            country as important as Algeria should be near the top of the list for
                            what funds we do have.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing how we're strapped, I think State is right. Here we
                            have a chance (albeit a potentially costly one) to buy in on the ground
                            floor in one of the few really important new nations in Africa. Given a
                            $180 million three-year commitment to Tunisia and $40 million yearly to
                            Morocco (plus $12 million <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63), it doesn't make sense for <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> to program only $2 million (plus food)
                            for Algeria in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63. Agreed that we
                            don't want the French to unload Algeria on us. But we need some kind of
                            an independent presence, if only on preclusive grounds. Unless <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> settles down to imaginative planning,
                            we'll be in no position to respond quickly to Algerian needs, to
                            identify those sectors where concentrating <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104"

                            face the contingency of a breakdown in Franco-Algerian cooperation.</p>
                        <p>I don't know whether either you or <persName>Ben Bella</persName> will
                            want to bring up Cuba (he still seems to be going there).<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d71fn3">On October 6, following instructions from
                                Washington, <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> told
                                Khemisti that the U.S. Government was deeply disturbed by press
                                reports that <persName>Ben Bella</persName> planned to visit Cuba
                                immediately after being received by President <persName

                                of State, Central Files, 033.51S11/10-662)</note> But he's now heard
                            from many sources how sensitive we are on this issue. His entourage in
                            New York says he is going to Cuba to satisfy the leftists at home,
                            perhaps with some vague notion of healing the U.S.-Cuban rift. He
                            professes to believe that Castro is a “madman.” He excluded Communists
                            from the National Assembly, and even Colonel Boumedienne recently said
                            that the “Communists never sincerely aided the Algerian rebellion.”</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, many Algerians still seem to look at Castro through
                            rose-colored glasses. So Cuba may provide a good text to get across the
                            risk of Communist capture of indigenous national revolutions (I've
                            attached a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> summary).</p>
                        <p>Finally, you might want to congratulate <persName>Ben Bella</persName> on
                            his formation of a government and dedication to the principles of
                            parliamentary democracy. He's allowed an opposition in the new Assembly;
                            almost a third of it has opposed him on one issue or another. Whether or
                            not <persName>Ben Bella</persName> reverts to one-party government, he's
                            a better bet than the army (Major Slimane, whom you'll see at luncheon
                            is along as the Army's man). Although our ability to influence the
                            outcome of Ben Bella's struggle to retain power is negligible, we lose
                            nothing by encouraging him along his current moderate course.</p>
                        <p>We propose an innocuous joint communique after our talk, in order to
                            limit Ben Bella's opportunities to free-wheel with the press (Draft at

                        <p>President asked <persName>Ben Bella</persName> explain Algerian
                            non-alignment policy. Prime Minister said Algeria did not believe
                            grouping of non-aligned states useful as it would become only another
                            bloc. Algeria deeply committed certain principles however. It against
                            imperialism, colonialism, racial discrimination, nuclear tests,
                            armaments races and spheres of influence. Algerians attributed own
                            suffering during war to attitudes represented by such actions and
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>President said there seemed be impression in Algeria that world divided
                            into two blocs and that one led by US favored nuclear tests,
                            colonialism, and imperialism. Since <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>

                            would be useful talk about US policy. US had pursued neutralist and
                            isolationist policy which geography permitted for greater part our
                            history. Since 1945, against their nature, American people compelled
                            become actively interested world affairs in response threat
                            international communism. US wanted world of independent nations each
                            with govt corresponding needs its own people. Communists wanted
                            uniformity tied together and directed by Moscow and Peking. This was
                            danger which forced US assume burden of world defense.</p>
                        <p>Re US policy in Western Hemisphere, President cited examples of Dominican
                            Republic, Venezuela, and Colombia. All were under liberal leadership and
                            had fought for freedom and progress against regressive factions as well
                            as against communists. All were under attack by Castro regime. If these
                            free liberal govts failed, cause of independence and sovereignty of
                            nations might be defeated in Latin America. US could not accept this.
                            Fact that limited minority in Cuba striving bring it about explains US
                            policy towards Cuba. Problems of illiteracy, poverty, and disease as
                            serious in <gloss target="#t_LA1">LA</gloss> as problems of Algeria.
                            Solution must be found within independence.</p>

                        <p>As further evidence US opposition to colonialism Pres cited US dispute
                            with Portugal over self-determination for Angola, and US stand for Congo
                            unity, despite difficulties this entailed with friends in Europe. World
                            struggle not between two great power blocs but between those who wish
                            stable world of independent nations and those seeking establish
                            universal empire.</p>
                        <p>Pres explained that many in US supported Castro at outset because they
                            believed he led national revolution. US Govt cut out military aid to
                            Batista. But Castro betrayed Cuban revolution. Cuban people never had
                            chance express their will but were delivered to communists and appended
                            to Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Ben Bella said experience of Algeria had to be that of radical and
                            general revolution. International communism, however, was not valid for
                            Algeria. Algerians wanted prevent possible danger of communist takeover.
                            Algeria's ideology and religion contrary to it. It against Marxism and
                            communism but for reduction of international tensions. In going to Cuba,
                                <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> said he not wish poison already
                            grave situation, but hoped through positive approach help relax tension.
                                <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> said he did not differ with Pres
                            on substance of problems but had some reservations re choice of policy
                            or lines of conduct. He thought there must be adequate measures other
                            than attempting destroy Cuban regime.</p>
                        <p>Pres replied Cuba had become world problem only since July when Soviets
                            started shipping in arms. Eighty five shiploads of arms delivered since
                            then, and missile bases established. US had no intention of invading
                            Cuba. If it wanted, would have done so years ago. Our concern was over
                            military reinforcements which Soviets have accumulated in Cuba for
                            purpose of harassment.</p>
                        <p>Ben Bella compared Egyptian experience. Egyptian move to accept Czech
                            arms had been serious mistake. However he felt Nasser forced little by
                            little into intolerable situation in part by unwise moves of US
                            Administration then in power. Now Cuban Govt had taken measures which
                            bad, but it best avoid nailing Castro to communist camp by failing give
                            him any other choice.</p>
                        <p>Pres said Dorticos had not extended very green olive branch in <gloss

                            but said fact that Dorticos asking for official promise of non-invasion

                            no hostile intention.</p>
                        <p>Pres said if US did not favor invasion of Cuba, it not because of Soviet
                            military build-up. Real reason was we did not want another Budapest.
                            Sole danger was introduction of Soviet missiles. If those missiles
                            included at any time types capable of striking at US territory,
                            situation would change to such extent that US would be forced reconsider
                            its position. The stronger the military build-up, the more the danger.
                            Cuba's best <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0135"/>protection was its
                            own people's support. US does not want war against small country.</p>
                        <p>In talks with Secretary <persName>Ben Bella</persName> said Algeria had
                            paid high price for entry on international scene and was determined to
                            be constructive. It might make mistakes because it was young and many
                            issues new to it. Because of their practice in international affairs, US

                                Bella's visit to Washington, the Algerians had taken the occasion to
                                outline economic problems and had stressed the urgency of such
                                problems as relief, housing, jobs, and land for peasants, but that
                                it had been evident that they were not ready yet to go beyond
                                discussion of economic problems and a general exploration of ways
                                the United States could help. The telegram noted that, despite press
                                reports to the contrary, no U.S. commitments had been made nor
                                figures discussed. (Ibid., 611.51S/10-1662)</note></p>

                            <item>Seven years of rebellion and terror have left the Algerians weary,
                                uncertain, and divided. Moreover, the established bases of the
                                society and the economy have been altered; two-thirds of the
                                Europeans have <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>left the
                                country, and 50 percent or more of the labor force is jobless. To a
                                great extent the modern sector of the economy is in a state of
                                collapse. Many enterprises have been abandoned by their owners, and
                                the arteries of commerce and communication have broken down at many
                                critical points. (Paras. 1, 4, 18-19)</item>

                            <item>The current period is one of relative political calm.
                                    <persName>Ben Bella</persName> has seized control, and for the
                                moment at least has the support of the largest and best disciplined
                                military force in the country. He is trying, during the present
                                respite in political activities, to consolidate his political
                                position, to improve his popular image, to impose his authority over
                                the Armed Forces, and to revive the economy. (Paras 8-9,

                            <item>Ben Bella, who calls himself both an “Arab Socialist” and a
                                Marxist, appears at the present time to be much closer to Nasser in
                                policy and doctrine than to the Communists. This judgment, however,
                                is based upon his words and actions to date on both national and
                                international matters; there is as yet not enough hard evidence on
                                the new regime to permit us to assess with any degree of finality
                                Ben Bella's basic philosophic leanings; he may indeed prove to be
                                far more radical than he now appears. At the present time
                                    <persName>Ben Bella</persName> does not appear to be vindictive
                                toward France, and he does not now plan major economic changes
                                likely to affront major French interests. The Ben Kheddists, who
                                oppose him, and Colonel Boumedienne, who now supports him, appear to
                                be more radical than Ben Bella. (Paras. 9, 12-13)</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>Little has yet been accomplished in economic revival, and the
                                chances are poor that much will be accomplished in the next few
                                months. Thus, the population in the cities, now dependent upon
                                foreign charity, may become increasingly frustrated, and living
                                standards in the rural areas, already barely sufficient to sustain
                                life, may be further driven down. (Paras. 18-23)</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>While Ben Bella's immediate prospects for holding power are fairly
                                good, we believe that within a year he will be confronted with
                                severe political challenges. The intractible nature of Algeria's
                                economic problems, the somewhat chaotic conditions which will
                                persist, and latent hostility to his rule in important sectors of
                                the society, all will tend to undermine Ben Bella's position. Any
                                one of a number of oppositionist leaders might seek to exploit the
                                dissatisfactions of the jobless, and there is always danger of
                                unrest in the countryside. <persName>Ben Bella</persName> must also
                                somehow establish his authority over the radical Defense Minister,
                                Colonel Boumedienne, and a showdown between the two seems likley to
                                occur sooner or later. If Boumedienne became tired of political
                                infighting, if there were growing insecurity in the cities and
                                subversion in the countryside, or if there were irresolution and
                                confusion in the government, Boumedienne might simply step in and
                                establish a military dictatorship. (Paras. 24-28)</item>

                            <item>We do not believe Algeria's announced policy of nonalignment will
                                be followed with purity and consistency. Already the Algerians have
                                sided with Cuba against the US. But at the same time they are bound
                                to France by a host of cultural and economic ties. The present
                                leaders will probably not deliberately move toward the Soviet Bloc,
                                but they probably will, more often than the US or France would like,
                                support Communist initiatives on a variey of international issues.
                                They will almost certainly accept military and economic assistance
                                from the Bloc. Indeed, we cannot rule out the possibility that
                                    <persName>Ben Bella</persName> himself may adopt a more radical
                                international stance in response to internal pressues or external
                                blandishments. If a more radical leader—such as
                                Boumedienne—succeeded Ben Bella, Communist influence and ideology in
                                both domestic and foreign policy would probably significantly
                                increase. (Paras 29, 31, 34-36)</item>

                                The Algerian independence celebration was held October 31-November
                                1. A note dated November 17 to <persName corresp="#p_MGGC2"
                                    >McGhee</persName> from a member of his staff indicated that
                                    <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss> wanted to remind the Under
                                Secretary of the interest the White House had exhibited in
                                downplaying U.S. representation in Algeria and noted that the choice
                                of Ambassador Achilles as the head of the delegation to the Algerian
                                Independence Day ceremonies had reflected the President's annoyance
                                with Ben Bella's statements about Cuba. The note was attached to a
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> to
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, which
                                discussed the possibility of a visit by <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"

                        <p>Ambassador Achilles notes that the political and economic situation in
                            Algeria is bad and will likely deteriorate. He recommends, among other
                            things, that we should show patience and understanding of Algerian
                            aberrations, e.g. Cuba, and not stop our current relief efforts. He
                            further states that the U.S. should encourage France and Algeria to come
                            together since French capital and skills offer the only hope for
                            economic salvation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kraft, on the other hand, remarks that the important political fact
                            in Algeria is the existence of an opposition which because of its
                            maturity and experience would likely adopt more reasonable foreign and
                            domestic programs, if it came to power. Kraft characterizes the
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> regime as being made up of persons
                            who either spent most of the war in prison or were largely symbolic
                            figure heads. They are following chauvinistic policies and playing East
                            against West. Like Achilles, Kraft sees a key role for France and
                            recommends that if France decides to continue support of Ben Bella, we
                            should undertake modest food for work programs on a
                            government-to-government basis. However, if France discontinues its aid,
                            we should follow suit for we cannot alone avert the crisis and we may be
                            weakening the opposition.</p>

                            review of Algerian situation with <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> indicates that while generally unstable political
                            and economic conditions likely persist for some time, bright spots are
                            appearing, particularly in the political orientation of the government.
                            This probably means that while Algerians likely to remain attached to
                            socialist concepts it does seem that they are now deciding that these
                            ideas must be adjusted to the realities of their economic position. They
                            have learned that the world is not what they thought it to be during
                            years of imprisonment and isolation from Western thought and
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>At moment, Algerian Government seems be engaged in serious effort define

                                >Telegram 2387 from Paris, December 6, reported that the Algerians
                                had asked France for 360 billion old francs in aid but had been
                                assured of only a fraction of that amount, probably 60 billion old
                                francs to carry them to the end of the year. The implication had
                                been that further funds would be forthcoming after the French saw
                                how the new Algerian Government carried out certain commitments with
                                respect to French properties in Algeria, especially those of the 600
                                French farmers still on their land. (Ibid., 651.51S/12-662)</note>
                            Recognizing that such course undoubtedly unpopular with highly vocal
                            groups such as communists, they are taking action against such groups to
                            minimize criticism and consolidate government position internally. This
                            undoubtedly hampers bloc efforts to take advantage of current confusion
                            to plant apparatus in country.</p>
                        <p>Algerian Government attitude toward United States immediately after
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> visit Cuba was mixture of resentment
                            and bewilderment. This was followed by appreciation of fact that
                            population as whole was very disinterested in Cuba and Castro, and
                            unable comprehend government interest in that situation with so many
                            problems at home. Fact that first question addressed to government in
                            foreign affairs debate indicated concern at possible damage to
                            American-Algerian relations had its own special import, and evoked
                            further conciliatory declarations from government and <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> himself. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> believes this trend will continue for time being
                            at least, and longer it does more difficult it will be to reverse.
                            Certainly, Algerians will be extremely careful about getting caught in
                            gears of international politics again.</p>
                        <p>In general, I would say that US posture appears well adapted to present
                            situation. We should continue our food shipments to assist Algerians get
                            through hard winter ahead, support for medical program and further
                            student grants. As picture of French-Algerian relations becomes clear,
                            we can examine sympathetically how best to develop supplementary role
                            which will probably be required. We are not past all shoals in Algeria
                            by any means as Algerian-French relationships mentioned are now in
                            process evolution. If reasonable success crowns current efforts in
                            latter sense, we can assume Algerian sentiment, which at its best is
                            strongly nationalist, will prove to be substantial barrier to communist
                            designs. With regard to effect of Algerians on Africa we may expect that
                            they will be so preoccupied with their own problems for foreseeable
                            future that their influence and effort, beneficial or otherwise, will be
                            rather limited. I am assured Embassy Algiers will remain alert to any
                            need to adapt our posture and programs to new developments in this still
                            highly fluid situation.</p>

                        <p>In view of the Algerian Government's renewed interest in discussing US
                            aid, the President hopes that we are mapping our next steps in this
                            important country. He recognizes that we may want to let the Algerians
                            come to us, and that we clearly want the French to carry the major aid
                            responsibility, with us in a supplementary role.</p>
                        <p>Unless we do some forward planning now, however, we may not be in a
                            position to respond with sufficient dispatch to serve our political
                            interests. We also want to maintain the momentum of our successful
                            emergency program, and to do what we reasonably can to encourage a good
                            Algerian relationship with the West.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the President requests that the Department of State, in
                            cooperation with other interested agencies, draw up a tentative strategy
                            and plan of action for the period of transition from our present
                            emergency relief program toward what we hope will be primary Algerian
                            focus on sensible development. It should include further steps to insure
                            that our program complements French aid wherever possible, together with
                            a review of what diplomatic, civic action, information, Peace

                        <p>Our emergency food program now totals about $65 million and will hit $80
                            million by April. About 35% of the population depend completely on it
                            over the winter, but we will cut back sharply when the spring harvest
                            matures. More will go into food-for-work projects. One reforestation job
                            is supplying intermittent employment for 15,000 workers for 20 months,
                            plus food for their families; <persName>Ben Bella</persName> wants ten
                            more such projects.<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> will support
                            through June a $550,000 CARE-Medico staffing of a hospital near Algiers.
                            We've also sent surplus tents and 10 mobile health units ($181,000),
                            contributed $100,000 to the Algerian Red Crescent, begun US training for
                            several administrators, and brought 53 students to US universities.</p>
                        <p>The Algerians are now acting more soberly as they face up to recovery
                            problems. <persName>Ben Bella</persName> is trying to get on a better
                            footing with the French, seeking loans from Arab oil producers, and
                            asking us to begin aid talks. While all agree that we must leave the
                            major aid burden in Paris, specific US proposals may spur the French to
                            move faster. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> also feels
                            that a few specific offers will forestall wild requests. So we're
                            considering four pilot rural rehabilitation projects to employ 60,000
                            workers (supplying the subsistence for an added 300,000 dependents) at a
                            cost of about $15 million, $11 millon of it in food.</p>
                        <p>We're also looking cautiously at some military aid, largely to give us
                            leverage with the army. Although the French consider this their
                            province, Algeria is reportedly sensitive about seeking substantial
                            military help in Paris. Ben Bella's made some noises about civic action
                            to put demobilized soldiers to work.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>Ben Bella is looking to Nasser for military training, as well as economic
                            help. As for Bloc aid, it has been limited to a few spot gifts and some
                            Bulgarian doctors. So far, <persName>Ben Bella</persName> seems to have
                            convinced his colleagues to look west. We will have a tentative action
                            program shortly.</p>

                            <item>The development of a specific military assistance program,
                                supporting reference 1 b above, is contingent upon French intentions
                                in Algeria with respect to continued economic assistance, French

                                upon Algerian desires and needs for a US program. Any US military
                                assistance program for Algeria must be designed so as to satisfy not
                                only the Algerian Government but, at the same time, not impair our
                                relations with France.</item>

                            <item>Concurrently, any US military aid program for Algeria must be
                                examined for its effect on our relations with Tunisia, Libya, and
                                Morocco. <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>In the latter two
                                countries, the continued use of our military bases remains
                                important. Libya, Tunisia, and, in particular, Morocco would view a
                                significant rise in Algeria's military capabilities as a threat to
                                their border claims in the Sahara as well as an effort on the part
                                of Algerian leaders to gain a dominant role in the North African
                                area. Any actions by the United States to strengthen the offensive
                                power of the Algerian armed forces with prestige items such as tanks
                                and jet aircraft would adversely affect relations with these
                                countries and thus indirectly jeopardize our bases. While a US
                                military assistance program for Algeria could serve to lessen Bloc
                                influence to some extent, it can be expected that the Algerian
                                Government will seek military assistance from the Bloc, and the Bloc
                                will be responsive to these requests.</item>

                            <item>Even though the lack of information and the political realities in
                                North Africa are limiting factors in the development of Algerian
                                programs, the US military may still be able to play an important
                                role in assisting Algeria in reconstruction and economic
                                development. This can be done by developing and organizing the Armed
                                Forces primarily along the lines of an internal security force as
                                opposed to a force whose offensive strength could serve as a threat
                                to Algeria's neighbors. The present Armed Forces of Algeria (about
                                100,000) are beyond the needs of Algeria and aggravate the situation
                                by imposing a financial burden. The present Government has indicated
                                that it plans an Armed Force of 25,000-35,000; however, precise
                                information regarding the make-up of this force is not known. One of
                                the principal problems facing the Algerian Government is to find a
                                way to reduce the size of the armed forces without losing their
                                support. A program to ensure jobs for the released military
                                personnel would serve to lessen the impact on the already staggering
                                unemployment problem. Properly employed, the Algerian Armed Forces
                                could become an effective, constructive force to assist in
                                rebuilding Algeria, in developing the Algerian economy, and in
                                providing an important stabilizing influence.</item>

                        <p>Pursuant to National Security Action Memorandum No. 211 of December 14,
                            1962, the Department of State has coordinated the efforts of the
                            recipients of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 211, as well as
                            several other agencies having interest in programs for Algeria, and now
                            submits a Plan of Action for Algeria. Our Ambassador to Algeria,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">William J. Porter</persName>, also
                            participated in the final deliberations. The Action Plan has been
                            concurred in by all of the participating agencies.</p>
                        <p>Actions projected for the next seventeen months are predicated on the
                            assumption that France and Algeria will by and large be successful in
                            working out their new relationship as independent nations, and that
                            France will continue to carry the major aid responsibility. U.S.
                            strategy is to continue to encourage this trend through advance
                            coordination with the French of planned U.S. actions in Algeria and
                            encouragement of the Algerian Government to take a moderate course in
                            balancing nationalist goals against the immediate necessity of
                            constructive Franco-Algerian cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Basic U.S. objectives are: (1) to prevent significant communist bloc
                            influence, (2) to promote U.S. influence, and Free World influence
                            consonant with U.S. interests, and (3) to contribute to Algerian
                            political stability, economic recovery, and progress toward sound
                            development.</p>
                        <p>In order more effectively to pursue these objectives and to maintain and
                            improve the reasonably good U.S.-Algerian relationship that has
                            developed over the past year, it is recommended that the United States
                            take the following actions in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 and
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64: <list>
                                <item>First, proceed with diplomatic efforts, which have already
                                    made considerable headway, to explain our foreign policies to
                                    the Algerian Government and to extend and strengthen contacts
                                    with influential elements in and out of Government;</item>
                                <item>Second, continue the emergency feeding program until the
                                    Algerian summer harvest and phase it out as soon as possible

                                <item>Fourth, explore with the Algerian Government other means of

                                <item>Fifth, continue <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> support

                                    this program to one supported by private U.S. resources without

                                <item>Sixth, explore various possibilities for an <gloss

                                <item>Seventh, provide selected Algerians with training in the

                                <item>Tenth, take appropriate action to promote U.S. private

                                <item>Thirteenth, promote U.S.-Algerian trade and general relations

                                    the contingencies of (1) a <gloss target="#t_GOA1">GOA</gloss>

                            request for Peace Corps assistance. It is felt that a Peace Corps
                            contribution to Algeria in the near future would be very valuable.</p>

                            Algerian stability, or serious disagreement between Algeria and France
                            leading to sharp reduction or retardation of French aid. In any event,
                            constant re-assessment of the adequacy of U.S. actions projected in this
                            plan will be required because of the transitional and quickly changing
                            stage which Algeria will be going through in the period which this
                            Action Plan embraces.</p>

                            discuss it with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            when he sees you 12:15 Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Things seem to be breaking our way in Algeria. <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> has settled down, patched up his relations with the
                            French and begun focusing on his acute domestic problems. He's been
                            pressing us for more aid, and I think your intervention has produced a
                            reasonably good response.</p>
                        <p>This year we'll (1) launch four pilot rural rehabilitation projects; (2)
                            expand the food-for-work reforestation program; (3) mount an
                            immunization and public health training effort; (4) continue college
                            scholarships, participant training and CARE-Medico teams; and (5) go
                            ahead until the mid-summer harvest with the sizable emergency feeding
                            program begun last summer. Cost will be about $2 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 for equipment and technicians, plus at
                            least $80 million in food.</p>
                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 we'll continue with perhaps $75
                            million in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 and up to $15 million
                            in <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> and TA funds. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> bought <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                                >Bell</persName>'s recommendation that France should handle anything
                            above that level; <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> is also
                            concerned about shortage of funds.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that we may end up wanting to go higher than $15 million for
                            political reasons. While the French apparently do intend to carry
                            Algeria (for at least $200 million annually), we want enough of a
                            presence to reflect the fact that Algeria is the key to the Maghreb and
                            one of the top new nations in Africa. Moreover, <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> et al have already asked about several projects
                            worth $10-15 million each that tie into our emphasis on rural
                            rehabilitation. But we needn't decide this issue yet.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Peace Corps</hi> hesitations create another issue.
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> specifically asked <persName

                                >PC</gloss> help, and State thinks such a program “very valuable.”
                            But the <gloss target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss> is overextended in Africa, and
                            is sensitive on the general question of relating Peace Corps to other

                        <p>I suggest you put out attached <gloss target="#t_NSAM1"

                            seems desirable and gives the Peace Corps a gentle nudge.</p>

                        <p>All concerned should bear in mind the need for a program commensurate
                            with our policy interests in this key North African country. While we
                            want France to shoulder the lion's share of the burden, we also want to
                            increase our own influence. For example, I should like to be advised if
                            it should appear highly desirable to exceed somewhat the $15 million

                        <p>Reasons behind Cuba/Algeria tie are baffling, but we think <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> sees it as a sop to extremists who oppose continued
                            close association with France. Recent financial deal with France, while
                            quite successful economically, was not politically spectacular.
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> hasn't pressed Paris further on
                            Saharan nuclear testing. His economic difficulties may have made him
                            more cautious about nationalization. So he may feel playing up to
                            foreign revolutionaries in Cuba and Angola is one of his few appeals to
                            his own left.</p>
                        <p>In any case, we have no realistic alternative but to live with
                            Cuba/Algeria affair till it peters out, meanwhile helping this along by
                            educating Algerians on how little they gain and how much it might cost.
                            We've been doing so every chance we have, pressing the line both here
                            and in Algiers that things like Guevara visit don't help Algeria win
                            friends in our Congress and public. Salinger and I both chided new
                            Algerian Ambassador on Guevara visit.</p>
                        <p>Guellal says <persName>Ben Bella</persName> recognizes that Cuba has
                            become a Soviet satellite, but that he hopes to move Castro away from
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. <persName>Ben

                            relations; we'll have to keep working on him that it is. I'm confident
                            that over time Algerians will increasingly realize Cuban tie is
                            worthless, if we can just sit it out till then.</p>

                                sent a briefing memorandum to the President suggesting that he take
                                the time for some serious talk with the new Algerian Ambassador, who
                                was one of Ben Bella's closest confidants. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> proposed that the President
                                focus on the need for Algeria to put its economy, which was in near
                                chaos, in order before anyone else could do much to help, and on
                                U.S. problems with Castro and how Algeria's relations with Cuba
                                raised difficulties for nations that wanted to help Algeria.

                        <p>The First Algerian Ambassador to the United States, Cherif Guellal,
                            presented his credentials to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> during the course of a thirty minute
                            interview.</p>
                        <p>After recalling meeting Ambassador Guellal at the time of Prime Minister
                            Ben Bella's visit last year, the President expressed his sympathy for
                            the death of Foreign Minister Khemisti and enquired whether the motive
                            for his assassination had been established. Ambassador Guellal replied
                            that the motive was unclear, but probably personal, the act of a
                            deranged mind.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador mentioned the devastation which Algeria had suffered in
                            eight years of war, and the enormous problems created by the lack of
                            trained personnel. In response to the President's question, he said that
                            the Algerian Government sought to encourage the French to stay on to
                            help, especially in the fields of education, administration, finance and
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> expressed his
                            concern at the dislocation caused by the departure of these skilled
                            personnel. He said we were very interested in Algeria's success in
                            managing her economic problems. We had assisted through food. He hoped
                            that the situation could now be stabilized, the French encouraged to
                            return, and some private capital brought <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                facs="0153"/>in to get the economy working. If the economy were
                            restored to a vigorous phase, other problems would be less
                            important.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Guellal agreed that Algeria's problems were basically economic. The
                            President said he thought it was important to provide a stimulus for
                            French assistance. The Ambassador insisted that Algeria encouraged
                            foreign investments, and especially hoped to enlist the interest of
                            American companies. After enquiring about the Algerian investment code,
                            the President remarked that while we were not seeking to place American
                            capital investments abroad because of our balance of payments problem,
                            it was very important for us that Algeria succeed, and we would do what
                            we could to help. The French, he thought, had the primary obligation.
                            But we were concerned for Algeria's economy—if that broke down,
                            everything dissolved.</p>
                        <p>The President then referred to the recent Independence ceremonies at
                            Algiers, and observed that Senator Mansfield had been impressed with the
                            welcome given to the Cuban delegate, Che Guevara. He recalled that he
                            had discussed Cuba with <persName>Ben Bella</persName> and understood
                            the Algerian feeling that Cuba had supported Algeria during the months
                            and years of the war. However, Algeria should understand sour American
                            feelings at the extent of the welcome to Guevara, beyond that accorded
                            anybody else.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Guellal replied that he understood American feelings. It was
                            very difficult, he said, to explain the overall situation, a very
                            emotional adjustment. But the Algerian Government was gaining a greater
                            realization of the situation in Cuba now that it had a Charge there.</p>
                        <p>The President said he appreciated Algerian identification with the
                            successful Cuban guerrilla activities, but remarked that the action
                            against Batista was not a serious war, with perhaps 100 killed. It was a
                            political effort, while the Algerian was a bloody affair. Cuba was a
                            pretty hard boiled Communist state, in a satellite relationship to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, being used to communize Latin
                            America.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Guellal responded that they had stressed these points with the
                            Cubans, they realized the Cubans were completely aligned, and suggested
                            that their own relationship with France might serve as a possible
                            formula for US-Cuban relations. He repeated that his Government knew how
                            far Cuba was aligned with the Soviets, and now understood better the
                            issues for the United States. As for US-Algerian relations, Mr. Guellal
                            assured the President that there could be no doubt of Algeria's
                            friendship. Algeria needed America's help in restoring her economy and
                            greatly appreciated the food which had been sent.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the formal letters were exchanged. The President remarked
                            on reading the Algerian message that he greatly appreciated the
                            reference to his Senate speech. He asked the Ambassador to present his
                            best regards to President Ben Bella.</p>
                        <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Guellal conveyed in return his President's personal regards to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. He added that
                            if <persName>Ben Bella</persName> should come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in September, he hoped there might be an
                            opportunity to call on the President. The President replied that he
                            would look forward to seeing President <persName>Ben Bella</persName> if
                            he came. Ambassador Guellal hastened to add that of course <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> would not go to Cuba this time.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Mr. Guellal observed that Algeria had passed through a year
                            of difficulties but was now on the way to recovery. The President
                            expressed his pleasure at having an Algerian Ambassador in
                            Washington.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The President asked about the significance of Ben Bella's cabinet
                            reshuffle. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said it
                            appeared that the Algerian President is gathering around him people whom
                            he considers to be completely loyal to him personally.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired concerning Ben Bella's personal
                            philosophy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> considers himself to be a foremost
                            African revolutionary figure, and that much of what he says in public is
                            said with that in mind. He added that Mr. <persName>Ben Bella</persName>
                            is a zealot who makes every move with great vigor. His take-over of
                            12,000 French farms last spring without giving much thought as to
                            whether markets in France <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0155"/>could
                            be preserved or what kind of administrative system would replace the
                            French farmers, was a case in point. Mr. <persName>Ben Bella</persName>
                            feels convinced of the need to do such things swiftly rather than
                            negotiate about them. He states that swift action is necessary in the
                            interest of his people. The Ambassador expressed the belief that there
                            would be more drastic moves of an economic nature, and the principal
                            question now is whether the French will find the fortitude to live with
                            the difficulties <persName>Ben Bella</persName> will create for them in
                            this and other fields.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired concerning current French aid to Algeria and
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> outlined the
                            importance of the French to <persName>Ben Bella</persName> both in terms
                            of aid and trade as well. Governor <hi rend="italic">Williams</hi> asked
                            the Ambassador to comment on the significance of the recent Russian
                            credit of $100 million. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> said that the details of this credit have
                            apparently not yet been negotiated, adding that the figure seemed to
                            have been published, as in previous cases, for its propaganda impact. In
                            any case Mr <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said, if the
                            total sum were available to the Algerian Government today it would
                            hardly meet the Algerian administrative budget deficit over a period of
                            four months.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired concerning Ambassador Guellal; whether he
                            enjoys a close relation with Ben Bella. Governor <persName

                            is the case. The President asked Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"

                            from talking to Ambassador Guellal that the latter is worried about acts
                            and attitudes of his government, and that when Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> expressed the fact that reports
                            indicate Castro may be in Algiers about November 1, Ambassador Guellal
                            did not deny this.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should do what we can to prevent Castro from
                            visiting other countries and he inquired what could be done to hamper
                            such a visit. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            said if French and Arab (especially Egyptian) cooperation could be
                            obtained that something could be done to diminish the propaganda impact
                            of such a visit. The President inquired whether cutting off aid should
                            be considered in this connection. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2"

                            desired results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> recalled that the
                            President had indicated a willingness to see <persName>Ben

                            President said that he does not think this would be a good idea if a
                            week later Castro showed up in Algiers. Something might be arranged if
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> came to the United States some time

                                that the prospect of another encounter between <persName>Ben

                            a result of Boumedienne's recent Moscow visit. 450 Algerians are getting
                            military training in the Bloc. Chicoms have entered the competition with
                            $50 million credit at no interest.</p>

                            reacted violently; they even protested that campaign seemed inspired.
                            Then US press overplaying of Kabylia “revolt” led to expulsion of
                            several newsmen. This will give <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> an

                            But we and French both think <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> is in the
                            saddle for quite a while. So holding off in hopes of some new faces
                            leaves me cold.<note n="1" xml:id="d87fn1">A handwritten note in the

                            RWK.”</note></p>
                        <p>Another complication is that the French, who have been carrying the chief
                            aid burden in Algeria ($200 million this year), might draw back if
                                <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss> reacts violently to their next
                            A-test or puts squeeze on their oil. If so, <gloss target="#t_BB1"
                                >BB</gloss> will no doubt lean even further east.</p>
                        <p>Thus I see a potentially quite adverse trend in our Algerian affairs,
                            especially painful since we gained quite some capital by our responsive
                            attitude during formative stages of <persName>Ben Bella</persName>
                            regime. I have no panaceas to suggest; I question whether we could or
                            should enter a major competition with the East. But I don't see our
                            present effort as enough either, however. We gave $77 million in food
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'63 and are planning about the same
                            this year (plus $2 million or so for students and Four Areas
                            food-for-work deal). Perhaps $20 million is available for project loans
                            but nobody is pushing this.</p>
                        <p>If Algeria were Chad or Dahomey, I'd worry less, but it's the key to the
                            Maghreb on the one really important coast of Africa. It's worth a larger
                            investment than at present (compared to over $300 million on Congo or
                            $50-55 million on Guinea through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            64).</p>
                        <p>More important than aid, however, is to be reasonably sympathetic during
                                <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss>'s Sturm und Drang period, no
                            matter how outrageously he may behave. Like Nasser, he may take what he
                            wants from the Soviets without leaning too far East, if we keep a
                            Western door open too. Here again, the problem is how to stay on good
                            terms with a young, doctrinaire and dubious regime, braving the
                            necessary criticism (from Morocco and Tunisia as well as domestically)
                            while keeping our eyes on the long pull. I'm sure the President feels
                            this way, yet unless he gives a clear signal (e.g. by such gestures as
                            receiving <gloss target="#t_BB1">BB</gloss>, or sending suitable
                            delegation to 1 November celebration), the bureaucracy is going to stay
                                timid.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">On October 17, <persName

                        <p>I know Yazid and think you can be quite direct with him. Indeed a show of
                            some umbrage on last two points would be useful. Algeria has been
                            getting a bad press because of its own actions, including the manner in
                            which it has gone out of its way to befriend Castro. As for very modest
                            US business interests in Morocco influencing our policy, this is
                            nonsense. Nor do US firms have <hi rend="italic">any stake</hi> in

                        <p>The basic message we want to get to <persName>Ben Bella</persName> is
                            that we want to be on good terms with Algeria. In fact, we've leaned a

                            the way he let Soviet missiles in. As a practical fact, Algerian
                            partiality toward Cuba is simply going to cool US-Algerian relations. As
                            to Cuba as a model of Socialist development, only a staggering Soviet
                            subsidy keeps the place from falling apart. Castro can't even grow sugar

                            <item>The sum of the political and economic difficulties facing Algeria
                                make the achievement of real political stability an uncertain
                                prospect for <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0162"/>some time to
                                come. For the present, however, <persName>Ben Bella</persName>
                                clearly remains the political personality with the widest popular
                                appeal and he appears to have a fairly firm grip on such
                                governmental institutions as exist in Algeria. His recent
                                negotiations with the Kayble dissidents and other opponents seem
                                likely to contain further threats of armed revolt for the time
                                being. Over time, the greatest danger to him would arise from an
                                erosion of his popular support as a consequence of continued
                                economic misery or of military reverses on the Moroccan border
                                conflict. (Paras 29-36)</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>No early improvement in the country's serious economic condition
                                is likely. European colonization gave independent Algeria an
                                impressive physical plant in terms of industries and transportation
                                links, but the exodus left it with only a tiny fragment of trained
                                people necessary to run it. At best, Algeria will probably make only
                                modest progress in putting idle industrial capacity to work, with
                                the result that massive unemployment will continue for some time to
                                plague the three million Algerians in the cities. We think it likley
                                that the nationalized agricultural properties will experience
                                considerable trouble in maintaining a minimum level of subsistence
                                in rural areas. However, Algeria will need to import food for many
                                years to come. (Paras. 2-4, 24-28)</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>For a number of years foreign aid will play a critical role in
                                keeping Algeria from financial collapse and in feeding the country.
                                France will almost certainly continue to provide a substantial level
                                of developmental and budgetary assistance for at least the next two
                                years or so. Nevertheless, the Franco-Algerian relationship will be
                                delicate and there will almost certainly be strains, perhaps arising
                                from the use of the Saharan test sites or disagreements over oil
                                revenues, which could threaten the flow of French aid. (Paras. 21,
                                46-48)</item>

                            <item>In the absence of a Franco-Algerian rupture, the Soviet Union is
                                unlikely to play a major role in Algeria. If relations with France
                                deteriorate, Algiers would probably try to obtain more aid from both
                                the US and the Soviet Bloc. Under present circumstances, the Soviets
                                seem to realize that they cannot compete with France and are content
                                to establish a presence, get into the military field where possible,
                                and take advantage of any opportunities which may occur. (Paras.
                                44-45, 49)</item>
                            <label>E.</label>
                            <item>Algeria's general foreign policy will continue to be governed by
                                the desire of its leaders to align themselves broadly with the
                                neutralist bloc and to oppose “imperialism”. This general attitude
                                will from time to time bring frictions not only with France but with
                                the US and other Western Powers as well. One major source of such
                                frictions will be Algeria's effort to play a prominent role in
                                encouraging revolutionary independ-ence movements in Africa, a
                                policy to which the regime seems fairly well committed. Links to the
                                eastern Arab world are unlikely to be of major importance to
                                Algeria's policy, but <persName>Ben Bella</persName> will probably
                                continue <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0163"/>to look to Cairo
                                for assistance and will cooperate with Nasser on an ad hoc basis.
                                (Paras. 37, 42-43, 49)</item>
                            <label>F.</label>
                            <item>Prospects for a final settlement of the Moroccan border conflict
                                are not promising. Incidents in the disputed border areas are likely
                                to be endemic and could lead to outbreaks of larger scale fighting.
                                If this occurs or if an arms buildup continues because no political
                                settlement can be reached, there may be increasing pressure on the
                                great powers to declare themselves and to give material support. On
                                the whole, however, we believe that if the US preserves a generally
                                neutral stance the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be
                                disposed to limit its intervention. The effort of the other African
                                states to find a solution through the Organization for African Unity
                                    (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>) will also help to insulate
                                the struggle from the wider issues of the cold war. (Paras.

                                    agreement was based upon the conviction of the two sovereign
                                    governments that the cooperation envisaged in the agreement
                                    would contribute to the maintenance of international peace and
                                    security within the framework of the Charter of the United
                                    Nations. The agreement was freely entered into by both parties
                                    and has since been carried out in close cooperation and
                                    consultation. Satisfaction with the arrangements made was
                                    reaffirmed by the two governments during discussions held in

                                Fekini told President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                                that Libya could look forward to becoming economically
                                self-sufficient in another 4-5 years and that he hoped the United
                                States would be able during this period to give Libya's economic and
                                financial needs special consideration. President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> said that he would look
                                into the matter once the foreign aid legislation currently before
                                Congress was enacted. (Memorandum of conversation; ibid.,
                                773.5-MSP/9-1461)</note> He reviewed background starting with 1954

                            dissatisfaction of people”) of Libyan-American reconstruction
                            cooperation and joint services and eventual creation of development

                        <p>Although rental of Wheelus had proceeded successfully, American economic
                            assistance to Libya in past, regulated by annual appropriations, had
                            been difficult for planning purposes but this year had virtually ceased.
                            Popular pressures against foreign military bases in Libya continued to
                            build up. It was important that US economic aid continue so that Libyan
                            Government could show people mutually beneficial aspects of US-Libyan
                            agreements. Prime Minister had instructed Foreign Minister to set the
                            foregoing down in memorandum which would soon be presented to US.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister concluded with assurances continued cooperation, etc.</p>
                        <p>I made polite non-committal reply, saying would examine problem on
                            receipt of memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">On October 24,

                                noted that 10 years of U.S. economic aid had not had the economic

                        </list>
                        <p>I recommend that Hasan al-Rida al-Sanusi, Crown Prince of Libya, be
                            invited to visit the United States officially in November 1962, or, if
                            more convenient, in the Spring of 1963. Despite our considerable
                            strategic interests in Libya, represented particularly by Wheelus Air
                            Base, and our growing economic interests there in consequence of the
                            recent discovery and development by American companies of extensive
                            petroleum reserves, we have not had a visit by the Libyan Chief of
                            State, 72-year-old King Idris I, who has an aversion to travel outside
                            his kingdom. The Crown Prince's visit would serve as a substitute for a
                            State Visit by the King and would reinforce the favorable disposition
                            towards the United States of the young man who is scheduled to be
                            Libya's next Chief of State. It would also, by enhancing the Crown
                            Prince's prestige among the Libyan people, improve the chances for an
                            orderly succession on the death or abdication of King Idris; we feel
                            that a continuation of the Libyan constitutional monarchy under Hasan
                            al-Rida represents the best available means for ensuring the continued
                            unity, independence, and stability of Libya under circumstances most
                            favorable to United States interests there. Finally, the visit would
                            serve as a dramatic demonstration to the Libyan people of the close ties
                            between the two countries and as a reminder, at a time when Libya is on
                            the verge of financial independence from oil revenues, of the value
                            Libya has received in the form of aid in the past and may expect to
                            derive in other forms in the future from close cooperation with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I would expect that your participation in the visit, which will consist
                            of two days in Washington and several days outside the capital, would be
                            limited to hosting a State luncheon, followed by a meeting, attending a
                            return reception at Blair House and receiving the Crown Prince again at
                            the White House prior to his departure from Washington. We do not
                            anticipate any substantive talks.</p>

                                >Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> met with
                                Belkhair, who was on an unofficial visit to Washington en route to
                                Libya from Taiwan, on June 21. The conversation was recorded in a
                                memorandum for the record. (Ibid.)</note> to receive you at my
                            office and to discuss Libyan military problems in the full and frank
                            manner appropriate between representatives of two such friendly nations
                            as ours.</p>
                        <p>Let me say at the outset that I, like you, consider the principle of
                            close collaboration between our two countries in the strengthening of
                            the Libyan forces to be a matter beyond question. I know you will agree
                            that the U.S. through past assistance has already demonstrated the
                            sincerity of its dedication to this principle. Together with the United
                            Kingdom and in full consultation with your government, we undertook to
                            provide assistance in developing a Libyan army of 5,000 men and my
                            Government has considered this program, which was based on a detailed
                            military <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0169"/>survey, as appropriate
                            to meet Libya's minimum internal security requirements. Your Excellency
                            has recognized that the U.S. Government has responsibilities extending
                            around the world.</p>
                        <p>In light of your exposition of the need to further strengthen and
                            modernize the Libyan army, however, I am prepared to review the
                            situation for the purpose of determining the extent to which further
                            U.S. military assistance may be justified. Some additional equipment is
                            no doubt desirable. Meanwhile, to reflect my Government's intent to be
                            responsive, I have issued instructions that the delivery of certain
                            items of already-programmed equipment be expedited in order to be on
                            hand for your December 24 ceremonies this year.</p>
                        <p>As regards your desire to develop a Libyan Air Force, let me assure you
                            that the U.S. Government views this matter with sympathy. To provide the
                            nucleus for this force, we have already undertaken to train two pilots,
                            and I take this opportunity to inform you that we plan to deliver two
                            T-33 jet aircraft in 1963 when your pilots will have completed their
                            training. In addition, we plan to provide training for Libyan technical
                            personnel to maintain these aircraft. Finally, we are prepared to send
                            to Libya a team of selected personnel from the Department of Defense to
                            assist you in planning for the future development of the Libyan Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>I am, however, obliged to state frankly that your request for more
                            equipment for the Libyan Army appears to me, in a number of respects, to
                            be excessive to your present military needs and capabilities,
                            particularly in view of the 5,000-man ceiling, including both combat and
                            support troops, which you stated to me that you have placed on the size
                            of your army. Past experience makes clear, for example, that the U.S.
                            Congress would be unlikely to provide funds for far more vehicles per
                            soldier in the Libyan army than we supply to our own forces.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I feel that such portion of your request as might be
                            provided by the U.S. Government on a grant basis must be determined on
                            the basis of a detailed re-examination of your requirements at the
                            military level in Libya by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in
                            consultation with Libyan military officials.</p>
                        <p>As I stated to you, the Department of Defense is prepared to send
                            additional qualified personnel to Libya to assist in this
                            re-examination. Furthermore, in view of the role of Great Britain in the
                            training of the Libyan army, I feel that this study should be
                            coordinated not only between representatives of our two governments but
                            also with appropriate British officials. I can assure you that I will
                            give my closest personal attention to the recommendations which result
                            from this reassessment. Should your government feel that additional
                            materiel is still required beyond that which the U.S. agrees to provide
                            as a grant following this study, the <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142"
                                facs="0170"/>Department of Defense would be willing to help the
                            Libyan Government to arrange the purchase of such additional
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>I trust, Excellency, that this plan of procedure meets with your
                            approval, as I believe it provides the best means of ensuring that the
                            continued cooperation we both desire will proceed on a mutually
                            satisfactory basis.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2"> Belkhair thanked the

                            Backing Hasan is a gamble. We [less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified] have been pleasantly surprised by the way he has handled
                            himself as Regent in the King's few absences. But we want to prod him
                            toward further initiatives on his own behalf—developing a progressive
                            program to carry out when he becomes king and building his own political

                                    a better bet to hold Libya together than even any of the better

                                    pretty good, but the country's finances are a mess. Unless order
                                    is brought out of chaos, increasing oil revenues ($40 million

                                proposed. He added that this would do more than anything else to

                            <item>The US military interest in Libya centers primarily on the
                                continued use of Wheelus Air Base. From a military point of view
                                there is no requirement for assistance to Libya beyond that
                                necessary to assure the unrestricted use of this air base by the
                                United States and to preclude increased Communist influence in
                                Libya. Conditions necessary for such <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147"
                                    facs="0175"/>assurance include a friendly Libyan Government,
                                internal stability, and internal security. There is a need to
                                establish conditions in Libya which will favor an orderly transfer
                                of power to a Western-oriented group upon the death of King Idris.
                                However, there is no present external threat to Libya. Further,
                                Libya's treaty with the United Kingdom guarantees that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will come to the assistance of Libya
                                in the event of an attack. For these reasons, and especially in view
                                of the prospects of continually decreasing military assistance
                                funds, the United States should carefully scrutinize any proposal
                                for assistance to Libya with a view toward providing the very
                                minimum necessary to realize the US objectives. The Survey Team
                                Reports have been examined with this principle in mind.</item>

                            <item>The Report on the Development of Libyan Air Force, dated 12
                                September 1962, provides for establishment of a Libyan Air Force of
                                four T-33 jet trainer aircraft, six C-47 transport aircraft, two E-4
                                helicopters, and ancillary equipment at a cost of approximately $3
                                million over a six-year period. It is understood that the program
                                outlined in this Report has been approved by you, except for the
                                light helicopters, and that the President has informed the Libyan
                                Crown Prince of the intention to provide this assistance. In order
                                that the Government of Libya may have access to remote areas,

                                of $9.8 million over the period <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                                1962-66. In light of the fact that the Libyan Army need not be
                                manned and equipped for countering an external threat, the program
                                recommended in the Report appears excessive. Also, it is believed
                                that such a program is larger than can be afforded under present and
                                anticipated availability of funds. Accordingly, certain reductions
                                should be made in the proposed Army Program. Since <gloss
                                    target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> must incorporate Libyan
                                MAPs within his over-all <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> dollar
                                ceiling, he should be given an opportunity to recommend revisions to
                                the US Army Survey Team Report toward the objective of reducing the
                                cost of the program set forth in the Report. In revising the Report,
                                two primary objectives should be kept in mind: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>
                                    <item>The over-all cost of the program must be reduced. In

                                        this end, $6 million is believed reasonable, taking into
                                        consideration the size of the army, the type of equipment
                                        needed for the internal security mission, and the
                                        possibility of negotiating a cost-sharing formula.</item>

                                    <item>In establishing the size and organization of the proposed
                                        Libyan Army, primary emphasis should be placed on the
                                        mission of internal security. In this regard, cognizance
                                        must be taken of the 5,000 man army ceiling previously
                                        agreed upon between you and the Libyan Minister of Defense
                                        in the context of developing Libyan materiel

                            <item>Consideration should also be given to a cost-sharing formula with
                                Libya. It is noted that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64-68
                                Military Assistance Plan for support of the Libyan Air Force has
                                been prepared on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis. However, two factors
                                are of especial importance with regard to Libya. First, assistance
                                to Libya is actually payment for the use of facilities in Libya and
                                a cost-shared program has far less bargaining power than an outright
                                grant program, especially to a poor country. Second, increasing oil
                                revenues are expected to materially improve Libya's economic
                                position over the next several years. These two factors might be
                                satisfied through negotiations with Libya toward a cost-sharing
                                formula whereby the United States would pay the entire cost of
                                military assistance furnished Libya for the first two years with the
                                US proportion of costs thereafter being reduced each year. Perhaps a
                                US ratio of 75% the third year, 50% the fourth year, and 25% the
                                fifth year would be acceptable to both countries.</item>

                            <item>Finally, the Army Report recommends that materiel valued at nearly
                                $1 million be delivered in Libya prior to 24 December 1962, Libya's
                                National Independence Day. Shipment of such a large quantity of
                                materiel in the short time remaining before 24 December is
                                impractical and could be accomplished only by establishing an
                                overriding priority for Libyan requirements. However, it is
                                considered desirable that a token shipment be made prior to that
                                date. Ten M-113 armored personnel carriers could be diverted from
                                other claimants, if such action was directed, and would give visible
                                evidence of US intentions to further assist Libya in establishing an
                                effective army.</item>

                            this matter urgent, as the Libyan Parliament is meeting next week so
                            that notice of this proposed program would give them a firm basis as
                            well as cementing US-Libyan relations at a time when there have been
                            recurrent threats of Libya turning to the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss> or the Soviets for help.</p>
                        <p>Following the visit of the Libyan <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>
                            last summer, we agreed to send Air Force and Army Survey teams to Libya.
                            The Air Force team recommended a total of $2.6 million in equipment, and
                            on 17 October you approved this with the exception of two helicopters,
                            totalling $120,000. We have since learned that the Libyans considered
                            the two helicopters included in the package as stated in general terms
                            by the President, and for this reason as well as to meet what appears a
                            legitimate requirement for command communications, we now recommend that
                            you approve their re-insertion.</p>
                        <p>The Army problem is more serious. The Army Survey team recommended a
                            program of $9.8 million for an 8500 man force over a five-year period,
                            as being required to enhance its internal security capability and insure
                            its superiority over that of the provincial police forces. This plan
                            called for us to fill initial shortages in the proposed modernization
                            and standardization of the Libyan Army with heavy equipment required,
                            including communications and vehicles but with the Libyan Government
                            being responsible for the cost (about $1 million) of small items and
                            maintenance of British equipment which we have furnished in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>When you approved the bulk of the Air Force team recommendations, you
                            directed that the total program be held to a level of $1.5 million per
                            year. Your discussions with the Libyan <gloss target="#t_MOD1"
                                >MOD</gloss> had also indicated that <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152"
                                facs="0180"/>he personally accepted maintenance of the present Army
                            force level of 5000 men. Accordingly,<gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1"
                                >USCINCEUR</gloss> was asked to review the Army Survey Report under
                            these guidelines, and specifically to eliminate M-48 tanks and 155mm
                            howitzers, which the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had questioned
                            on purely military grounds as not being necessary to the internal
                            security mission.</p>
                        <p>The revised report just received from CINCEUR proposes a program in
                            accordance with the revised guidelines calling for $4.7 million in new
                            equipment plus maintenance amounting to $1.2 million and reinserting the
                            $1 million to maintain previously supplied British equipment, for a
                            total of $6.9 million over the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63-67
                            period. This plan would support only the 5000 man force level and would
                            not provide for replacement of key old British items (hence the
                            recommendation that we include maintenance of this equipment in
                            toto).</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador had supported the original Survey Report as being the
                            minimum required to maintain our status at Wheelus and prevent Libya
                            turning elsewhere. In addition, both State and <gloss

                            Ambassador's grounds, <gloss target="#t_USCINCEUR1">USCINCEUR</gloss> on
                            the military basis that this reduced program would not provide clear
                            superiority of the Army over the Provincial Police (also about 5000
                            strong in Tripolitania alone), a political objective stated as essential
                            by the Ambassador and State to prevent a sundering of Libya when Idris
                            dies. Both the Ambassador<note n="1" xml:id="d102fn1">On November 9,
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JJW2">Jones</persName> wrote that
                                he regretted the Defense decision to re-examine the U.S. Army Survey
                                Team report with the view of reducing the proposed strength of the
                                Libyan Army and the recommended program of U.S. military aid. He
                                noted that if the United States was not sufficiently forthcoming in
                                response to Libyan requests for assistance, it could expect
                                questions regarding the present level of rent for Wheelus. Jones
                                reminded Washington that the Libyan Army might well be the deciding
                                influence in a possible crisis over succession to the throne after
                                the death of the King. Finally, he emphasized the relationship of
                                the overall U.S. military aid program to the success of the recent
                                visit of the Crown Prince. (Telegram 98 from Benghazi; Department of

                        <p>For <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963, the presently approved figure
                            is $1.473, which includes some Army items now subsumed in the total
                            program. Thus, we would add a little over $500,000 to this. This would
                            come from the Contingency Fund.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, this is an issue of judgment. Wheelus matters to us, the
                            flighty Libyans could turn elsewhere, and there is some case for an
                            internal security force clearly capable of dominating the scene. The
                            Libyans do expect a measure of aid for Wheelus, and over time, with
                            their oil coming in the US will not have much to offer through economic
                            aid. All in all, though I hate these rug merchant deals (and these
                            particular rug merchants) as much as you do, I would endorse State's
                            judgment that the rug cannot be had for less. It may at least stay
                            bought if we can lay out the whole program to the Libyans next week.</p>

                                he did not have the impression Libya was about to demand that the

                        <p>Our attention has recently been focused on the future of Wheelus Air Base
                            by 1) the resolutions at the Addis Ababa conference; 2) the organization
                            of a Libyan Air Force; and 3) Libyan requests for additional aid.</p>
                        <p>Criticism in the Libyan press and on the floor of the Libyan Parliament
                            of the presence of a foreign base on Libyan soil, while not new, has
                            recently become more pointed as a result of the resolution, adopted by
                            the African summit conference at Addis Ababa in June, that African
                            states should negotiate the elimination of military bases from their
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The relatively new and more “nationalist” government of Prime Minister
                            Fekini has shown itself sensitive on this subject, and has avoided
                            denying forthrightly and publicly that it contemplates measures to
                            eliminate the Wheelus Air Base. During discussion of a possible joint
                            statement on the recently-expanded U.S. military assistance program,
                            including the allocation of a part of Wheelus Base for the use of the
                            new Libyan Air Force, Fekini attempted to introduce language suggesting
                            that this action was preparatory to the take-over of the entire base by
                            the Libyans. As demonstrated by the good-will trip he has just concluded
                            to the Maghreb states, and by his recent public remarks on Palestine,
                            the Prime Minister desires to associate Libya more closely with the
                            mainstream of African and Arab unity movements.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0185"/>
                        <p>We see no indication, however, that the basic Libyan policy of respecting
                            the Wheelus Air Base Agreement (which expires in December, 1970) has
                            been altered; indeed, a high Foreign Ministry official has assured our
                            Embassy that such is not the case. However, under arrangements made with
                            the Libyans in 1960, the $10,000,000 annual “rent” payment for the base
                            is reduced to $1,000,000 at the end of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                            1964. We interpret recent, unfocused, requests for U.S. economic aid by
                            Fekini and certain of his ministers as an effort to establish a
                            favorable bargaining position for discussions on the future quid pro quo
                            for the Base in anticipation of this reduction. As Libyan oil revenues
                            grow, the economic justification declines, but the political pressures
                            for such payment will remain.</p>
                        <p>The assignment to the Royal Libyan Air Force of facilities at Wheelus
                            gives Libya a stake in the Base which we anticipate will be a moderating
                            factor in Libyan attitudes toward the future presence of Wheelus.</p>
                        <p>King Idris retains ultimate control over Libyan policy, and the cabinet
                            could take no fundamental action affecting the Wheelus Base without the

                        <p>The Wheelus Base is used primarily as a very important all weather

                            ascertained the views of the Armed Forces, we understand that the Base
                            will be required at least during the life of the present agreement,

                        <p>Monday morning session with new Libyan <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>
                            Fekini is so you can gently talk him out of asking for a whole new aid
                            program.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>This country of only 1,250,000 has lived on US largesse for years ($206
                            million through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963). Now it's
                            swimming in oil—$64 million royalties this year, over $100 million next
                            year, and up to $300 million annually later. So it is another Kuwait,
                            which doesn't need any more US aid.</p>
                        <p>But Fekini is using Wheelus base as a lever to pry more aid out of us.
                            Under our 1960 agreement the “rent” for Wheelus will drop from $10
                            million annually 1960-64 to $1 million per annum 1965-71. He alleges
                            growing local anti-base pressures, and says the best way to offset this
                            is a big contribution to Libyan development.</p>
                        <p>Our best counter is to tell him frankly that Wheelus (and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases in Cyrenaica) are oil-rich Libya's
                            best guarantee against takeover by Nasser next door. Our presence is
                            Libya's real security. <hi rend="italic">We don't see why we should have
                                to pay for the privilege of giving protection</hi> (and he should
                            get this across to his critics). Besides, it is mostly US investment
                            which provides Libya's oil wealth. So you could explain why Congress
                            won't favor yet more aid to a country which is doing so well (we don't
                            give aid to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait either—yet protect both).</p>
                        <p>We want to make clear that what Libya needs is not money but technical
                            help in learning to use wisely all the money it's already getting (and
                            squandering). We're prepared to continue providing such help, and also
                            some more <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Fekini may also make some anti-Israeli noises; if so, you might set him
                            straight that we don't intend to let Arabs attack Israel or vice
                            versa.</p>
                        <p>You impressed Fekini greatly last time he saw you (he was ambassador
                            here) by airing some general policy views. He'll be quite responsive if
                            you do so again.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">On September 30, <persName

                                to the President, explaining that in 1960 the United States had
                                “upped the ante (1) to keep Wheelus, (2) to take credit for help we
                                were giving anyway to ease the Libyan government over the hump until
                                oil revenues put it on its feet, but (3) to leave the door open to
                                stop grant aid when oil revenues began pouring in.” He noted that
                                those revenues had mounted faster than anyone expected “so while we
                                have to come through with the promised $10 million next year, we
                                want to hold the line after that.” (<persName corresp="#p_KJF2"

                        <p>President welcomed Fekini, who replied he brought friendly greeting from
                            King and Crown Prince. After brief mention Fekini's recent trip Algeria,
                            Morocco, Tunisia, President inquired about situation in Libya. Fekini
                            said public opinion had favored more unified organization of government
                            and so his government had amended constitution to bring this about. His
                            government had also worked out new 5-year plan and hoped US would help
                            in realizing this plan. Plan was key to stability in Libya, and Libya
                            was counting on US.</p>
                        <p>President described heavy aid cuts being made by Congress and great
                            difficulties this created for US. We were nonetheless trying to do what
                            we could. But with all its oil resources Libya's position should be
                            extremely good on its own.</p>
                        <p>Fekini replied that oil revenue would be main support of Plan, but real
                            problem would be in first 2 or 3 years before most oil revenues came in.
                            Fekini said US had special relationship with Libya, for example, one of
                            our most important military bases is there, and Libya had problem with
                            such bases.</p>
                        <p>President said had noted press attacks on base, but base was important to
                            stability of area and kind of guarantee of Libya's continued
                            independence and stability. Thus it was best to try damp down press
                            attacks and not make Wheelus great dominant political issue.</p>
                        <p>Fekini acknowledged Wheelus not at present big political issue, but
                            remarked US effort to help Libya substantially would serve to remove
                            base issue from domestic political arena.</p>
                        <p>President emphasized burden our global commitments many of which were of
                            indirect benefit to Libya. Libya, like Saudi Arabia, will be target for
                            other countries because of its oil wealth. US would do its best but
                            couldn't do all Libya wanted. President urged Fekini use his influence
                                <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0188"/>explain to Libyan people
                            Wheelus helpful to Libyan stability and an asset to Libya. Then when
                            Libya wanted us to leave we would. But if we're told we must either
                            contribute to development plan or lose base, we'd leave.</p>
                        <p>Fekini later said he had spoken frankly because it not easy task to
                            defend base. Only one million dollars rent did not look very great even
                            though there was other aid.</p>
                        <p>President replied Libya had only 1.25 million people yet <gloss
                                target="#t_GOL1">GOL</gloss> receiving over $60 million from oil
                            revenues this year, probably $100 million next and perhaps as much as
                            $300 million within few years. We appreciated Libya's situation and its
                            needs, but such oil revenues obviously a major asset.</p>
                        <p>Fekini mentioned that US allowing Libya use small part of base to train
                            Libyan Air Force, which US was supporting. Sharing of base was good, and
                            if we could go further toward joint use it would help. President agreed
                            this would be useful.</p>
                        <p>Conversation concluded with comments by Fekini and President concerning
                            need for caution in viewing prospects for detente in relations with
                            Soviets.</p>
                        <p>After their conversation President invited Fekini to attend swearing in
                            of new Postmaster General, and Fekini there met several members of
                            Cabinet. Later President accompanied Fekini to President's outer office
                            and shook hands with officers of Libyan Embassy. President sent
                            greetings through Fekini to King and Crown Prince and suggested Fekini
                            write to him directly if he wished on matters of mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>President had sent presidential Air Force aircraft bring Fekini from New
                            York and return him there. Governor Harriman met Fekini at Washington
                            airport. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                            present at meeting with President and accompanied Fekini to Washington
                            airport. Fekini brought from New York private secretary Ali Abu Suwayl
                            and Police Major Tahir Rahuma. Ben Gileil, counselor of Embassy, only
                            Libyan with Fekini during meeting with President.</p>

                        <p>The Departments of State and Defense are concerned over the arrival in
                            Morocco of twelve Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17 jet
                            fighters and two <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-15 trainers for the
                            Moroccan Air Force. There are indications that twenty to thirty Bloc
                            technicians may also have arrived, although this is not yet fully
                            confirmed. The Department of Defense is particularly concerned about the
                            significant threat to the security and potential usefulness of our
                            military bases in Morocco, including the <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> complex, that would be represented by the presence in
                            Morocco of Soviet military equipment and personnel. Last November when
                            Moroccan acceptance of the Soviet offer of jet planes was announced our
                            Ambassador obtained oral assurances from the King and the Crown Prince
                            that they would do nothing in this connection to affect Morocco's
                            commitment (reached between the King and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in December 1959) to permit
                            us to remain at our bases until the end of 1963. Those assurances
                            included an undertaking not to admit any Soviet bloc technicians into
                            Morocco. There is thus some question whether or not this undertaking has
                            been breached.</p>
                        <p>With my approval, and the consent of Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName>, we have arranged to send
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> back to Rabat
                            this weekend, ostensibly to take his official farewell of the Moroccan
                            Government. We are in fact anxious that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> explore with the King personally
                            the significance of the arrival of Soviet jets and perhaps technicians.
                            Last December we provided the Ambassador with a standby authority to
                            offer U.S. jet planes to the Moroccan Government if he felt this was
                            necessary to insure that the Moroccan Government would not make use of
                            the Soviet planes, or as a minimum would refuse to accept any Soviet

                            assurances mentioned above, the Ambassador did not feel it necessary to
                            use this standby offer at the time. However it is still valid and it is
                            our intention that the Ambassador would be prepared to make the offer
                            explicit to the King if the trend of their conversation indicated this
                            as the best course.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> feels, and both
                            the African Bureau and I concur, that it would be particularly valuable
                            to him in his delicate mission to be able to present to the King a
                            message from you. The letter would have a dual purpose, to reaffirm our
                            good will and desire to continue our cooperation with Morocco and at the
                            same time to emphasize the gravity with which we view the latest
                            developments. The enclosed text will show what we have in mind and would
                            enable Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> to enter
                            into a detailed discussion of the problem with the King. (I might add
                            that the occasion could also provide an unusual opportunity to ascertain
                            current Moroccan intentions with regard to the Congo and Algeria.)</p>

                                of jets or in addition thereto), you may say you will personally
                                recommend that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> give prompt and
                                sympathetic consideration to King's wishes. Such assistance would of
                                course likewise be to subject to conditions specified para (1).
                                    <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Regarding possibilities
                                discussed Hare meeting Feb. 18 for improving US offer over that
                                contemplated <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 771,
                                additional assistance would of course require further formal action
                                here, including Presidential determination. If King prefers military
                                air transport to combat aircraft Defense thinks C-54's could be made
                                available. If he wants such transport aircraft in addition to
                                F-86's, this possibility too could be examined. If what he wants is
                                improved type jet, there is possibility obtaining F-100D's. If
                                delivery any foregoing urgently required, planes could probably be
                                taken from US operational units and delivered to Morocco in 15 to 30
                                days. Action to implement any part of foregoing would first require
                                your recommendation based on conversation with King and then formal
                                clearance and authorization as above, which we would undertake to
                                obtain as rapidly as possible. Obviously we do not wish to go any
                                further into aircraft aid than situation requires and of course
                                would not wish contemplate such aid at all unless it achieves
                                objectives para (1). But foregoing intended indicate to you lengths
                                to which we are willing to try to go to achieve these objectives.

                            of effect any retaliatory measures on overall US interests. US economic
                            aid suggests itself as one area where US could make its displeasure
                            felt. While pressures this regard, particularly those likely to be felt
                            by or revealed to Moroccan public, run risk at some point of dangerous
                            counter-effects, it might be possible take certain meaningful steps in
                            our dealings with <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> officials. For
                            example, while $40 million aid figure has been announced to <gloss

                            terms $20 million loan (requiring written Battle Act assurances, etc.).
                            In last analysis, however, this or any other form of reprisal would
                            raise grave considerations requiring most careful study. End <gloss

                            this week with the King, the Crown Prince and other key Moroccan
                            officials. Characteristically, <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0194"
                            />the King reserved comment on your letter until a later audience, but
                            did repeat his assurances that nothing would be done to affect the U.S.
                            bases. The Ambassador is planning to offer U.S. jets on condition that
                            Soviet technicians be excluded from Morocco.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I think you should know that, in addition to the
                            squadron of F-86's which the Ambassador is authorized to offer the King,
                            the Ambassador is also authorized to say he will report sympathetically
                            any interest the King expresses in a later model of U.S. jet fighter or
                            in military air transport. The offer of any U.S. aircraft, however, is
                            contingent on satisfactory assurances from the King that Morocco will
                            store the Soviet jets and in any case will not permit Soviet technicians
                            to remain in the country. As my memorandum of February 17 in connection
                            with the message to the King pointed out,<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3"
                                    ><ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> the Department
                            of Defense feels very strongly about the threat which Soviet planes and
                            technicians would pose for our military bases in Morocco, a threat which
                            Defense feels, moreover, extends to our Spanish bases, the Sixth Fleet
                            and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s southern flank in general.
                            Defense feels so strongly about this matter that it is willing to go a
                            long way to satisfy Moroccan military air requirements despite the
                            political disadvantages in so doing, including the tinge of blackmail
                            that would color such a move to block the Soviet military presence.</p>
                        <p>A Presidential determination to cover as much as $6.8 million for F-86's
                            was granted on December 6, 1960, but Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> did not then feel it necessary to
                            draw on the standby authority given him. If it is now necessary to go
                            beyond this earlier proposition, either by furnishing a later type of
                            jet or by providing military transport aircraft, the cost might rise
                            appreciably and would require a further Presidential determination. I
                            understand Defense estimates that a squadron of F-100-Ds might cost as
                            much as $20 million, not including the expenses for spares and
                            maintenance. I do not know that it will be necessary to go to these
                            lengths. Much depends on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1"
                                >Yost</persName>'s success in getting the Moroccans to reaffirm
                            their earlier assurances that Soviet technicians would not be permitted
                            in Morocco. We have strong indications that Soviet personnel are already
                            there, but they may be an assembly crew which will soon depart. In any
                            case, I thought you should know where this matter now stands. The
                            Moroccan Government under the initiative of the Crown Prince, does
                            appear to be opening itself dangerously to Soviet assistance. It is not
                            difficult to understand why the Pentagon is apprehensive about this
                            development, given the importance of our bases in Morocco and in Spain
                            as well as Morocco's strategic position on the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The differences between the United States and Morocco over Mauretania are
                            simply stated. Morocco maintains that the government of Mauretania is a
                            puppet regime, fabricated and supported by France to prevent the return
                            to Morocco of territory rightfully hers. Morocco was of course anxious
                            for the support of the United States, as a great power. We have in
                            effect refused this by recognizing the independence of Mauretania and by
                            showing our willingness to vote for Mauretania's admission to the United
                            Nations. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has, for ulterior reasons,
                            favored Morocco in this dispute.</p>
                        <p>Morocco's political claims are not based on conclusive evidence, but
                            there are cultural, ethnic and religious links between the two
                            countries. Roughly two thirds of Mauretania's mainly nomadic population
                            of about 600,000 are Moorish. Only along the Senegal river in the south
                            is the population predominantly negroid. So far as we can judge, most of
                            the Mauretanian tribal and religious chiefs who presently dominate local
                            politics acknowledge the authority of the government of Mauretania's
                            Prime Minister Moktar Ould Daddah, but there is some internal opposition
                            and Morocco makes much of several prominent Mauretanians who have gone
                            into voluntary exile in Morocco and hold important government posts
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Morocco bases its claims on historical links (however tenuous) going back
                            to the early days of Islam in North Africa, on the traditional fealty
                            alleged to have been paid the Sultans of Morocco and, of course, on the
                            “true wishes” of the Mauretanian population. To back the latter
                            assertion Morocco has proposed the holding of a plebiscite under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices.</p>
                        <p>France, on the other hand, alleges that national sovereignty in the
                            present day legal sense did not exist in this remote and desolate land
                                <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0196"/>until the French arrived
                            toward the latter part of the last century. The authority of independent
                            Mauretania's present government is held to derive from the French right
                            of conquest and from the elections which led to self-government.</p>
                        <p>What has made the US position particularly uncomfortable is the open and
                            determined espousal of the Moroccan claim by King Mohammed himself.
                            Furthermore, the claim has at least the overt backing of all political
                            tendencies in Morocco and it would now be virtually impossible for the
                            King or anyone else in Morocco to back off from it.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d111fn1">While the above was written prior to King
                                Mohammed's death the new King can be expected to pursue this claim
                                with equal, if not even greater, vigor. [Footnote in the source

                                Rabat, February 26; ibid., 771.11/2-2661)]</note> At the very least,
                            a face-saving device of some sort would have to be provided.</p>
                        <p>We had hoped that there would be sufficient opposition to Morocco on this
                            issue from other African countries to deflect Moroccan ire from us. This
                            indeed appeared to be the situation at the time we recognized
                            Mauretania's independence but the situation since then has become a good
                            deal more equivocal. While many nations have recognized Mauretania's
                            independence and, therefore, would presumably vote for its entry into
                            the United Nations, Morocco by skillful horse trading with other nations
                            with policies in need of support, has succeeded in lining up behind
                            itself a group of assertive, radical Afro-Asian states. All of the
                            10-member Arab League, except Tunisia, and there is recent indication
                            that Tunisia is falling back to a more guarded position, support the
                            Moroccan position and do not recognize Mauretania. The three radical
                            West African states—Ghana, Guinea, and Mali—recognized Mauretania but
                            nevertheless approved a resolution at the recent Casablanca Conference
                            which tacitly supports Morocco's claims. Indonesia, also, has publicly
                            come out in favor of Morocco's claim, seeing therein a parallel to its
                            claim to West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has backed the Moroccan position by vetoing Mauretania's
                            application for U.N. membership, seeing in this dispute a chance to
                            exacerbate U.S. Moroccan relations and put pressure on our bases. The
                            Soviets did not take an unequivocal stand on the merits of the
                            Morocco-Mauretania dispute but sought merely to link Mauretania's
                            admission to that of Outer Mongolia. However, the Moroccan Government
                            and press have overlooked this subtlety and give the Soviets full credit
                            for blocking Mauretania's admission to the U.N.</p>
                        <p>The United States recognizes Mauretania, voted for its admission to the
                            U.N., and sent a Presidential delegation to the independence
                            celebrations in Nouakchott. Our Ambassador in Dakar is also accredited
                            to <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0197"/>Mauretania. Most Western
                            European and Latin American countries, a majority of the non-Arab Asian
                            countries, and all tropical African states have extended recognition to
                            Mauretania. France and a number of Western-oriented French-speaking
                            African states have vigorously championed Mauretania's cause.</p>
                        <p>What had been a territorial dispute of murky antecedents, is now, as a
                            result of Moroccan tenacity, being presented as an issue of colonialism
                            versus independence, a test of those who support puppets and those that
                            do not. While the other states probably are supporting Morocco for
                            tactical reasons, there is no evidence that Morocco can be dissuaded
                            from pursuing her claim.</p>

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_VHS1">Villard</persName> cogently
                            defended the Mauretanian position. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> thinks we should proceed with
                            “extreme caution” and not aid or support Mauretania “any more than is
                            absolutely unavoidable.” Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_VHS1"
                                >Villard</persName>'s recommendation was that we make a statement
                            when the question of Mauretania's membership in the U.N. comes up urging
                            Morocco and Mauretania promptly to consult on means of overcoming their
                            differences and of developing close and mutually valuable
                            collaboration.</p>
                        <p>The US thus faces a dilemma in which it cannot entirely avoid
                            antagonizing one side or the other. It is possible, however, that we can
                            limit the damage to ourselves in strategically-located Morocco, where we
                            have a particularly heavy military investment, by avoiding any
                            initiative on this primarily African question. Where we are obliged to
                            express a view, we should try to stress the interest which both parties
                            have in an amical relationship.</p>

                            to Rabat to discuss the utilization question with the Moroccan
                                authorities.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">The March 22 conversation

                            possible our essential military interests in the remaining facilities.
                            Although we have an agreement permitting us to retain our bases until
                            the end of 1963, the internal Moroccan political situation is not
                            promising and we would do well to meet constructively and not negatively
                            Moroccan pressures on us.</p>

                        <p>I am returning herewith the subject memorandum and attachment.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum of March 23, 1961 (attached to reference memorandum) on
                            “Status and Problems of U.S. Bases in Morocco,” appears a suitable basis
                            for exploring a new policy towards the Moroccan bases. I suggest,
                            therefore, that the Department of State take the leadership in seeking
                            the views of Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> as the memorandum suggests. After these
                            soundings, a definite recommendation should be made to me by the
                            Department of State, with dissenting comment from other agencies if they
                            desire. In particular, these appear to be the critical questions.</p>

                        <p>Since receipt of National Security Action Memorandum No. 34, April 5,
                            1961, the Department of State has been reviewing our present policy on
                            Moroccan bases, particularly with a view towards developing answers to
                            the questions posed in the aforementioned memorandum. It is evident that
                            the complexities of the problems involved will require considerable
                            consultation with the other agencies involved and makes possible only
                            the submission of an interim report at this time. The Department of
                            State is moving forward rapidly on the necessary consultations.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State's memorandum of March 28, 1961,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d115fn1"><ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> on
                            Moroccan bases dealt primarily with the political problems that have
                            arisen in our relations with Morocco as a result of the presence of our
                                <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>bases. While the memorandum
                            points out the real political advantages which would accrue to the
                            United States if certain actions were taken, it is evident that these
                            actions could have serious military implications. These military
                            considerations, revolving essentially around the relationship of the
                            Moroccan bases to the totality of our national security posture,
                            particularly the credibility of our nuclear deterrent and our strike
                            capability, require discussion with Defense. The Department of State
                            feels that it is essential that our recommendation to you reflect the
                            proper balance of political and military considerations to the end that
                            the actions proposed represent a net advantage to US national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the specific questions posed, it is possible at this time
                            to provide some tentative answers which will be coordinated with other
                            agencies during our consultations. On the timing of our withdrawal from
                            Nouasseur and Kenitra and the retention of our communication facilities
                            at Sidi Yahia, Bouknadel and Sidi Slimane, these are actively being
                            discussed with the Pentagon to determine their general relationship and
                            importance to over-all United States military posture. In connection
                            with this appraisal, we will also wish to consider the relationship of
                            US bases to our developing disarmament policy. This consideration might
                            well affect the timing of withdrawal for we may wish to seek to gain
                            something for such action through disarmament negotiations.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the role of United States assistance in converting those
                            bases we proposed to relinquish to civilian use, we believe there is a
                            real opportunity through this means to demonstrate our interest in
                            Morocco. The possibilities involved in this line of action are actively
                            being examined by the Department with Defense and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The question of associating ourselves with the goal of a denuclearized
                            Africa is an extremely important but difficult problem which affects our
                            policies in other areas. The pressures for a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolution establishing a denuclearized Africa require
                            careful handling because Morocco is one of the sponsoring countries.
                            Fortunately, the resolution for a denuclearized Africa has been carried
                            over to the next session so that it is not necessary to come to an
                            immediate decision on how we are to handle the matter. If military
                            considerations relating to the utility of our installations in Morocco
                            at the present time so dictate, these pressures should not be
                            encouraged, though we should not adopt a public stance against this
                            goal. There is the additional consideration that the adoption of the
                            concept of a denuclearized zone would establish a precedent for the rest
                            of the world. Undoubtedly, communist powers, as well as other nations,
                            would seize upon this precedent to argue for the extension of this
                            principle to other parts of the world which, if successful, could
                            profoundly affect our overall military posture.</p>
                        <p>With regard to securing a commitment from the Moroccans to keep Soviet
                            forces out of the surrendered bases, we have a commitment from <pb
                                n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0203"/>the late King, which King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has confirmed, that
                            the bases will never be used against us. While the present commitment
                            may not be as exact or as precise as we might desire, it is nevertheless
                            adequate. It appears that this matter can be safely deferred until
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> has had an
                            opportunity to appraise US-Moroccan relationships generally. We can then
                            determine if it is desirable to revive the question of securing a more
                            definitive commitment from the King.</p>
                        <p>On the question of whether the surrendered bases should be made available
                            to United States forces at a time of crisis, we believe that any
                            negotiations to gain us this specific right would unduly complicate our
                            relationships with Morocco. The reality of the situation is such that,
                            if the Moroccans were with us in a time of crisis, they would probably
                            permit the return of United States forces. In the event they were not
                            sympathetic with our policies and objectives at that time, it is highly
                            unlikely they would agree to the return of our forces. This, too, is a
                            matter which we feel should be deferred until we have the advantage of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName>'s
                            appraisal.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State anticipates very shortly submitting its
                            recommendations and the views of the other agencies concerned. If
                            approved they will serve as the basis for instructions to be given to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> prior to his
                            departure for Morocco.</p>

                        <p>1785. For Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName>: On
                            your arrival Morocco you will face five major problems relating to US
                            bases: (1) evacuation schedule for bases and eventual Moroccan
                            utilization thereof; (2) threat to security of bases from presence of
                            Soviet technicians who arrived with Soviet gift of <gloss
                                target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s; (3) question of post-1963 facilities;
                            (4) US military assistance to Morocco; (5) Moroccan interest in
                            increased use Nouasseur. You aware background these problems and fact
                            there has been little or no forward <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176"
                                facs="0204"/>motion since death King Mohamed V with consequent
                            disruption Moroccan Government. You know that with regard to (1) we have
                            outstanding request from new King to accelerate evacuation and to assist
                            Morocco make appropriate use of base facilities (e.g. for civil
                            aviation); (2) Soviet technicians remain in Morocco despite assurances
                            from both late and present Kings there would be no jeopardy to our
                            bases; (3) King knows we would like to retain communications facilities
                            but has given us no commitment; (4) conditional standby authority to
                            offer jets has not been used and we have not yet negotiated with Morocco
                            second slice of military assistance program for <gloss target="#t_RMA1"
                                >RMA</gloss> recommended by US Survey Team; (5) <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> authorized the <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> Commander to permit civil use of
                            Nouasseur as weather alternate to Cazes within the limits of Nouasseur's
                            civil facilities but for security reasons have withheld authorization of
                            any use by Soviet bloc civil aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Lapse of time since these questions last discussed with King and changes
                            taking place in Moroccan internal political life indicate desirability
                            your making fresh appraisal of situation and submitting to us your
                            recommendations before we take further steps. Base agreement and
                            military aid program were negotiated in 1959 with popular and respected
                            King Mohamed V and Prime Minister Ibrahim,<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1"

                            increasingly on Army and Police. This suggests we must walk narrow line
                            between over identification with monarchy under attack from some of most
                            dynamic segments population and antagonizing King to detriment our
                            objectives as long as he is in power.</p>
                        <p>We hope you can utilize your first interviews with King and ministers to
                            form judgment their intentions and prospects without being drawn into
                            new commitments, but being careful to guard against giving any
                            indication we intend to withdraw from existing ones. We particularly
                            want to obtain your estimate of best way to retain essential facilities
                            to end of 1963 and to lay ground for any possibility there may be of
                            preserving some position after 1963. You should make recommendations
                            regarding any specific gestures which would gain us concrete advantages
                            in foregoing respects, such as training Moroccans in airport management
                            and maintenance and early release of Nouasseur to Morocco with
                            assistance in the development of civil terminal facilities. In same
                            context, we would like your views on (1) when to proceed with second
                            year of military assistance program, and (2) usefulness of providing
                            planes (and whether jets or transports) to Moroccan Air Force.</p>
                        <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0205"/>
                        <p>You will of course have to use your own discretion in determining best
                            approach to King in initial encounters. To strike positive note you can
                            perhaps express interest in King's suggestions for future Moroccan
                            utilization which he promised give us after Ramadan and say we are
                            prepared, if King so wishes, to send experts to examine with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> means by which bases might be made most
                            beneficial to Morocco. You should emphasize need for careful planning to
                            avoid interference with present military requirements at bases and to
                            resolve many points of conflict that will arise in considering civil
                            use.</p>
                        <p>Some discussion of King's earlier request for accelerated evacuation is
                            probably unavoidable. You may say this matter being considered at
                            highest levels US Government but raises grave problems. World situation
                            has not improved but worsened since base agreement reached in 1959 and
                            importance of bases has therefore actually increased. While we consider
                            departure 1963 firm obligation and orderly phase-out will require
                            beginning of progressive withdrawal well before then, we are convinced
                            that under present world conditions this arrangement will impair the
                            security arrangements of the free world. We would appreciate learning
                            King's sentiments on this subject. US Government anxious to be as
                            helpful as possible but at same time hopes for sympathetic understanding
                            of its own responsibilities. You should indicate to King that it is our
                            firm conviction, and one that we would hope he shares, that the strength
                            of the free world must be preserved to assure the maintenance of peace.
                            To weaken it not only increases the chances of Soviet moves toward
                            general war but greatly augments the likelihood of Communist expansion
                            by military or covert means leading to the takeover of smaller
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>You may find occasion at this point to remind King of our interest in
                            post-1963 communications facilities and to probe how far he seems
                            willing to go by way of assurances in this regard.</p>
                        <p>You should leave King in no doubt about our continued concern over
                            presence Soviet technicians in Morocco. You can refer to assurances
                            which both King and his father gave Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> and say you would like to
                            ascertain for your government where this matter now stands. You should
                            reiterate that we consider our bases insecure so long as there are
                            Soviet pilots or instructors anywhere in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Present tenuous situation in Morocco would seem to make it inadvisable to
                            press arms or aircraft supply questions at this time. If, however, King
                            shows interest in these questions, you can refer to earlier indications
                            of our willingness to try to be of help and say you will report his
                            suggestions promptly to Washington.</p>
                        <p>You may of course repeat assurances contained President's letter conveyed
                            by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> and emphasize
                            importance which President attaches to continuing friendly relations
                            which have extended over <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0206"/>so
                            many years. At this point, you should state your view that US economic
                            assistance to Morocco over the past few years had been considerable,
                            that you understand and fully expect to support this assistance in the
                            future and look forward to examining ways in which it can be made even
                            more beneficial to Morocco. Unless you think it would arouse excessive
                            expectations you may find it useful to indicate you expect return
                            Washington within few weeks to give your views on how US-Moroccan
                            cooperation can best be enhanced.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">On June

                        <p>In your memorandum of 15 June 1961 (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1"
                                >JCSM</gloss>-409-61),<note n="1" xml:id="d117fn1">Attached but not
                                printed.</note> it was recommended that the President be given a
                            briefing on the need for retaining communications facilities in Morocco
                            after 1963 and that we urge the State Department to pursue with
                            increased vigor its efforts to obtain Moroccan concurrence to our
                            continued use of the facilities.</p>
                        <p>I have no objection to a discussion of this matter with the President. He
                            has displayed personal interest in examining the need for retention of
                            our facilities in Morocco, in light of the political liabilities
                            involved. It is suggested, however, that the Joint Chiefs may wish to
                            review for clarity <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0207"/>the
                            presentation forwarded with your memorandum of 15 June 1961. Paragraph 7
                            of the presentation (as well as paragraph 2 of the memorandum itself)
                            indicates that retention of the communications facilities in Morocco is
                            essential. Paragraph 6 of the memorandum states that acceptable
                            alternative means or sites have not yet been found. However, paragraph 5
                            of the presentation suggests that equivalent substitute facilities could
                            be found through expansion of facilities in Spain and the establishment
                            of new facilities in the Central Mediterranean area.</p>
                        <p>It would also be most useful to me to have clarification along these
                            lines for any subsequent discussion of this problem with the Secretary
                            of State. I have particularly in mind more precise information
                            concerning the effect upon our Defense Communications System should the
                            Moroccan facilities be lost after 1963 and what possible alternatives
                            there may be, including their cost, the additional land requirements
                            they entail in other countries, the minimum period of time required for
                            their development once political arrangements are completed, and the
                            specific extent, if any, to which they would not constitute equal
                            substitute facilities. This information would be especially pertinent in
                            evaluating what economic, military, political or other quid pro quo the
                            United States should be prepared to offer to retain the Moroccan
                            communications facilities after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"
                                >Bonsal</persName> submits his appraisal as to what would be
                            necessary to obtain Moroccan consent in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> is
                            expected to return on consultation in the relatively near future,<note

                            <item>Military requirements existed in December 1959 for retention of

                                military needs have become more urgent in light of significant

                                ready capability to wage limited warfare with conventional weapons.
                                Since the Joint Communique on Moroccan bases, these bases have
                                become increasingly important for possible contingency operations in
                                Africa or the Middle East. Too, our military force structure has not
                                changed from manned aircraft to missiles at a sufficient rate to

                                afforded State Department representatives a better understanding of
                                military problems in Morocco. Subsequent to this meeting, a State

                                the US Ambassador requesting that he make a fresh appraisal of the
                                situation and recommend courses of action which might fulfill
                                military requirements in Morocco. The Ambassador's recommendations
                                are expected in a few weeks at which time the Department of State is
                                expected to consult further with Defense representatives on this
                                matter.</item>

                            agreement in December 1959 stated in part that the United States would
                            withdraw from its bases in Morocco prior to December 31, 1963 with the
                            possible exception of certain communications facilities in Kenitra. This
                            latter exception was deliberately included to protect and retain if
                            possible, not only the Navy's main radio [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            Navy air and sea communications facilities in Kenitra proper. This
                            complex is the Navy's most important in the European-African area.</p>
                        <p>It is the Navy's position that if certain moves are made, she will be
                            able to keep her very important naval communications installations near
                            Port Lyautey. Our justification for this position is based on the
                            following.</p>

                                that Counihan had met personally with the President following his

                                with its previous decision assigning him to Washington. Noting that
                                the King had said nothing to either Counihan or <persName

                                summarized the portion of his July 13 conversation with the King
                                dealing with bases in telegram 84 from Rabat, July 14. The
                                Ambassador reported that the King had dropped his previous attempt
                                to hasten U.S. evacuation of the bases and was most interested in a
                                careful study of the possibilities of converting those bases to
                                Moroccan purposes. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                                also said that the Soviet technicians in Morocco had completed their
                                work and would depart soon, and that he believed an arrangement
                                could be reached under which the United States could maintain
                                communications facilities in Morocco. (Ibid.,
                                771.56311/7-1461)</note></p>
                        <p>During the conference with Captain Counihan, the King expressed his
                            personal and Morocco's regret at the Captain's departure and <pb n="183"
                                xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>inquired if the Captain was interested
                            in remaining in Morocco for a longer time. He said that he would like to
                            have the Captain serve as a special technical adviser to his Minister of
                            Interior and Chief of Royal Cabinet, M. Guedira, in matters pertaining
                            to the bases. He indicated he would amplify these instructions upon the
                            return of Captain Counihan to Morocco after his discussions with the
                            proper Washington officials. He then added that he recognized the
                            importance of the U.S. Navy communications facilities in Morocco to the
                            support of U.S. Navy forces in the Mediterranean and he, the King, felt
                            that a suitable arrangement could be made between the Government of
                            Morocco and the United States for their continued use after 1963. As to
                            the main Navy base in Kenitra, he expressed an opinion that after the
                            French withdrawal, the base could be converted to a Moroccan base in
                            which the U.S. Navy would remain as tenants and with an additional role
                            as instructor in maintenance and technical fields for the Moroccan Armed
                            Forces on that base. He thought that the Moroccan Navy (2 <gloss
                                target="#t_PC1">PC</gloss>s) could profit from U.S. Navy's
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>He then asked that Captain Counihan personally convey these sentiments in
                            a closely held manner to the responsible authorities in Washington.</p>
                        <p>This unique arrangement could present some problems. It will take the
                            nicest sense of judgment in the relationship between the U.S. Ambassador
                            and Commander, U.S. Naval Activities to successfully exploit this
                            unusual opportunity to influence Moroccan programs and policies
                            regarding the bases.</p>
                        <p>There is a possibility that an opportunity might even arise during this
                            period which could result in extension of tenure of certain U.S. Air
                            Force facilities on a joint basis with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Captain Counihan has been Commander, Naval Activities, Port Lyautey since
                            15 December 1957 and has built up an unusually friendly rapport, not
                            only with the King, but with the Moroccans in general in Rabat and
                            Kenitra. He was instrumental in providing extensive aid to the Moroccans
                            during the Agadir earthquake.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that without Captain Counihan working in this capacity,
                            we stand to lose not only the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases,
                            but all of our military facilities and therefore feel that if the State
                            Department will agree to letting Captain Counihan accept the King's
                            offer, we will be able to retain the approximately $100,000,000
                            communications facilities that the Navy uses to serve the Mediterranean
                            area.</p>

                                        sent a memorandum to Frederick G. Dutton at the White House
                                        concerning the King of Morocco's dissatisfaction with the
                                        lack of U.S. aid to the Moroccan Air Force, a subject in
                                        which the President had expressed an interest. It noted that

                                        fact that the possibility of Morocco receiving U.S. jets,
                                        which he had discussed with General Wade in January, had
                                        never materialized. The memorandum pointed out that the
                                        removal of Soviet personnel had clearly been a stipulation
                                        of any such offer, and that Ambassador <persName

                        <p>In your memorandum of 20 September 1961,<note n="1" xml:id="d121fn1"
                                >Secretary Zuckert's memorandum had argued that since there was
                                little or no possibility of effective use of U.S. bases in Morocco
                                after 1963, the only significant benefit to hope for was precluding
                                their future use by unfriendly forces. This meant that the United
                                States would be forced to rely more heavily on its Spanish bases and
                                thus any U.S. action in Morocco should not prejudice U.S. relations
                                with Spain. (Ibid.)</note> you recommended that any program of US
                            support for the Moroccan Air Force, involving under present
                            circumstances no guarantee of post-1963 <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> tenure in Morocco, should be carefully designed to
                            avoid prejudicing our relations with Spain and future tenure at our
                            Spanish bases.</p>
                        <p>In considering whether to recommend to the President that an assistance
                            program be undertaken, we have had this aspect of the matter uppermost
                            in mind. While we would hope that the program might later produce
                            Moroccan cooperation on any continuing <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> post-1963 requirements, we foresee no assurance of
                            this. The purpose of the program would be a calculated effort, albeit
                            without certainty, to preclude further Soviet penetration of the
                            Moroccan Air Force with equipment and technicians. Both the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff and the Air Force have emphasized the threat which such Soviet
                            penetration presents for our operations in Morocco and in Spain.</p>
                        <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>We agree that the impact of this program on US-Spanish relations is a
                            critical aspect of the problem. <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> has
                            now concurred in the program, because of the considered judgment, at the
                            highest levels of the State Department, that the proposed program would
                            not jeopardize our continued use of the Spanish bases after 1963
                            (although) we can anticipate increased Spanish demands for military
                            assistance).</p>
                        <p>The recommendation to the President will be that the program should be
                            kept to a minimum consistent with our aim of precluding further Soviet
                            support to the Moroccan Air Force. Initially, we would ascertain whether
                            the establishment of flying training facilities and provision of
                            aircraft to improve Morocco's air transport capability would suffice. If
                            it nevertheless appears necessary to provide jet fighters and training,
                            our offer would be limited to F-86s. Should the King of Morocco, despite
                            our best efforts, insist on an improved type of jet, a further
                            determination must then be made in Washington weighing all circumstances
                            at the time, whether to proceed with our offer of assistance. It is
                            clearly understood by all concerned that F-100s are not now available
                            due to the Berlin and other contingency planning.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> has placed heavy
                            emphasis on the need for a highly competent Air Force officer, fluent in
                            French and preferably of general officer rank, to discuss the program
                            with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> and senior
                            officers of the Moroccan Air Force. The success of evolving a program
                            satisfactory to the King, which also falls within limits acceptable to
                            us, could well rest on the influence this officer can bring to bear.
                            Accordingly, it is requested that an officer be carefully selected at
                            the earliest possible time to carry out this task, with the possibility
                            in mind that he may be called to Morocco in the early days of October.
                            It is impossible to predict the length of his stay there. However, we
                            should plan on his being available for this project for at least three
                            months.</p>
                        <p>As to a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> opinion, the Chiefs have
                            already given us a military judgment on the desirability of retaining
                            the Moroccan bases, and we are well aware of the importance they attach
                            to the Spanish bases. Since the crucial question is one of political
                            judgment—whether this offer to Morocco will jeopardize the Spanish
                            position—I do not think a further opinion by the Chiefs is required at
                            the present time.</p>

                                place at a joint State-Defense meeting on September 22. This
                                discussion was recorded in a memorandum of conversation that is
                                ibid., 771.5622/9-2261.</note> State and Defense have agreed on a
                            program designed to (a) preclude further Soviet air assistance to
                            Morocco; (b) establish a favorable climate to help ensure the Moroccans
                            live up to the base agreement until the end of 1963 and possibly extend
                            our use in some form beyond; and (c) generally insure a reasonably
                            favorable posture on the part of this highly strategic country.</p>
                        <p>The chief means to this end would be <hi rend="italic">to offer aid to
                                the Moroccan air force</hi>. As you know, Morocco accepted last year
                            two <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-15s and 12 <gloss
                                target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>-17s, along with technicians. The new
                            king has informally suggested to us that US aid for his air force would
                            be preferable to reliance on Moscow. He also has ideas about running a
                            training program for other African countries. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> recommends that we agree in
                            principle to provide such aid and send a survey team to see what the
                            Moroccans would settle for. He believes that Morocco should be asked to
                            put up a substantial portion of the cost. Our share cannot be costed for
                            these reasons, but could run to a total of $20-50 million over several
                            years.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Why aid to the air force</hi>? Giving Morocco advanced
                            US jets will create real problems elsewhere (see below). We are already
                            giving it on the order of $40-50 million in economic aid and $4 million
                            in military. Could we increase this instead? The trouble is that we want
                            to preclude a Soviet-supported air arm, and believe the King is
                            otherwise highly likely to continue to accept such Soviet aid. Moreover,
                            a US air mission, etc. in Morocco gives us a leg up on continued access
                            to the bases and facilities after 1963.</p>
                        <p>What kind of air force? State and the Ambassador believe that the
                            Moroccans may not settle for anything less than a squadron of Century
                            series fighters, i.e. F-100s. Giving F-100s to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> would at a minimum <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>generate Spanish demands for more
                            advanced types. Spain only has F-86s, although several squadrons of
                            them. We currently contemplate giving Spain one squadron of 104Gs in
                            1964-1965, but our base rights there too are up for renegotiation by
                            1963 and will probably generate larger Spanish demands. In any case no
                            F-100s are currently available because of our Berlin build-up, and
                            Defense would oppose F-100s because of the implication for many other
                            areas where we are resisting demands for advanced fighters, e.g.
                            Thailand. The compromise recommendation is that we try hard to sell the
                            Moroccans on F-86s, but if the survey team discovers the price is
                            higher, we'll re-examine our position.</p>
                        <p>Aid to the Moroccan air force is agreed by all concerned to be a gamble,
                            but State and Defense believe it one we should take. On the plus side
                            are the arguments that Morocco is itself highly important real estate
                            because of our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases, which the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> say will be needed through 1966.
                            We want to preclude a Soviet military presence so close to our Spanish
                            and Moroccan bases, and at the entrance to the Mediterranean. Navy and
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> communications facilities in
                            Morocco are also highly important, and <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss> is anxious to arrange for their continued use, perhaps
                            on a civilianized basis, after 1963. The proposed aid would help create
                            a favorable atmosphere for such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are so many uncertainties in this highly complex
                            and volatile situation that nobody can guarantee that US aid will ensure
                            any hold on these bases after 1963, or even until then. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has shown more staying power
                            than we thought he would last February when the old King died, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> thinks that he is a
                            good bet to stay in power, but the Leftist opposition is strong and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> may make a false step
                            at any time. Thus any promises made now by his regime may not be worth
                            much later on. Many other developments might take place which could so
                            upset US-Moroccan relations as to render any aid of limited bargaining
                            value. Morocco has designs not only on parts of Algeria and Mauritania
                            but on the remaining Spanish enclaves. Continued friction with Spain is
                            inevitable and fighting may break out. Our position in this event might
                            completely overshadow the positive gain from an accelerated aid program.
                            Moreover, developments in Algeria might also force Morocco to take an
                            anti-Western stand. In the endeavor to rid itself of Spanish enclaves
                            and remaining French bases, Morocco might find it necessary to put
                            pressure on us too.</p>
                        <p>So offering air force aid to Morocco would create serious problems with
                            Spain and even France. The Ambassador argues that Spain should realize
                            that a US-supported air force would be less of a threat to it than a
                            Soviet-supported one. However, the Spanish doubt that we would buy much
                            with a US air force and have no confidence in Hassan's regime.</p>
                        <p>Finally, can we be sure that US aid would in fact preclude acceptance of
                            further Soviet military aid? <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"

                                                aim of precluding further Soviet support of the
                                                Moroccan Air Force. We should first endeavor to
                                                ascertain whether the establishment of a flying
                                                training facility and provision of aircraft to
                                                improve Morocco's air transport capability would
                                                suffice. If it nevertheless appears necessary to
                                                provide jet fighters and training, we should limit
                                                our offer to F-86s. If the King of Morocco, despite
                                                our best efforts, insists on an improved type of jet
                                                we should at that point weigh carefully whether or
                                                not to proceed further with our offer. We should
                                                bear in mind, on the one hand, that an offer of
                                                Century Series aircraft would provoke demands from
                                                our allies and other unaligned nations for
                                                comparable assistance. However, we should, on the
                                                other hand, bear in mind that our failure, in these
                                                circumstances, to make available this type of
                                                aircraft would probably hasten Moroccan recourse to
                                                the Soviets, setting an example for other unaligned
                                                nations. In addition, although the King would

                        <p>On October 23, 1961, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"
                                >Bonsal</persName> met with King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan

                                >Bonsal</persName> conveyed a message from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> stating that if the King were
                            to come to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, he would be
                            pleased to meet with him in Washington. The King responded that he did
                            not plan to go to the United Nations this year but expressed interest in
                            the possibility of a State visit to Washington the following year. He
                            added that he planned to send <persName corresp="#p_BHA2"
                                >Balafrej</persName> as his personal representative to Washington in
                            late November to present a general explanation of Moroccan foreign
                            policy, and hoped he would be received by the President. (Telegram 644

                        <p>During the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName>
                            outlined the composition of the U.S. survey group that had been set up
                            to study and formulate recommendations on the conversion of U.S. bases
                            in Morocco to peaceful uses, and the King expressed his hope that the
                            team, with which he personally planned to meet for a working session,
                            would proceed to Morocco at an early date. (Telegram 645 from Rabat,
                            October 24; ibid.) The Ambassador conveyed <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>'s appreciation of Hassan's willingness to find a
                            formula that would permit continued U.S. use of the naval communications
                            facilities at Kenitra after 1963. The King reiterated his hope that this
                            could be worked out, but stipulated that he wanted it done by the two of
                            them on a very confidential basis. (Telegram 646 from Rabat, October 24;

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> said that the President had

                            with the King's expressed desire that this be changed, but had decided,
                            partly in view of previous U.S. commitments, that it could not be.

                        <p>On October 26, <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> reported
                            that he and <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> had not
                            discussed aid to the Moroccan air force, but that he had since learned
                            from <persName corresp="#p_BHA2">Balafrej</persName> that the King
                            continued to be interested in this subject and had been surprised that
                            he had not raised it. He had told the Foreign Minister that he would
                            welcome any information regarding Moroccan plans for developing its air
                            force, and stated that he had previously reported his discussion of this
                            subject with <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> in July to
                            Washington. <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> said he then
                            mentioned the problem of Soviet pilots and technicians without eliciting
                            any specific response. He believed that no further U.S. initiative was
                            necessary for the moment, but that the United States should be ready to
                            respond to any Moroccan initiatives. (Telegram 664 from Rabat, October

                                Attached to a memorandum from the Director of Foreign Military
                                Rights Affairs, William E. Lang, to William <persName

                                of Defense had undertaken to provide a memorandum on its specific
                                post-1963 communications requirements and the ways in which the
                                facilities in Morocco might be converted without jeopardizing the
                                military mission. Noting that the attached memorandum had been
                                cleared in Defense, Lang asked that it be forwarded to Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> as a basis for
                                discussion with the Moroccans concerning post-1963 communications
                                arrangements. <p>A copy of the memorandum was transmitted to

                                    771.56311/11-961) On December 5, the Ambassador responded that
                                    it was clear from the record of all previous conversations with
                                    the King that he assumed that continued operation of the
                                    communications sites after 1963 would be predicated upon
                                    generous U.S. assistance. Thus, the Embassy was convinced that
                                    any proposal to <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                                    should be in the form of a comprehensive package covering in

                            FACILITIES IN MOROCCO AFTER 1963</p>
                        <p>There is a need for the continued operation after 1963 of the present
                            U.S. Navy communications facilities at Bouknadel and Sidi Yahia. In
                            addition there is a need for continued operation of certain very limited
                            U.S. Air Force communications facilities at and near the Sidi Slimane
                            air base. The latter specifically include the communications center at
                            Sidi Slimane air base, the receiver site about sixteen miles west of the
                            air base and the transmitter site about ten miles east of the air
                            base.</p>
                        <p>The most effective use of the U.S. Navy communications facilities at
                            Bouknadel and Sidi Yahia would require certain support facilities not
                            available at the sites themselves (for example, some administrative,
                            housing, medical, and commissary facilities, and the limited use of air
                            transport facilities). The most practicable solution for these support
                            needs would appear to be some arrangement, satisfactory to both
                            Governments, under which continued use could be made of certain
                            facilities at the Kenitra naval air station which already serve to
                            support the communications sites.</p>
                        <p>The Air Force facilities at and near Sidi Slimane could be operated after
                            1963 by approximately thirty-five civilian employees of a U.S. civilian
                            contractor. Operation of the sites at Bouknadel and Sidi Yahia would
                            require approximately their current personnel strength, but we would
                            propose to make maximum practicable use of Moroccan personnel in order
                            to reduce the total number of U.S. naval personnel involved. The naval
                            personnel would wear civilian clothing at all times.</p>

                        <p>As King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> was advised during
                            his first visit to Washington as Crown Prince in October 1960, the
                            communications facilities encompassed by the United States proposal are
                            important elements in the world-wide communications system of the United
                            States forces. As such, they are important in the defense of the Western
                            world, including North Africa, against potential Communist aggression.
                            It was also confirmed to the Crown Prince that the function of the
                            facilities would be to provide relay points for the transmission of
                            administrative and operational messages.</p>

                            emphasized Morocco's non-alignment, desire strengthen its long standing

                        <p>In addition foregoing more important specific points were as follows:</p>

                            particularly Mali cause concern and suggested Morocco well placed to
                            steer these countries into more independent non-alignment. President
                            expressed wish meet King sometime soon and said had discussed with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> possibility of
                            an early visit of King to US.</p>
                        <p>Secretary emphasized our concern Morocco may be entering into new
                            association with Soviets in direct and sensitive field of military
                            aviation. Pointed out this would be difficult to explain to US people
                            particularly at time when US and Morocco moving together toward
                            regularizing our special situation in Morocco, i.e, bases. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA2">Balafrej</persName> countered by saying in view
                            Morocco policy non-alignment a military alliance or accord with Soviets
                            out of question as would be such an alliance with US. Said, however, it
                            unthinkable Moroccan relations with US should be affected by a choice
                            Morocco might make of a source from which to receive arms it needed.
                            Continued with allusions to difficulties which US allies have caused
                            Morocco and other newly independent or emerging countries (Algeria).
                            Dwelt on cooperation US had offered and Morocco's gratitude for it.

                            under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> emphasized to

                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum is to inform you of at least a tactical modification
                            which seems required in the policy you approved last September of
                            offering aid to Moroccan air force. This program was to be predicated
                            upon “satisfactory private assurances” that no further Bloc air aid
                            would be accepted. If these assurances were not forthcoming, the policy
                            was to be reviewed.</p>
                        <p>Since then Morocco has become more immediately interested in transports
                            than in the jet fighters we were afraid we might have to give. Moreover,
                            the Soviets have made a new aid offer (perhaps including planes) and the
                            Moroccan Defense Minister went to Moscow to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>State is therefore anxious to move quickly by sending an Air Force
                            colonel to survey Moroccan needs. While <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"
                                >Bonsal</persName> has not yet been able to get to King (who is
                            obviously stalling), he and State feel that we should take this next
                            step on basis of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BHA2"
                                >Balafrej</persName>'s statement that Moroccans will make no
                            arrangements involving Soviet technicians in Morocco and that King's
                            interest is mainly in Soviet small arms. French were given similar
                            assurances. State argues that even though Moroccans are obviously
                            blackmailing us, it is tactically unwise now to insist on more formal
                            guarantees. They point out that we could get additional assurances later
                            on before making a final offer.</p>
                        <p>Defense will go along (it plans to send the colonel to Rabat this
                            weekend), but is worried that in doing so we are in effect taking one
                            more step down the road without yet getting firm preclusive guarantees
                            the policy calls for. <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> is
                            concerned because the C-119s Moroccans want will have to come out of our
                            own inventory, and over Spanish objections (French seem to have come
                            around to our view that if we don't help Morocco, Soviets will).</p>
                        <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"/>
                        <p>I feel that we should go along with State. Although we do not yet have
                            the words from King we want, our overall interest is preclusion in fact,
                            not in words. All recognize that this exercise is a gamble, and that it
                            is how forthcoming we are on aid which will in fact determine whether
                            King keeps Soviets out. While I too think we need and should try for
                            more “satisfactory assurances,” we should allow State leeway as to how
                            and when these can best be obtained.</p>

                                    >NSAM</gloss> No. 102, even though the US has not yet received

                                Bloc air force aid would be accepted. While recognizing that our
                                chief objective is such preclusion itself and that we must be

                        <p>Net effect will probably harden both State and Defense positions, and

                            and rely on our aid itself to preclude Moroccans taking too much from
                            Soviets. The fact is that we're competing with the Sovs, and whether

                            the United States considered its previous assistance poorly rewarded by
                            Morocco's recourse to significant Soviet military aid, but warned that
                            this would be poorly received since the King presumably regarded such
                            assistance as having been to a large extent a reward for maintaining
                            important U.S. base facilities on Moroccan territory. <persName

                            other governments. (Telegram 1376 from Rabat; Department of State,

                        <p>The Department of State's response noted that the nature as well as the
                            timing of his approach to the King regarding the U.S. reaction to
                            Moroccan acceptance of further Soviet military equipment had been left
                            to the Ambassador's judgment. Although the Department appreciated the
                            complexities of such an approach, it seemed indispensable to further
                            determine the most effective means of achieving essential U.S. aims.

                            “so far as possible” to Western sources for such materiel, and indicated
                            that the pending acquisitions from the Soviets consisted of light arms.
                            However, he specifically stated that he did not feel able to give any
                            binding assurances on these matters because he required freedom of
                            action to meet Morocco's needs. (Telegram 1432 from Rabat, February 22;

                        <p>The Ambassador also apologized to the King for the delay in receiving the
                            conclusions of the U.S. base survey team, but noted that he had been
                            increasingly impressed with the complexity of the problem of base
                            conversion with minimum shock to the Moroccan economy. (Telegram 1434

                        <p>On March 7, the Head of the Moroccan Base Survey Team, William O. Baxter,

                        </list>
                        <p>In my opinion the time has come to extend to King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan II</persName> of Morocco, who has
                            repeatedly and pointedly made clear his desire to meet you, a formal
                            invitation to visit the United States. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> is strongly of the opinion that
                            an invitation has become an essential factor in ensuring the King's
                            continued benevolence toward our military requirements. The Ambassador
                            has already felt it necessary to tell the King that a visit here is
                            under active consideration. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] it will be necessary to offer him a State
                            Visit.</p>
                        <p>I do not lightly recommend such a visit. The King's [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] rule is
                            challenged with increasing vigor at home and he has pursued [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            policy abroad, keeping a foot in both Eastern and Western camps. He
                            continues to accept Soviet arms (e.g., forty medium tanks may be the
                            latest item involved). [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I think an invitation is dictated by our military interests
                            and the strategic importance of Morocco's geographic position.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName>'s considered
                            estimate is that the King's rule is secure for at least the next few
                            years, the critical period in our base operations. It is something of a
                            political miracle that our <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bombers
                            can continue to use Moroccan bases and we would want nothing to
                            interfere with the tenure which has been promised us until the end of
                            1963. Moreover, the Department of Defense would like if possible to
                            retain certain military facilities after 1963. Even without these
                            considerations, we could not view with equanimity a substantial Soviet
                            foothold in this vulnerable corner of the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>To be of maximum political effectiveness in our current discussions with
                            the King over military aid and base reconversion, the invitation should
                            be extended as soon as possible, even if the visit itself should be
                            scheduled for some months hence. While a long lead-time might well allow
                            the King the opportunity to do things in the interval which could be
                            embarrassing to us, the Ambassador argues that the prospect of a visit
                            to Washington is more likely to have a stabilizing effect on him. On
                            balance, <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"/>therefore, I recommend
                            extending now an invitation for a State Visit early next year at a time
                            to be mutually agreed upon later, inasmuch as practical problems and
                            commitments prevent a visit in the latter part of this year.<note n="1"

                        <p>I concur that “Navy package” need not be offered at initial stage of

                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> has told <persName

                            but “hoped to give preference as far as possible” to Western sources for
                            materiel requiring foreign instructors and technicians. The Foreign
                            Minister went further in telling <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"
                                >Bonsal</persName> March 23rd that “he was now in a position to
                            state that there would be no Soviet instructors and technicians” in
                            Morocco. The Moroccans so far have resisted reported new Soviet air aid
                            offers, although they just bought $3-4 million in Soviet tanks and
                            artillery to accompany a Soviet gift of lighter equipment for their
                            ground forces.</p>
                        <p>I join State and Defense in urging that we go ahead on this basis. The
                            Moroccan situation is a highly competitive one. The Soviets have pressed
                            consistently since 1956 to increase their influence. Hassan's early 1961
                            acceptance of 14 <gloss target="#t_MIG1">MIG</gloss>s [less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified] gave them an opening wedge which they
                            have been trying to widen ever since.</p>
                        <p>So <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> will simply turn to the
                            Bloc if he doesn't get what he wants from the West. We can't stop him
                            from accepting some Soviet aid to satisfy his domestic leftist
                            opposition and the African neutrals. He's also determined to build up
                            his armed forces—with or without US help. But by meeting certain
                            reasonable demands we can stimulate his apparent desire to avoid getting
                            in over his head with the Communists. Moreover, we can achieve
                            “preclusion” in fact if we saturate his fledgling air force's absorptive
                            capacity, which is what proposed transport package tries to do.</p>

                            Department of State immediately instructed the Ambassador not to make
                            the approach authorized in telegram 1571 (see <ref target="#d134fn1"
                                >footnote 1, Document 134</ref>) until he had ascertained that the
                            Soviet shipments did not include aircraft. (Telegram 1570, April 9;

                            he had denied “categorically” that either aircraft or helicopters had
                            constituted part of the arrivals of Soviet military equipment. (Telegram

                        <p>On April 13, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName>
                            discussed the recent arrival of Soviet arms with King Hassan, who told
                            him that the Soviet shipment had contained helicopters being acquired by
                            the Provisional Algerian Government for publicity uses in connection
                            with the forthcoming plebiscite in Algeria. He added that his government
                            had just been informed of the imminent arrival of three Soviet
                            technicians to assemble the helicopters, and complained that he had been
                            put in an embarrassing position. <persName corresp="#p_BPW2"
                                >Bonsal</persName> had commented that the King would have a good
                            basis for refusing to receive the technicians, to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> had replied that the matter was
                            under study. The Ambassador also asked if he could be furnished with
                            further information on what was being received. The King said that he
                            did not think this was possible, but stressed that the materiel received
                            belonged in the category of “light armament” which would require the
                            presence of no Soviet technicians or instructors. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BPW2">Bonsal</persName> reported that Hassan, who had
                            been most cordial and had expressed his desire to continue cooperative
                            relations with the United States, had reiterated his preference for U.S.
                            planes, communications equipment, and naval vessels. (Telegram 1786 from

                        <p>1660. As you are aware, decision to provide major military aviation
                            package for King of Morocco was extremely distasteful one to make, and
                            has always been considered at best as gamble which had to be taken to
                            try to limit to extent possible further Soviet involvement with Moroccan
                            armed forces especially aviation.</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>While we have now completed all necessary paperwork here to be in
                            position to move rapidly as soon as agreement reached by you with King,
                            it also follows that if for any reason we should conclude either that
                            such action would fail in its purpose of preclusion, or that even
                            without it King might be induced to reduce his dependence on Soviets, we
                            should not hesitate to withdraw or hold back for time our air transport
                            offer.</p>
                        <p>Arrival of substantial Soviet arms shipments is most unfortunate
                            coincidence, even if King's [less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified] explanation on helicopters is accepted at face value. This
                            situation will certainly cause adverse public and congressional
                            reaction, and raises certain questions in our mind. We wonder in this
                            respect whether King himself might not have reason be genuinely
                            concerned at our probable reaction, and whether in fact it might not be
                            salutary to encourage such concern on his part. [1-1/2 lines of source
                            text not declassified] do you think that King would really be ready to
                            sever his heretofore fruitful relationships with us and open floodgates
                            to Soviets? Do you think even Soviets would be disposed, against strong
                            Opposition objections and at eventual risk of alienating Algerians, to
                            continue to embrace and fortify “reactionary” Moroccan monarchy? Do you
                            think that failure at this point to proceed with air transport offer
                            would seriously jeopardize our base tenure through 1963 or possibilities
                            of acquiring post-1963 communications rights?</p>
                        <p>We are not persuaded that because King has learned we about to make air
                            transport offer we are irretrievably committed to go through with it.
                            Furthermore, is it wise to cut short opposition criticism of King over
                            present Soviet arms shipments by giving public demonstration his tactic
                            of manipulation both sides is highly successful?</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, we believe that King's uneasiness over our reaction to his
                            moves has made it desirable that you make approach to him along
                            following lines (leaving to your discretion whether more effective cover

                                statements should clear any misunderstanding that might have arisen
                                regarding Soviet arms and helicopters, and would not accept the idea
                                that U.S. or French military aid should involve assurances on his

                                the Soviets. The Ambassador noted that in Morocco the United States
                                was faced with strong and ruthless competition in the arms field.

                        <p>I opened conversation by referring to statement King had made on April 13
                            which I had conveyed to Washington (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1"
                                >Embtel</gloss> 1786 repeated Paris 457 and Madrid 202).<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d137fn3">See <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note>
                            I asked whether King had any further information which he wished to
                            convey on Soviet arms or on helicopters. He replied in negative. In
                            answer to my questions he said that “light arms” being received from
                            Soviets (deliveries not yet completed) include tanks and artillery but
                            will not require presence here of Soviet technicians or instructors and
                            will not involve Moroccan training groups in Soviet Union. King is in no
                            doubt our concern regarding these Soviet activities here but he finds
                            difficult understand such concern in view his statements. He reiterated
                            that preference and hence policy of <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            will be to continue obtaining, to extent possible, arms requiring
                            technicians and instructors from West.</p>
                        <p>I then described our air transport program. Starting from point that
                            survey and recommendations now approved by President designed fully meet
                            Moroccan requirements as set forth last December, I described program in
                            terms of (A) two and one half year period, (B) immediate shipment of 3
                            C-119's and 3 C-47's, (C) presence here of about 80 US instructors and
                            technicians for maintenance and instruction and (D) our understanding
                            that King would wish consider as purchase rather than gift and would
                            accept terms similar those involved in ground forces package. I told him
                            total value package about $15 million and that we would expect collect
                            about 10 percent over 5-year period.</p>
                        <p>King expressed general satisfaction but stressed, as he has done before,
                            his regret that earlier attempts to achieve cooperation between US and
                            Morocco in military aviation field had been frustrated. He referred
                            especially to episode involving General Wade early last year. He agreed
                            with me that details of package could now be negotiated at military
                            level between representatives of two governments.</p>
                        <p>I told King as emphatically as possible that in making available this
                            package our understanding is that we are meeting complete <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> requirements in this field and would
                            not be confronted with competition from any other sources. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA2">Balafrej</persName> interjected to say that what
                            was involved was “amitie exclusive” (exclusive friendship). After some
                            discussion <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0238"/>King said that
                            obviously <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss> has no intention of
                            seeking assistance in this field from any other source. (He did not
                            raise question of command plane nor did I. This however is weak point
                            our position which will come up in military level discussions and on
                            which I regret we are not in position make constructive suggestion
                            particularly as we wish avoid undesirable source for this
                            requirement.)</p>
                        <p>I then raised question of third tranche of ground forces package and told
                            King that President has approved ammunition increment requested by
                            Moroccan military and that we are ready to go ahead as soon as necessary
                            formalities at military level can be completed. He expressed
                            appreciation. I raised, in this connection, our willingness accept
                            Moroccan officers in US training schools and recalled that I had
                            mentioned this to King when I saw him in February. He confirmed his
                            interest in this possibility and said that he believed that by next
                            October current reorganization of training concepts in Moroccan army
                            would permit some of his officers to proceed to US (<gloss

                        <p>In view of above we are proceeding to approach Moroccan Minister of

                                xml:id="d137fn5">At the conclusion of the conversation, the

                                he was ready to discuss with him a proposal under which the
                                Government of Morocco might permit the United States to retain use
                                of the Kenitra communications facilities after the end of 1963. The
                                King replied that he was still full of “goodwill” on this subject,
                                but would like to have the U.S. proposal submitted first to his
                                Foreign Minister for careful study and examination. (Telegram 1916

                                subject as above.<note n="1" xml:id="d138fn1">The memorandum asked
                                    whether U.S. post-1963 needs could be met through small

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed their previously expressed
                                views on the above subject and have concluded that, in the interest
                                of US security, the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases in
                                Morocco are highly important because of their role in the US
                                strategic deterrent posture and their use for contingencies in
                                Africa and the Middle East as well as their denial to third powers.
                                Hence their post-1963 retention in operational configuration remains
                                a valid military requirement. It is the view of the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff that this requirement cannot be met through small maintenance
                                elements on bases to which we would have only re-entry rights.

                            aid.</p>
                        <p>Since you approved our helping <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> build his air transport force last April, we have
                            delivered the first tranche of equipment and have begun training. The
                            Moroccans appear quite pleased, and we've been successful so far in
                            precluding further Soviet air force activity. However, the Moroccans
                            have bought about 20 Soviet tanks and other army equipment with a few
                            technicians. Some helicopters have arrived too, but the Moroccans claim
                            these are destined for Algeria.</p>
                        <p>The chief outstanding issues now are the status of the Navy
                            communications facility at Kenitra, our three <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> bases—and the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 aid
                            level. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> came up recently with
                            another plea that we try to hold on to the <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> bases past end-1963. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> has in fact rejected this, and Ferguson has
                            been clued. All <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will go

                            Nouasseur, unless we can get more free. However, he is not putting this
                            in writing because he's not anxious to challenge the Chiefs frontally on
                            it, while he still has the B-70 argument on his hands.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has also approved pressing for
                            arrangements to maintain the Kenitra base, its two outlying transmitter
                            sites, and a <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> communications
                            facility. We have an urgent need for these facilities. In return <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is willing to train Moroccans in naval
                            operations at Kenitra and to contribute $5 million in naval hardware.
                            Our initial approach to King <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> on 16 July, however, (which involved keeping
                            there 2200 US personnel, 1300 less than present strength) met with some
                            fudging. <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> “accepted in
                            principle” that some formula would be found but said he did not wish to
                            decide or discuss details until his meeting with you next March.</p>
                        <p>Because the Navy has to decide finally by then whether to build alternate
                            facilities, we'd rather have Ferguson re-open the dialogue now, while
                            recognizing that we probably won't be able to close the deal until
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> comes here. To arm
                            Ferguson for this effort, we suggest you give him attached letter2
                            introducing him as your personal spokesman.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations on the bases will soon get mixed up with the question of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 aid level (summary of recent
                            levels attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Not attached to the source
                                text.</note><gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is planning $20
                            million in supporting assistance (down from $30 million last year) plus
                            $5-8 million in loans from <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 Title I
                            sales and a $1.6 million development grant for technical assistance.
                            (Title II and III programs are estimated at $30 million total, but the
                            Moroccans don't include this in their definition of the aid level.)
                            Because the Embassy believes the aid level must be at least $40 million
                            for us to keep our base rights, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is
                            also allowing $12-15 million in development loans. The hitch is that we
                            probably won't find enough sound projects to absorb that much
                            development lending, so the pressure will be on to increase supporting
                            assistance. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> wants to hold this line
                            at $20 million this year to press the shift from supporting assistance
                            to development loans, but we will clearly have a major sore point unless
                            we find suitable projects.</p>
                        <p>A minor issue bearing on the base and aid level talks is Hassan's
                            interest in building a shipyard at Tangier. He thinks this would help
                            pull the economy of Northern Morocco out of the doldrums, and his
                            lieutenants hint that the Soviets have offered $30 million for the
                            project. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> says the project would be
                            an economic flop because the world shipb ding capacity is already
                            excess. We believe we should not respond [less than 1 line of source
                            text not declassified] on this one, because so far we don't see the
                            Soviets gaining any significant military advantage from it. However, the
                            Moroccans may inject this into our negotiations.</p>

                        <p>All in all, we'll have to continue to pay handsomely if we want both to
                            make a stab at keeping certain base rights and to compete effectively

                            that the political difficulties of negotiating an extension of our
                            present use of the bases in Morocco beyond 1963, when we are committed
                            to withdraw, and the high political or economic price that would be
                            demanded for such an extension make it advisable to negotiate for the
                            retention after 1963 of U.S. maintenance elements only. Our objectives
                            in such negotiations will be to preclude Soviet use or occupancy of the
                            bases and to permit their occasional use for transit and their
                            availability for post-strike recovery operations. Accordingly, I have
                            sent the attached letter to the Department of State.<note n="1"

                                Moroccan permission, in times of emergency. To this end, the United

                                after 1963, but their size and nature would depend on the uses to
                                which the Moroccans put the bases and the forms of U.S. assistance.
                                Therefore, it must be determined soon what use would be made of the
                                bases by Morocco after 1963. (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"

                        <p>I have seen the discussion paper of August 6, 1962, prepared by the Chief
                            of Staff of the Air Force concerning the personnel and cost requirements
                            for the maintenance elements at the bases after 1963. In my judgment,
                            the total number of personnel at the three bases should not exceed 500,
                            and the Air Force should proceed in its planning on this basis.</p>

                                    >footnote 1, Document 140</ref>.</note> I outlined our post-1963
                            objectives for the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases in Morocco.
                            The last paragraph of my letter took into account that <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> had conducted a survey, the results of
                            which were given to the Moroccan Government, concerning possible
                            Moroccan use of the bases after 1963.</p>
                        <p>After careful study, the Secretary of the Air Force has concluded that to
                            maintain any military usefulness along the lines proposed in my letter
                            would be inordinately costly in money and personnel, and would have
                            little prospect of success, if integral elements of the bases at Sidi
                            Slimane and Ben Guerir were converted to Moroccan use. The problems of
                            guarding the equipment against theft and the costs of operating
                            utilities and other support facilities would probably be out of
                            proportion to any potential military benefits.</p>
                        <p>Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir have little, if any, true economic potential
                            for the Moroccans. We know, however, that they are extremely interested
                            in the development of Nouasseur as a civilian airport servicing
                            Casablanca. Accordingly, I propose that in our discussions with the
                            Moroccans we focus on the conversion of Nouasseur into a civil airport,
                            and our willingness to assist Morocco in this regard, and also seek to
                                <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0244"/>work out arrangements under
                            which Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir will be retained by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> in a standby or “mothball”
                            status.</p>
                        <p>If you agree with this course, I suggest that appropriate guidance be
                            given to Ambassador Ferguson for his use in talks with the Moroccan
                            authorities prior to the visit of King Moulay <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> with the President. In the
                            interim, I propose that representatives of our respective departments
                            get together at an early date with other interested agencies, such as
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FAA1"
                                >FAA</gloss>, and study how best we could assist the Moroccans in
                            developing Nouasseur for civil use within the means available to our
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>On 7 January 1963 a meeting was held with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW3"
                                >Witman</persName> and others at State to discuss the import of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>'s letter to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> of 26 December. Major
                            General Wade outlined what the Air Force had in mind when it referred to
                            retaining the bases at Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir in a “mothball or
                            standby” status. General Wade mentioned 5 purposes: (1) preclusion; (2)
                            support for contingency operations (including the prompt pre-strike
                            stationing of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bombers); (3) <gloss
                                target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> operations; (4) fair weather training
                            for forces stationed in Europe; and (5) post-strike recovery.</p>
                        <p>Sidi would be manned by 300 AF personnel, and Ben Guerir would be manned
                            by 200 AF personnel, with no more than a total of 1,000 dependents at
                            both bases residing in the guaranteed rental housing <pb n="217"
                                xml:id="pg_217" facs="0245"/>which exists at both bases. The bases
                            would be maintained in a status which would permit their use as
                            emergency weather alternates for the Spanish bases, and for <gloss
                                target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> landings.</p>
                        <p>To carry out this proposal for the 2 bases would not require the return
                            of equipment already removed under the existing phaseout plan. Only
                            excess equipment has been removed to date.</p>
                        <p>Initially the Air Force does not envisage a great use of the facilities,
                            but it would increase this use from time to time to see “how much the
                            traffic would bear.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW3">Witman</persName> noted that excluding any
                            Moroccan activity at the bases posed two problems: 1) such an
                            arrangement would not provide the economic benefits which the Moroccans
                            were led to expect from the Baxter report; and 2) more importantly, it
                            would be more difficult for <persName corresp="#p_HII1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to provide a gimmick to justify domestically a
                            continued US presence at the bases.</p>
                        <p>He also noted that the Air Force's proposal probably would generate
                            Moroccan expectations for greater economic assistance than we presently
                            envisage. We have just informed the <gloss target="#t_GOM1">GOM</gloss>
                            that $20 million in support assistance has been programmed for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63. The present projection for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 is $10 million and for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65 zero.</p>
                        <p>While the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> will soon visit Nouasseur
                            to see what is required to make that a civilian airport, <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            will check in this country to determine what is needed for such an
                            airport, what is available at that base presently, and what will have to
                            be funded by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. The Moroccans have
                            suggested that Pan Am be allowed to use Nouasseur as early as this
                            coming April. General Wade indicated that this would not interfere with
                            our present function there, and many thought that this would allow the
                            American carrier to obtain an advantage over its foreign competitors and
                            thus assure an adequate American presence there.</p>
                        <p>In summing up Bill <persName corresp="#p_WW3">Witman</persName> noted
                            that we had three significant projects in Morocco: Voice of America
                            facilities; Naval communications at Kenitra; and the Air Force bases. In
                            view of Hassan's forthcoming visit to the US and the Moroccans' refusal
                            to undertake meaningful discussions on the issue of post-1963 US
                            presence at these facilities until the King's visit, we should endeavor
                            to establish, before then, an order of priority among these three
                            undertakings and to arrive at some estimate of the price, both economic
                            and political, which we are willing to pay for each one.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In your consideration of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 and
                            future year aid levels for Morocco in connection with the King's visit
                            at the end of the month, it might be useful for you to have my views on
                            the importance of the military facilities in Morocco as an element of
                            our foreign policy posture in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>The importance of the Sixth Fleet in our diplomatic efforts and our
                            military stance in this area is well recognized. Command and control of
                            the Sixth Fleet is exercised through the facilities at Kenitra which
                            handle a major portion of the Navy's requirements in the Western
                            Mediterranean and the Atlantic approaches. Kenitra serves as a vital
                            link in the communications chain from the U.S. through Asmara, Ethiopia
                                [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                            There are no practical alternative sites for the Navy communications and
                            security facilities. To relocate this complex would require a two year
                            construction program which we understand would cost $25 million. Loss of
                            these facilities would lower significantly the Navy's operational
                            capability in this area.</p>
                        <p>While the Air Force requirements at Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir are
                            somewhat less critical from a military point of view, and we don't
                            anticipate any real difficulty in negotiating the retention of these
                            bases on a standby basis, it is important that these airfields not
                            become available to unfriendly forces. The presence of any hostile force
                            on the southern flank would create serious military problems. There are,
                            of course, added advantages for <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> to
                            retain these two bases for such purposes as training, transport and
                            emergency uses. The phase-out of the B-47 <gloss target="#t_SAC1"
                                >SAC</gloss> Reflex operation in 1963 does not completely reduce the
                            value to us of these installations.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate fully that you must weigh many factors in developing a sound
                            aid program for Morocco.</p>

                        <p>Here are some key questions on which you'll want to be satisfied at your
                            10:00 a.m. Tuesday briefing session on Hassan's visit:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Is our aid package adequate to get us the residual base
                                rights we want?</hi> Ambassador Ferguson argues that it is an
                            absolute minimum, and Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> will have further increases up his sleeve. Dave
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> will strongly
                            oppose.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">If <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                                rejects our offer, should we go higher?</hi> My own sense is that we
                            can and should hold the presently agreed line. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> needs us as much as we need him,
                            Kenitra is not worth more than we're offering, and we've got to get the
                            Moroccans to use our aid effectively instead of relying on a dole from
                            us. We'd also have a hard time selling Congress on giving more aid than
                            before pulling <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> out. In the last
                            analysis the only reason to raise our offer would be if Defense can make
                            an airtight case that Kenitra is worth it and is willing to pay.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Can the Moroccans come up with enough project loans to
                                fulfill our proposed commitment?</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> knows his government will
                            have trouble coming up with good projects so will resist our proposal to
                            substitute <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss>. You'll want to be sure <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> will make a major effort to help them. Otherwise we'll
                            be wide open to Moroccan charges of backing out on our agreement, if
                            they don't come through with a few decent loan applications.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Should we give Morocco any new military aid?</hi> We
                            have numerous reports that <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            will be asking for everything from F-100s to training for a couple of
                            hundred men. We plan on $5 million naval package as partial rent for
                            Kenitra, but aren't enthusiastic about giving any sophisticated
                            hardware. You might probe how far <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            sees sense in going.</p>
                        <p>We've simply been unable to smoke out the King's ideas in advance, so may
                            have to make some quick fixes during the visit or settle for vague
                            agreements in principle which can be pinned down later. Trouble with the
                            latter is that <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName> may again
                            prove elusive, and if we're going to move Kenitra to Spain we've got to
                            start soon.</p>

                        <p>The President was satisfied in general with the proposed US aid package
                            designed to assure retention of base rights at least at Kenitra, though
                            he was aware that there might be great Moroccan pressure for more than
                            we were prepared to offer.</p>
                        <p>He also approved the proposed tactics for the visit: (1) during first
                            meeting he would give King <persName corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan</persName>
                            the broad brush treatment on world and African affairs and then discuss
                            our base requirements, mentioning our willingness to give a $5 million
                            navy <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> package in return for Kenitra;
                            (2) <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would then make a general
                            aid offer at his meeting the next morning, sticking with the agreed
                            initial position; (3) if the King reacted with shock as expected, the
                            President would then reveal our fallback position in his second meeting
                            with the King Thursday afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The President asked several questions. He wanted to know why we shouldn't
                            give jet fighters to the Moroccans. Ambassador Ferguson didn't think
                            they'd ask for these, but would ask for considerable training. Bill
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> thought we could give
                            training, but not in jet fighters. Upon the President's query, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> described the key importance to the navy of the
                            communications installation at Kenitra. The President couldn't see much
                            use in standby rights at two of the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                            bases. It was explained that these were possible transit alternates to
                            the Azores and Wheelus and that we might have some “emergency” use for
                            them, although this was dubious. It was also brought out that Kenitra in
                            particular, but also the <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases, gave
                            us certain leverage in the Spanish base negotiations.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion of the price we should pay for
                            continued use of bases. <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                            and Ferguson pointed out that the King thought he was taking new risks
                            in allowing us to stay longer than specified in the agreement between
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and Mohammed V;
                            therefore he might want a lot of aid.</p>

                        <p>In reply to the President's query Bill <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >Bundy</persName> indicated that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            was prepared to pick up the tab on bases in general if it were legally
                            feasible, but that Congress was very reluctant to do so. Senator
                            Saltonstall, for example, had objected to the procedure used in the
                            Libyan case. The President also asked how long we want to stay in
                            Kenitra. We would prefer to stay for five years but could live with two
                            years; it was agreed we would not try to tape down a specific time of
                            stay, but would attempt to keep it open-ended beyond two years.<note

                        <p>Ambassador Ferguson emphasized that the King would probably press for an
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63 aid which wasn't
                            specified in our package (Morocco was cut from $30 million <gloss

                            opportunity to make a counter-proposal to our aid package, because this
                            would inevitably be considerably higher than we could afford.</p>

                        <p>The President brought up the subject of the American bases. He mentioned
                            that the U.S. is prepared to withdraw from the three air bases, <pb
                                n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0253"/>as this had undoubtedly been
                            communicated to His Majesty by the American Ambassador. We would desire,
                            however, to keep the telecommunications facilities of the Naval base at
                            Kenitra. What are the King's ideas on the subject?</p>
                        <p>The King asked what were the President's proposals.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we attached a considerable amount of importance
                            to the telecommunications base at Kenitra, as there are no other
                            facilities easily available in that part of the world, and as the
                            installation had been quite costly. There might be a possibility to
                            remove the facilities to Spain, but this would take time and call for
                            special negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The King said that when he came to the United States in 1960 as head of
                            the Moroccan Delegation to the United Nations, he spent a full day at
                            the Pentagon where he was thoroughly briefed by representatives of
                            American Naval aviation. He was shown also films about the Kenitra
                            facilities and he fully realizes their importance. At the same time,
                            however, an agreement had been reached between the United States
                            Government and his late Majesty, the King's father, which provided for
                            withdrawal from the bases at the end of 1963. This has a great
                            importance in the eyes of Moroccan public opinion and the King would not
                            wish to appear in any way to have broken an item of his father's will.
                            This is the problem to which a solution needs to be found.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that our withdrawal from the three air bases would
                            amount to carrying out the agreement mentioned by the King. As for the
                            Naval facility, some arrangements might be found—for example, in the
                            area of command—which would make American presence at that base less
                            conspicuous, but which would allow us to continue using the facilities
                            for a period of time, until they could be phased out.</p>
                        <p>The King asked for how long would the U.S. wish to keep its
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>The President said for as long as the Moroccans would have us.</p>
                        <p>The King asked what would be the minimum.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that five years might be the minimum. The
                            President further said that an arrangement as to the command structure
                            of the bases might be sought in connection with some economic programs
                            and also with some help to the Moroccan Navy which, although not
                            necessarily directly tied to the Kenitra base, would nevertheless be to
                            the advantage of that Navy.</p>
                        <p>The King said that while he understood the interest of the United States
                            in that question, what is important in fact are the telecommunications
                            facilities, which are needed by the United States to cover the Atlantic
                            and even part of the Pacific. Under those circumstances, it would be
                            useful to seek some sort of arrangement, if this were to prove
                            possible.</p>
                        <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0254"/>
                        <p>The President said that the King would be seeing the Secretary of State
                            the next day. It is possible that details could be discussed between the
                            Moroccan Ministers and the Secretaries and then be brought up again
                            before the King and the President in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The King asked whether he was going to see Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. According to his schedule,
                            he was to receive the call of the Air Force Secretary, Mr. Zuckert.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName>, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, was in the
                            next room and that he was the person from Defense who would be
                            discussing those questions with the Moroccans.</p>
                        <p>The King said that in this case conversations could take place between
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA2">Balafrej</persName> on the one hand, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. Ahardane on
                            the other. It would be exceedingly important to keep those conversations
                            secret and for that reason the two negotiating delegations must be kept
                            down in numbers to the strict minimum. These conversations could take
                            place the next day. After that, the King might perhaps give up his trip
                            to Annapolis which had been programmed, and instead make another call on
                            the President to conclude the negotiations carried out by the
                            ministers.</p>
                        <p>The King wanted to make clear the reasons which led him to this proposal.
                            Since the beginning of his reign, it has always been his policy to be
                            clear, explicit and frank in his relations with the Moroccan people. Any
                            decision arrived at in regard to the bases would have to be placed in a
                            communique. It is extremely important that this communique be drafted in
                            such a manner that the decisions in question do not appear to contradict
                            in any way those reached at an earlier moment.</p>
                        <p>The President said that these questions could be usefully discussed
                            tomorrow as it had been suggested by the King.</p>
                        <p>The King said that the President, as a person bearing extremely heavy
                            responsibilities, and as a friend of Morocco, certainly understands that
                            the King would not wish in any way to repudiate any part of his father's
                            political will. At the same time, schools, equipment, and hospitals
                            certainly will give more food to the Moroccan people than would the
                            evacuation of some telecommunications facilities. This is a policy of
                            realism. Means have to be found, however, to implement it. For example,
                            civilian mixed US-Moroccan corporations might be established for the
                            reconversion of the three air bases. As for the Kenitra base, the Royal
                            Moroccan Army intended to keep it as its own facility in any case. What
                            might be done is to convert it into a school base, in which Moroccan
                            mid-shipmen would receive training from American instructors. It would
                            be necessary to consider it a Moroccan facility under Moroccan command.
                            There exists an air training facility at Marrakech which is under
                            Moroccan command and which flies exclusively the Moroccan flag. The
                            Moroccan command has, however, French assistants who are highly
                            qualified <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0255"/>from the technical
                            point of view and thanks to whom the school in question has remained
                            operational and efficient, instead of becoming a museum piece as it
                            might have been without French assistance. Some such arrangement would
                            enable the King to say with clear conscience to his own people and to
                            friendly countries that there are no more strategic bases on Moroccan
                            territory, since three such bases are converted to civilian use and one
                            is converted into a Moroccan training facility.</p>
                        <p>This, however, is the maximum of what the King can do.</p>
                        <p>The President said that such an approach appeared fruitful. The details
                            would have to be discussed between the ministers.</p>
                        <p>The King said that it is essential that the negotiating parties be kept
                            small and tight. The Soviets are certainly interested in what is being
                            discussed between the Moroccans and the Americans. The French are
                            likewise interested, the more so that they were forced to give up
                            Kenitra. “My friend” Nasser likewise is ready to say that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII1">Hassan II</persName> has sold Moroccan soil for
                            American gold, in spite of the fact that Nasser himself has 500 Soviet
                            technicians on his territory. The King can say with clear conscience
                            that he has not sold any part or parcel of Moroccan territory, but he
                            would not wish to see Moroccan public opinion poisoned by an adverse
                            propaganda. Therefore, the communique must be drafted in such a way as
                            to make it clear that the 1959 agreements on base evacuation continue to
                            hold. As for the details on further cooperation, that might be described
                            in an exchange of letters between the ministers of foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the King whether other members of the negotiating
                            groups could be brought in. The King suggested that Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHA2">Balafrej</persName> and Ahardane be brought in
                            from the Moroccan side.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> would be called in on the American side.</p>
                        <p>After the four secretaries had come in, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BHA2"
                                >Balafrej</persName> suggested that Prince Moulay Abdallah also be
                            invited.</p>

                        <p>I'd urge that our interests in Morocco, including Kenitra, simply don't
                            justify more aid. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> feels the same
                            way. So urge you resist upping <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963
                                <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> and rely for elbow room on line
                            that we'll consider any good project loan applications Moroccans come up
                            with. Why not tell them we can move Kenitra to Spain for $10 million and
                            don't see why we should pay more when we're giving up three <gloss
                                target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases. My sense is that the Moroccans
                            will buy what we've offered, even if reluctantly. <persName

                            viewed as political testament, faithfully executed. President at opening

                            air bases on schedule. King repeated oral assurances Mohamed V had given

                            (Text aide-memoire being pouched Rabat.) King expressed dissatisfaction
                            at figures but did not press subject. At one point, he asked President
                            cost of removing Kenitra facilities to another location; he was told
                            about $10 million. In final meeting with President, King said nature
                            arrangements arrived at during visit changed both nature and intensity
                            relationship. King expressed understanding difficulties in obtaining

                            subjected severe pressure because of Clay Report (which Moroccans well
                            aware of) and of balance of payments deficit to make severe cuts.

                                made clear it cannot condone activities directed against other free

                        <p>We have reached a critical point in the Air Force withdrawal from the
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> bases in Morocco. The Air Force
                            is holding at Nouasseur certain property recommended by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss> as needed for the conversion of this
                            base to a civil airport. The property is non-excess to Air Force needs,
                            however, and arrangements must be made to reimburse the Air Force for
                            its value ($650,000). To this end, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            has included this sum in the Development Loan under negotiation with the
                            Moroccans for the Nouasseur conversion project.</p>
                        <p>While the Moroccans have stated their willingness to pay for the property
                            with Development Loan financing, this has not yet been reduced to
                            writing. In the absence of a written Moroccan commitment, <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is unwilling to give the Air Force the
                            firm assurances it needs before it can relinquish the property involved.
                            In turn, the Air Force, which has frozen the property since August,
                            states that, unless it receives assurances of reimbursement now, it must
                            begin shipping the property out. To delay further would greatly increase
                            the costs to the Air Force of removing the property, if this could be
                            accomplished at all by the December 31st withdrawal deadline.</p>
                        <p>Our efforts to gain from <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> the
                            assurances that the Air Force needs have been unavailing. <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is unwilling to assume any risk,
                            regardless of how small, that the Development Loan might not go through.
                            If the Air Force starts shipping the property, however, we can expect a
                            strong reaction from the Moroccans, with the real possibility that our
                            objectives at Kenitra would be endangered.</p>

                        <p>On November 20, 1963, the Department of State conveyed its reservations
                            about highlighting U.S. withdrawal from U.S. bases in Morocco any more
                            than absolutely necessary to Ambassador Ferguson in Rabat. The
                            Department noted that despite U.S. efforts to get Moroccan cooperation
                            on post-withdrawal operation of the bases, the Moroccans had given no
                            indication of their readiness to take over, and Washington agencies
                            (except in the case of Nouasseur) were not prepared to assume long-term
                            responsibility. The Ambassador was instructed to inform the Moroccan
                            Government that the U.S. Air Force intended to relinquish Ben Guerir and
                            Sidi Slimane on December 2 and Nouasseur on December 16, and that all
                            U.S. responsibility for the bases would cease on those dates. It was
                            hoped that news of the early withdrawals from Ben Guerir and Sidi
                            Slimane would move the Moroccan Government into taking some action at
                            Nouasseur, where a breakdown of operating capability would be all the
                            more embarrassing in view of the plans for its utilization. The
                            Department stated that civilian technicians still in Morocco could
                            operate the Nouasseur utilities if hired promptly by the Moroccan
                            Government or <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, but not unassisted
                            for any length of time. (Telegram 1159 to Rabat; Department of State,

                        <p>On December 6, the Embassy in Rabat reported that the last Air Force
                            contingents had left Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir on the morning of
                            December 2, but that it had received no reaction to its note of November
                            22 giving the evacuation dates nor any expression of interest in
                            employing technicians after December 16. (Telegram 873 from Rabat;
                            ibid.) The Department asked the Ambassador on December 9 to raise the
                            question of widespread pilferage at the bases formally and at the
                            highest possible level, and to reiterate that the United States accepted
                            no responsibility for the condition of the bases at their transfer since
                            the Moroccan Army had been present on them for months for the specific
                            purpose of maintaining their physical security and equipment intact.

                        <p>On December 11, Ferguson reported that he had told Foreign Minister
                            Guedira that the United States was not planning any base turnover
                            ceremonies at either Nouasseur or Kenitra, and that Guedira had asked
                            whether some of the U.S. officers in Morocco could be present at such
                            ceremonies if they were organized by Moroccans. (Telegram 901 from
                            Rabat; ibid.) The Department responded that the Ambassador was
                            authorized to permit participation in such ceremonies to the extent he
                            thought required. (Telegram 1216 to Rabat, December 12; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Before the turnover ceremony on December 16, Ambassador Ferguson met with

                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> confirmed our

                            increasing it following high-level consideration of Tunisia's needs.</p>
                        <p>The Country Team had recommended an <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61
                            aid level of $30 million. Because of congressional cuts and anticipated
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> expenditures (which have not
                            materialized) the actual level was fixed at $20 million. However after
                            the presidential correspondence mentioned above an additional $5 million
                            was to be set aside in our contingency funds to enable us to meet
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>'s
                            commitments. Recent reports from Tunisia have made clear that this
                            increase is absolutely essential if crippling cuts—perhaps as much as
                            18%—in Tunisia's economic development program are to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Since the exchange of letters, we have carefully reviewed Tunisia's needs
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName>, Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary for Economic Affairs in the African Bureau, made a special
                            visit to Tunis where he personally examined the Tunisian intensive labor
                            program. He was greatly impressed by Tunisian efforts and feels the
                            example Tunisia is setting is one we should do everything to encourage.
                            AF is convinced therefore that in order not only to honor our commitment
                            without further delay but to consolidate our good relations with Tunisia
                            and promote it as an example for other African nations, we should
                            arrange as soon as possible to inform President <persName

                        <p rend="center">UNITED STATES-TUNISIAN POLITICAL RELATIONS</p>
                        <p>Since independence Tunisia has tended to look to the United States to
                            provide a counter weight to pressures exerted on Tunisia by France and
                            to an increasing extent by the Algerians. Tunisia is too small a country
                            to carry much weight with either of these elements, although its
                            economic, cultural and political future is inextricably tied to them.
                            Consequently, Tunisia feels that it must work with both France and
                            Algeria but to do so safely it must be able to count on support in
                            critical moments from powerful friends. <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> has constantly sought such support from the
                            United States. The United States, he reasons, is in a position to exert
                            pressure on France to be more understanding of North African needs and
                            the United States has the economic resources to fill at least partially
                            the gap in capital investment which has resulted from the cutting off in
                            1957 of direct French economic assistance to Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>An active United States interest in North Africa also serves from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s point of view to
                            protect the area against Soviet penetration. <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> does not believe in turning his back on the
                            Soviet Bloc altogether. Such a policy would needlessly alienate his
                            younger supporters and play into the hands of his foreign adversaries
                            who constantly portray him as being a tool of the West. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> also considers that it is too
                            much to expect the United States or even the United States and Western
                            Europe to fill all of Tunisia's needs for foreign capital. He is
                            therefore prepared to consider, although very carefully, any aid offers
                            which the Soviet Bloc might be willing to extend. To date the Tunisians
                            have been unimpressed by the kinds of equipment and techniques which the
                            Russians are prepared to make available to Tunisia. They have found
                            satellite offers considerably more interesting, but to date there has
                            been little concrete Bloc activity in Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> is
                            even more interested in securing a United States commitment to support
                            his regime than in the past. Even assuming a settlement with the
                            Algerians is reached, he foresees a period during which North Africa is
                            likely to go through considerable political and social unrest. He does
                            not wish to isolate himself from these developments but rather to
                            influence them in the direction of the reformist and <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"/>essentially moderate policies which
                            guide his own country. To do this, he needs the moral backing which can
                            accrue to him through demonstrated United States-Tunisia ties. If such
                            ties could lead also to similar relations between the United States and
                            the Algerians and a more democratic Moroccan regime, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> would be even more pleased.
                            This is not to say that <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>
                            has abandoned his long search for a <persName corresp="#p_FB2"
                                >Franco</persName>-Maghreb community of interest, but he probably
                            believes that, for a variety of reasons, relations between France and
                            the Maghreb will be full of difficulties for many years to come, as
                            legacies from the former colonial relationships are slowly converted
                            into more satisfactory arrangements in an atmosphere of mutuality. He
                            would hope that the United States would influence France as the stronger
                            power to be generous in its treatment of specific issues. However, if
                            this should not happen (and <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> is as aware as any one that <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> feels he must set his own pace), he looks to the
                            United States to protect his regime and to act in ways open to it to
                            prevent the Soviet Union from exploiting to its own benefit differences
                            within North Africa and between North Africa and France. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> was most impressed by our
                            willingness to aid General <persName>De Gaulle</persName> in crushing
                            the abortive coup of the ex-generals and by the statement of the
                            Department's official spokesman that the United States would become
                            directly involved if the rebellion were to spread beyond Algeria's
                            borders. He considers these statements to be responsive to Tunisia's own
                            expression of concern and will wish to thank the President for
                            reaffirming in this way the importance the United States attaches to the
                            maintenance of Tunisia's sovereignty and independence.</p>

                            expressed hope that long-term plan on which <gloss target="#t_GOT1"
                                >GOT</gloss> actually working could form framework for multi-year

                        <p>In general, talks confirmed that U.S. and Tunisia had common approach on

                                told Lebel that it was “particularly painful” for the United States

                                involved in a situation of this kind and said he thought that

                        <p>You might wish to tell the Tunisian Ambassador that we are most disturbed

                            reconcile their differences among themselves. You might add that
                            recourse to the Security Council is bound to bring cold war issues into
                            this question, particularly now at the time of the Berlin crisis, and
                            will certainly affect United States freedom of action. Furthermore these
                            difficulties prejudice gravely France's ability to be forthcoming at the
                            Evian negotiations and the entire matter opens up opportunities to
                            adversaries of both the United States and Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>You might say that you hope the Tunisian Government will reconsider its
                            decision to bring this matter to the Security Council and say that we
                            are urging the French to take such steps as might facilitate this.</p>

                            a cease-fire and commencement of negotiations. Both countries agreed
                            that adoption of some sort of U.N. resolution would be necessary despite

                            for “an immediate cease-fire and a return of all armed forces to their

                            reach agreement on a definitive resolution. A draft resolution sponsored
                            by Liberia and the United Arab Republic, which called upon both parties
                            to enter into immediate negotiations aimed at the speedy evacuation of
                            French forces from all of Tunisia, lost by a vote of 4 to 0 with 7
                            abstentions (including the United States and France) because it failed
                            to gain the necessary 7 votes for adoption. The draft resolution

                        <p>On July 23, <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> reported that the
                            French were “on the whole pleased” with the outcome in the Security
                            Council, while the Tunisians were “deeply unhappy” at the failure of the
                            United States and its friends to support them on the evacuation issue.
                            In light of the strong Tunisian resentment, he advised that they should
                            immediately agree to airlift Tunisian troops from the Congo. In view of
                            strong Tunisian objections to the presence of the base on their
                            territory, <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> urged that the
                            United States exert its full influence with the French so that the issue

                        <p>On July 27, 1961, Tunisia again requested that the U.N. Security Council
                            be convened on grounds that French military forces had not complied with
                            the interim resolution of July 22. On July 28, the French Government
                            issued a statement declaring its preference for a settlement of the
                            Bizerte problem through direct negotiations with Tunisia. The same day,
                            the French Government informed the Security Council that French troops
                            had not refused to obey the cease-fire, that Tunisia had not accepted
                            French proposals for talks concerning procedures for restoring normal
                            conditions in Bizerte, and that, therefore, France did not consider it
                            necessary to participate in any further debate on this subject in the
                            Security Council.</p>
                        <p>On July 28, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"

                            who told him that France would not participate in U.N. deliberations on
                            Bizerte nor be influenced by any resolutions distasteful to France.
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> indicated, however, that France did
                            not intend to remain in Bizerte forever. The French President also
                            warned <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> that the
                            Atlantic Alliance was at stake. (Telegram 509 from Paris, July 28;

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CMMC1">Couve de Murville</persName> and
                            expressed U.S. concern at the serious division which Bizerte might cause
                            among Western countries and asked if France would consider acknowledging
                            publicly the principle of eventual evacuation. Couve replied that it was
                            not the French intention to remain permanently in Bizerte, but that they
                            could not leave right away and would not leave under pressure even if
                            the base were worthless. (Telegram 521 from Paris, July 29; ibid.,

                        <p>On July 29, the Security Council considered three new draft resolutions.
                            Two of these were sponsored by Ceylon, Liberia, and the United Arab
                            Republic and concentrated on France's failure to comply with the
                            resolution of July 22. Each received 4 affirmative votes (the sponsors
                            joined by the Soviet Union) with 6 abstentions. The third resolution,
                            which was sponsored by Turkey and supported by the United States,
                            expressed concern that the interim resolution had not been fully carried
                            out and called for its immediate and full implementation. A third
                            operative paragraph urged the early opening of negotiations for a
                            peaceful resolution of differences, “including a definitive settlement
                            of the question of Bizerte, having due regard for Tunisian sovereignty.”

                            subsequent debate, the third paragraph was dropped. The remainder of the
                            resolution also failed adoption by a vote of 6 to 0, with 4 abstentions.

                            and others present, Secretary said we committed to and fully support
                            Tunisian independence and sovereignty and it is US interest that problem
                            be solved with preservation our friendship with Tunisia, with France,
                            and with preservation friendship of Tunisia and France for each other.
                            Despite high emotions both sides we convinced, as a result our
                            soundings, basic motivations both sides are such that agreement can be
                            reached <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>quickly once initial
                            obstacles to negotiations overcome. Problem thus one of method.</p>
                        <p>Secretary emphasized high-level initial contacts should not be considered
                            vital. Said US supports position that future of Bizerte must be
                            consistent with sovereignty of Tunisia, and is for Tunisia to decide. He
                            assured Ladgham US willing work to make this come about. Said in Paris
                            he would actively examine ways to find solution.</p>
                        <p>Ladgham promised <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would provide
                            assurances re civil order and military communications between French
                            installations as soon as French announced intent to effect troop
                            pull-back and departure significant number recent reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>Secretary strongly emphasized our view that, now that US prestige
                            directly involved, there be no disruption cease-fire. In return for
                            assumption by US of this role, with time and prestige of Secretary
                            directly involved, we entitled to be given full opportunity have our
                            efforts succeed.</p>
                        <p>Accepting importance this US undertaking, Ladgham agreed to recommend to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>, on his return
                            to Tunis 6 p.m. local time tomorrow, that action leading to emergency

                                D 330)</note></p>
                        <p>Secretary explained that while we did not wish meddle, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FB2">Franco</persName>-Tunisian matter one which vitally
                            touched our own interests, particularly its effect on Berlin problem.
                            Secretary regretted fact already some 47 nations which were anxious
                            scold France, US and other western powers would in <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> probably use against us words which we
                            might want employ ourselves with respect to Berlin before end of year.
                            Secretary explained saw no reason why question could not be solved since
                            he did not believe either France or Tunisia contemplated future
                            hostilities toward each other; matters probably had gone further and
                            faster than anyone had wanted them to and he thought it would be useful
                            to explore means of easing tensions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he understood that French would be prepared pull their
                            forces back into base if they could receive assurances regarding
                            communications and that law and order would be maintained in area
                            concerned. Secretary also said he understood Tunisians prepared give
                            such assurances. Thus question was how get matter started.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said he thought he should start beginning and explain
                            how whole matter evolved. After considerable detail of past since 1955,
                            including <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>-De Gaulle
                            talks, Couve said he thought immediate cause of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s action last month resulted
                            from latter's failure obtain Moroccan and <gloss target="#t_FLN1"
                                >FLN</gloss> support for his maghrebian ambitions, his Sahara claim
                            difficulty, and generally finding himself on bad terms with Morocco,
                            Egypt and Algeria, thus <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>
                            felt forced play role on international stage.</p>
                        <p>Incident with which everyone familiar ensued. Couve explained France's
                            present position very much as set forth Embassy telegram 658:<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d171fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., Central Files,
                                772.56351/8-461)</note></p>
                        <p>French must maintain base as long as world situation remains tense and
                            must be judge of when it is safe to leave. They do not intend stay in
                            Bizerte “forever,” but not publicly prepared at this juncture make
                            declaration that effect. Quite prepared discuss future of base with
                            Tunisians, <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>but obviously cannot
                            do this while under pressure. Believe that these discussions which must
                            take place between Tunisians and French divide into two stages: (A)
                            reestablishment of peaceful situation in Bizerte or modalities of
                            evacuation, and (B) reestablishment of some sort relations which will
                            permit discussions concerning future of base. They cannot accept
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s conditions under
                            present situation with some two thousand Tunisian soldiers in Bizerte
                            City, exits of which French control to prevent smuggling in of arms.
                            Foreign Minister explained complicated physical situation of base which
                            is well known. When he referred to contact telephonic and personal
                            between French Consulate General and Tunisian Government Secretary asked
                            why these would not afford opportunity for Consulate General to discuss
                            matter of troop withdrawals, etc.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister indicated that might be possible for Consulate General's
                            conversations to develop more substance than so far but that he thought
                            it would take time for them progress very far. In answer direct question
                            he said he did not foresee much progress within next few days; he
                            mentioned possibly weeks to discuss matter reestablishment normal life,
                            evacuation, etc. Said French must move very cautiously to avoid future
                            incidents.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister touched on matter of “hostages,” or some five hundred
                            French civilians being held in prison, an amount approximately same as
                            some six hundred Tunisians being held by French. He agreed this might
                            lead to exchange of prisoners.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister was not too concerned with regard to possibility special
                            General Assembly. In first place he did not feel at all certain it would
                            take place, since Soviets were opposed to addressing letter directly
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary indicated we were extremely concerned with possibility special
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> himself was most anxious avoid
                            this, particulary in view Berlin. Foreign Minister asked how Secretary
                            saw Tunisian crisis affecting Berlin, saying he believed a crisis must
                            be nourished and once <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> over Tunisian
                            matter would normalize itself.</p>
                        <p>Secretary disagreed, believing there would be calls for volunteers,
                            guerilla activities, reprisals against French, etc. Foreign Minister
                            doubted <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> prepared take on
                            both French and Algerian armies. He also thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> would not wish have his
                            Saharan action discussed <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> since
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> had endeavored
                            establish his position by force. <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> had never mentioned fact that some two hundred
                            Tunisian casualties involved this operation.</p>
                        <p>In answer to Secretary's suggestion that France, more powerful nation,
                            might make some gesture toward smaller nation, Couve replied that he had
                            thought two days ago of taking initiative for direct discussions <pb
                                n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0287"/>with Tunisians but learned that
                            Tunisians did not want discussions.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Foreign Minister indicated he saw no difficulty in French
                            Consul General's conversations with Tunisians being broadened and would
                            see what could be done this connection. Couve entirely appreciated

                            was quite clear he considers it a French affair, none of our business,

                        <p>France boycotted the U.N. General Assembly special session on Bizerte,
                            which began on August 21, 1961. The general debate, in which 53
                            delegations participated, continued until August 25. A draft resolution
                            sponsored by 32 members was introduced calling “the presence of French
                            armed forces in Tunisian territory against the express will of the
                            Tunisian Government and people a violation of Tunisia's sovereignty,”
                            recognizing “the sovereign right of Tunisia to call for the withdrawal
                            of all French armed forces present on its territory without its
                            consent,” and calling upon the Governments of France and Tunisia “to
                            enter into immediate negotiations to devise peaceful and agreed measures
                            in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations
                            for the withdrawal of all French armed forces from Tunisian
                            territory.”</p>
                        <p>Speaking before the General Assembly on August 22, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> said that the United States
                            believed that the only solution to the crisis was through negotiations
                            between France and Tunisia and that it did not believe that it would be
                            useful for the General Assembly to adopt “a resolution which, regardless
                            of its merits, might serve only to prolong the present stalemate.” For

                            30 abstentions (including the United States). For text of the resolution

                                    operations would assist in the control of sea lines of

                        <p>While recognizing that the United States faces a political dilemma in how

                            France and still maintain a satisfactory political relationship with the
                            Government of Tunisia, I concur with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, if
                            politically feasible, it would be desirable to have the use of the
                            Bizerte facilities available to the Free World after the present
                            difficulties have been resolved.</p>

                            <p>“Dear Mr. President,</p>
                            <p>I greatly appreciate your letter of August 12, and want to thank you
                                also for the welcome visits to Washington of Messrs. Ladgham and
                                Hourani.</p>
                            <p>I am indeed anxious to reestablish with you a communication which
                                seems to have been partially interrupted by the incidents of
                                Bizerte. I am deeply aware of the reasons why your press and public
                                opinion should feel a sense of disappointment or even
                                disillusionment with what must have seemed to be a lessening of the
                                support and friendship of the United States for Tunisia in an hour
                                of need.</p>
                            <p>But I hope that I do not have to reassure you, Mr. President, of the
                                constancy of our feeling towards Tunisia. You have been kept
                                informed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WWNJ1"
                                    >Walmsley</persName> as well as by Mr. Ladgham, Mr. Hourani,
                                Ambassador Slim and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BH6"
                                    >Bourguiba</persName>, Jr. of the deep personal interest which
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and I
                                personally have exerted in an effort to seek a solution of this
                                tragic crisis between two nations who have many close ties with each
                                other. Standing as my country does close to a holocaust that could
                                destroy the US as well as Europe and much of the East, I have not
                                found it possible to take a public position on this matter
                                satisfactory to you. I regret this greatly, but I am hopeful that
                                you will recognize our difficulties as well as those of your country
                                in these days.</p>
                            <p>We have felt deeply this tragedy, not only because of our own
                                intimate association with both parties, but because we know that
                                essentially <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>the differences
                                between you are not irreconcilable. It is for this reason that we
                                felt that careful diplomacy could heal the wounds of pride and
                                prestige which both sides feel they have suffered.</p>
                            <p>We have tried to be helpful, as a sincere friend of both parties. We
                                intend to continue these efforts, Mr. President, by whatever means
                                appear to be propitious. If there has been a difference of opinion
                                between us, it has been solely on tactics, how best to exert our
                                influence usefully to help bring about a solution which, ultimately,
                                can only result from negotiations between Tunisia and France.</p>
                            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has told your
                                representatives that this is a battle which Tunisia, in the exercise
                                of her sovereignty, cannot lose. There remains the problem of
                                working out the details. Knowing as you do my disposition and
                                sentiments, you will I trust not hesitate to communicate to me an
                                indication as to the means by which you may now deem it would be
                                useful for the United States to act to bring about a genuine
                                settlement of the problem of Bizerte.</p>

                                Tunisia is years ahead of countries we have just visited south of
                                Sahara. I think most important consideration of all is influence
                                which Tunisia, small in itself, can have, we hope, in greater
                                Maghreb context. No telling what problems we will face in future
                                Algeria and we will need all restraint, moderation and influence
                                Tunisia, as friend of West, can bring to bear. If Tunisia is not
                                proof, politically and economically, of advantages close cooperation
                                with West, we will certainly have hard time making headway in
                                Algeria. In short, I counsel continued emphasis on Tunisia for

                        <p>As you recall, the Patterson Survey Team submitted its appraisal of the
                            Tunisian Plan on 20 December. On 21 February Hutchinson told Plan
                            Secretary Ben Salah informally that <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            would recommend a Presidential determination authorizing a $180 million
                            commitment, as soon as Salah furnished certain specific assurances and a
                            copy of the plan. Both were received by 30 March and <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> began preparing determination papers.
                            With <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s concurrence, <persName

                            formulation of action programs, and has generally been consistently

                            North African neighbors, 3) the restoration in non-colonial form of
                            Tunisia's former special and mutually beneficial ties with France, 4)
                            the creation of economic relationships that reflect and exploit the
                            economic interdependence of the Maghrebian states and the interest these

                            on critical cold-war issues. 2) In Afro-Asian circles it has exercised a
                            responsible and pro-western role. 3) Its development methods provide a
                            good model and the extent of its national self-help is high. 4) It has
                            certain strategic importance. 5) It is a good example of a state with
                            one-party political institutions administered in a manner which gives
                            some encouragement to western concepts of freedom. 6) It is a leader
                            among the nations promoting the decolonization of the southern third of
                            Africa in a manner designed to eliminate or minimize Communist and
                            radical nationalist influences.</p>

                        <p>United States plans, policies and programs appear to be based on sound
                            information and intelligence. Nonetheless, we need to know more about

                        <p>A greater effort should be made to obtain and exploit the knowledge

                        <p>Tunisia's goal is to become a modern state responsive to the needs of its
                            people. It is working to achieve this goal by pragmatic means, using
                            private enterprise, cooperatives or government enterprises as
                            circumstances require. At this comparatively early stage in Tunisia's
                            development, there is no alternative to a major use of government
                            enterprise. Tunisian cabinet officers and other key government officials
                            categorically state that government enterprise will give way to private
                            enterprise when the latter is ready and willing to take over.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia is controlled by one party, the Neo-Destour party, which under
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s leadership fought
                            for and achieved this country's independence. Its one-party political
                            institutions are administered in a way which gives some encouragement to
                            western concepts of freedom <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0305"/>and
                            to the development of a valid popular consensus. The Neo-Destour party
                            is making an effort to broaden its grass roots contacts with the
                            people.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName>'s popularity has been
                            diminished by Bizerte, other less major mistakes, and the inevitable
                            corrosion of original enthusiasm after several years of
                            post-independence reality. Although still strong internally, he is more
                            or less isolated from the revolutionary Arabic leaders of the Near East
                            and Algeria who may conceivably try to stir up trouble inside Tunisia at
                            some later date.</p>
                        <p>The Tunisian Government is not at present threatened by any organized
                            subversive force, Communist or otherwise. Its police and security forces
                            have good morale, possess adequate modern weapons and are capable of
                            maintaining public order. The recently attempted coup was an
                            unorganized, incoherent gesture on the part of ineffectual malcontents
                            who had no common cause. It did not reflect any deep-rooted or extensive
                            opposition to the regime. However, Tunisia's long and unmarked frontier,
                            especially with Algeria, is vulnerable to foreign-supported insurgency,
                            although any such activity at this time could be dealt with or contained
                            by Tunisian security forces.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia's Ten-Year Development Plan has been repeatedly reviewed by
                            experts and pronounced reasonable though over-optimistic. Its success,
                            as well as the size of future requirements for American aid, will depend
                            to a large extent on the resumption by France of its natural economic
                            role in Tunisia, and on the working out of mutually satisfactory
                            economic relationships by Tunisia with the Common Market as well as with
                            Morocco and Algeria. It is expected that France will during 1964 resume
                            some financial assistance to Tunisia. Hopefully within three years it
                            will be possible for Tunisia to obtain from Europe the major proportion
                            of the external assistance it then requires.</p>
                        <p>The Survey Group believes that the United States will continue to have
                            strong foreign policy reasons for playing an important, even though not
                            the most important, role in Tunisia's development for several years
                            after the expiration of our three-year commitment.</p>

                            in Tunisia's relations with France. Many important outstanding problems
                            had been resolved and the Bizerte problem seemed to be on the way to
                                solution.<note n="1" xml:id="d185fn1">On October 15, France

                            But negotiation with the French on remaining issues was difficult and
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> continued to be “mysterious.” The

                            Naturally Mr. Slim said, Tunisia opposed this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed understanding, based on U.S. experience, of
                            Tunisia's difficulties in negotiating with General De Gaulle. He said
                            that it was our conviction, however, that <persName>De Gaulle</persName>
                            has made a basic decision to put France's relations with all Arab states

                        <p>The first year of Tunisia's Three-year Plan has seen her substantially
                            achieve her investment goals by drawing down heavily on her foreign
                            exchange and restoring [resorting] to extensive internal borrowing. This
                            has generated inflationary pressures which could imperil the Plan's
                            success. The Tunisians say they were forced to rely more heavily on
                            their own resources than expected because of the slow flow of foreign
                            aid, particularly U.S. aid. (Our total commitment in support of the
                            Plan—made in July 1962—is $180 million; allocations thus far are now
                            about $35 million. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has always

                            period.) The Tunisians seem determined to maintain the scheduled pace of
                            investment in spite of the recognized risks of inflation and foreign
                            exchange depletion.</p>

                        <p>Reassure Mr. Slim of our desire to see the Plan successful and our
                            admiration of Tunisian efforts to this end. Since you last saw Mr. Slim
                            we have eased certain aid procedures to expedite the flow of aid. Within
                            the limits set by legal obligations and our balance of payments problem,
                            we will continue to make such efforts. Our hope is that Tunisia will be
                            able to find ways to make effective use of its aid commitments from
                            other foreign sources. If total foreign investment was lower than
                            planned during <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0308"/>the Plan's first
                            year, the proportion of U.S. aid to total foreign investment was higher
                            than planned—two-thirds against one-half. We believe this is fair
                            evidence of our attempts to provide aid in good time.</p>

                            only a small training program. During the past several months the
                            Tunisian Minister of Defense has indicated on several occasions to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RFH1">Russell</persName> the Tunisian
                            Government's hope that additional U.S. military assistance would be
                            forthcoming. The Tunisians have mentioned military jets especially. Our
                            response essentially has been that large quantities of equipment are now
                            being delivered under our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> (a $15
                            million program) and we believe for the present our best contribution
                            would be to assist in training in the use and maintenance of this
                            equipment.</p>

                        <p>You may wish to point out first to Mr. Slim that our readiness to supply
                            arms to Tunisia since 1957 attests to our belief that an effective
                            Tunisian military establishment will contribute importantly to stability
                            in North Africa. We continue to hold to this belief, but at this stage
                            we feel that our best contribution will be to assist Tunisia in training
                            for the utilization and maintenance of equipment still being received

                            shows in Paragraph 3. b. that the President has approved revision of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policies along the lines
                            recommended by the Secretary of State to provide flexibility for the
                            United States to supplement Western European support to
                            newly-independent areas whenever such action is in the United States
                            interest. In my judgment, this action constitutes a revision of the
                            applicable policies, but if new language is desired in all the
                            appropriate documents, we will expect to receive it from the Department

                            been interpreted in such a way as to limit unduly the flexibility and
                            freedom of action required for an effective United States approach to
                            African developments. These limitations have been based particularly on
                            the interpretation of wording of paragraphs having to do with economic
                            assistance. Typical of the language in question is that portion of
                            paragraph 34b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 6005/1 which states
                            that the United States should, to the maximum extent feasible, rely on
                            specified sources other than the U.S.</p>
                        <p>I recognize how important it is that other Free World powers,
                            particularly the former metropoles, continue and where possible expand
                            their efforts to meet the need for external capital of the territories
                            and emerging nations of the area. In our activities and programs we
                            should not take any action that would serve to discourage or supplant
                            these efforts—indeed we should make every effort to urge them to do
                            more. It is my understanding, however, based upon our discussion at the
                            Council meeting of February 9 in which the Secretary of the Treasury
                            participated, that the language of the policy is in the future to be
                            interpreted in such a way as to provide the needed flexibility and
                            freedom of action. Under this interpretation we would not, for example,
                            be called upon for such a strong burden of proof as has been required in
                            the past that the needed assistance was not available from others,
                            before proceeding with assistance deemed to be in the United States
                            interest.</p>

                        <p>As you know, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy places
                            preliminary dependence for meeting the military needs of the countries
                            in the area upon the former colonial powers. Strict interpretation of
                            this policy reduces our ability to quickly react to requests for
                            assistance or to achieve maximum political benefit. Too often our
                            assistance has been furnished only after the threat, or actual
                            acceptance, of Soviet military assistance. While it is entirely
                            reasonable that Western military assistance to these African countries
                            should be coordinated, the delay experienced in determining the
                            Metropole's position, the mechanics for coordination with respect to
                            types of equipment and training each country will provide, and the
                            subsequent negotiations with the recipient all tend to retard prompt
                            U.S. response. The ability to react rapidly once a decision has been
                            made to furnish assistance is extremely important to these countries in
                            their current stage of development.</p>

                        <p>There are other problems that arise with respect to funding of new
                            unbudgeted programs and the establishment of sufficiently high program
                            priority to permit the early delivery of equipment to gain maximum
                            impact of programs which are basically political in nature. At present,
                            our military assistance programs in this area are the result of mounting
                            political pressures and are developed on an ad hoc basis without clear
                            long-term U.S. goals, either from a political or a military point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>It would be appreciated if you could undertake to develop a Defense
                            policy position for military assistance to independent nations south of
                            the Sahara which could be utilized by the Joint Staff and this office in
                            evaluating and developing future programs. I would suggest that your
                            analysis treat the Union of South Africa as a separate entity due to its
                            peculiar position.</p>

                            DEVELOPMENTS IN COLONIAL AFRICA</p>
                        <p>This National Intelligence Estimate was approved by the United States
                            Intelligence Board on 11 April 1961. Significant judgments of this
                            Estimate are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Over the next three years, virtually all the remaining British dependent
                            territories in Africa, as well as the Belgian trusteeship of
                            Ruanda-Urundi, will almost certainly become independent. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> regime has adamantly refused
                            even to consider self-government for the Portuguese territories, much
                            less eventual independence, despite the growing African agitation. We
                            see no prospect for a change in Portuguese policy which could avoid
                            violence and repression in the colonies <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
                                facs="0313"/>of <hi rend="italic">Angola, Mozambique</hi>, and <hi
                                rend="italic">Portuguese Guinea</hi>. Nor do we believe that
                            Portugal alone has the military and economic resources to bear the long
                            and bloody struggle that its present policies seem to ensure. While no
                            substantial nationalist sentiment has appeared as yet in the Spanish
                            areas, the Saharan territories will be increasingly threatened by
                            Moroccan adventures.</p>
                        <p>The areas containing sizable European populations (notably Kenya, the
                            Rhodesias, Angola, and Mozambique) are the principal danger points for
                            racial strife. Outbreaks among Africans are likely in areas in which
                            there are deep tribal antagonisms, such as Ruanda-Urundi and Kenya.
                            While in most areas presently available security forces will probably be
                            able to cope with sporadic, localized disturbances, widespread violence
                            could be controlled only with the aid of metropole or other outside
                            reinforcements. After independence, the quality and capabilities of
                            security forces are likely to deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>Both before and after independence, most of the territories will labor in
                            varying degrees under the handicaps of strong tribal animosities,
                            rivalries between competing political parties and leaders, weak and
                            underdeveloped economies and shortages of trained personnel. These
                            handicaps will inhibit the growth of effective and stable
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Most areas will expect and need outside support and economic aid after
                            independence. They probably hope also to obtain military assist-ance. We
                            believe that they will look first to the West but that most will adopt
                            neutralist policies and be receptive to Bloc assistance.</p>
                        <p>In the dependent areas the Bloc will be alert to foment and exploit to
                            the disadvantage of the West any dissidence or trouble, even to the
                            extent of clandestine supply of arms. However, we believe that Communist
                            activities in these areas have not yet reached significant levels.</p>

                            <item>In considering the above two proposals, together with the points
                                cited in the referenced memorandum, the Joint Chiefs of Staff note
                                that these notions are inspired largely by a growing feeling that
                                there is a need for action to forestall a possible African “arms
                                race.” There is evidence of some armament activity in Africa. In the
                                main, however, the present rate of acquisition of armed forces by
                                new African nations arises from the need to furnish authority to
                                government, to assure internal security, and acquire the trappings
                                of sovereignty. Where some acceleration can be noted, it is mostly
                                attributable to Sino-Soviet Bloc subversive activity in the military
                                area. This is a symptom of the East-West Cold War in Africa rather
                                than one of African arms competition.</item>

                            <item>The solution to the African “arms race” is tied up in the
                                political solution to the East-West Cold War. While there is need to
                                forestall any developing arms race, serious political and military
                                disadvantages should not be accepted by the West in an attempt to
                                achieve this end.</item>

                                arrangements would be in effect, still would be open to strong
                                Soviet pressures and influence. While the proposed measures could
                                offer some impediment to Soviet military operations and could reduce
                                Soviet military infiltration of Africa, the Soviets are unlikely to
                                abandon their efforts to dominate the area. Any adoption of
                                atom-free/arms control measures would simply cause the Bloc to
                                intensify its political, economic and cultural efforts in attempting
                                to make further gains on the African continent. Also, they could be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ros</hi>: I have had the Department make a
                            thorough study of U.S. policy on the supply of arms to Tropical Africa.
                            This study, which I have approved, is set forth in the attachment to
                            this letter.<note n="1" xml:id="d193fn1">Attached but not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>As I know you agree, one of our paramount objectives is to avoid the
                            buildup of an arms race with the Soviets in Africa. On the other hand,
                            we must be prepared to supply some arms to the newly emerging states of
                            Tropical Africa if U.S. interests are to be advanced and Communist
                            encroachment frustrated. The newly emerging African states will insist
                            upon exercising what they view to be their sovereign prerogatives of
                            establishing some military forces, and they will turn to Communist
                            sources of supply if assistance from Western sources is not forthcoming.
                            However, I believe that we should be able, through determined and astute
                            dealing, to meet this essentially politically justified requirement by
                            providing for limited programs of an internal security nature. To this
                            end, cooperation between our two Departments is obviously essential so
                            that we can move forward smoothly and purposefully whenever that is
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>We must endeavor, to the maximum degree feasible, to avoid large arms
                            buildups in Tropical Africa which drain away resources required for
                            economic development and which could contribute to tension and
                            animosities between neighboring states. We are proceeding to develop our
                            views as to the manner in which U.S. policy can contribute to the
                            encouragement of regional arrangements within Africa designed to limit
                            arms buildup beyond this internal security level. This effort we
                            recognize as a difficult one, requiring a well considered educational
                            program. To the extent that it is successful in achieving its objectives
                            it will be at a more distant point in time. In the meantime we view the
                            positive arms supply policy set forth in the attachment to this letter
                            as an essential interrelated action, indeed to some extent even a
                            precondition to achieving success on arms limitation, which should not
                            be delayed.</p>
                        <p>Because the objectives of the United States arms supply in Africa are
                            essentially political in nature and involve nations which pose foreign
                            policy problems in many respects quite unique as compared to those which
                            we have encountered elsewhere in the world, I think it highly important
                            for our people, working closely with your staff and <gloss

                            <item>There are two reasons why the major Western powers must concert
                                their policies in Southeast Asia and Africa. First, the Communists
                                are systematically exploiting our differences in policy. They have
                                been a major Communist asset in Africa and Southeast Asia. These
                                differences arise out of the special history of each Western power
                                in each area and from differing short-run interests. The historical
                                differences in outlook must be overcome in the face of present
                                reality. The lesser short-run interests must be resolved so that the
                                larger common interests may come to dominate Western policy in these
                                areas. Second, situations arising in Southeast Asia and, perhaps, in
                                Africa, may draw us close to a test of military strength with the
                                Communists. The possibility of armed conflict affects all of our
                                peoples, notably in an age of nuclear weapons. Moreover, the
                                possibility of a deterring conflict depends substantially on our <pb
                                    n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0319"/>presenting a united front
                                to the Communists. For these reasons, political and military, the
                                President believes that high level tripartite discussions of a
                                Western strategy in Africa and Asia are urgent. In this matter he
                                finds himself close to the views of General De Gaulle.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>. The President profoundly respects
                                the deep understanding of the revolutionary forces at work in
                                Africa, which President <persName>De Gaulle</persName> has revealed.
                                Due to French and British statesmanship the West has some chance of
                                developing over a period of years an Africa which would present us
                                with only modest military and political dangers, and which might, in
                                time, form a constructive part of the Western system.</item>

                            <item>In Africa, Britain and France are still bearing a primary
                                responsibility; but the U.S. is being drawn increasingly into
                                African affairs. In some areas we are working well together; in
                                others we have not yet found a wholly satisfactory basis for common
                                action.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In the President's view, what is basically required is a common
                                Western strategy rooted in three objectives. First, where positions
                                of potential political stability and strength exist, we should work
                                with all the wisdom and resources we can muster to create islands of
                                responsibility. For example, this seems possible in Tunisia,
                                Nigeria, and possibly the Ivory Coast. Second, we must work together
                                to fend off Communist efforts to trap areas in Africa where the
                                great revolutionary forces at work have given the Communists
                                opportunity to expand their influence. Mali appears such a case of
                                potential danger, and the Horn of Africa area. Third, we must work
                                together to minimize dangers to the common interest arising from the
                                painful process of disengagement from colonialism. Here Angola is
                                much on our minds. (How much better off we all would be if we had
                                begun three or four years ago to consult seriously together on the
                                Congo and Angola.)</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Frankly, the U.S. has quite enough commitments in the world, and
                                there is no compulsion in the American Government to extend those
                                commitments where our allies, much strengthened by their remarkable
                                growth in the 1950's can deal with the situation. But we are
                                prepared to sit down and consider together with Britain and
                                France—and with other Western nations where their interests are
                                involved—the broad lines of a common strategy and how the day-to-day
                                tactics and tasks of execution may best be allocated and
                                managed.</item>

                            <item>With respect to North Africa, the President has been impressed by
                                General De Gaulle's vision of the kind of regional development which
                                would be possible after the Algerian settlement is achieved.
                                President <persName corresp="#p_BH6">Bourguiba</persName> is
                                obviously thinking in similar terms. This is a matter in which
                                initiative must arise, evidently, from the Mediterranean powers; but
                                the U.S. is anxious to be helpful in the evolution of a constructive
                                regional solution in the long run. And its emergence as a realistic
                                objective <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0320"/>could conceivably
                                contribute to the pacification of the North African area.</item>

                        <p>The President said that he wanted to discuss the African problems both
                            the most direct problems of that continent as well as those of
                            relationships between Western Europe and Africa. The U.S. recognizes
                            French experience and French interest in that area. U.S. interests are
                            only complementary and consist mainly in preventing a Communist
                            ingression to that area and the ingression of the cold war itself into
                            Africa. The problem is one of method. If the President understands
                            correctly, General <persName>De Gaulle</persName> does not think that
                            the United Nations constitutes the best instrument for dealing with
                            African questions and, in particular, that of the Congo. The only
                            advantage which the President sees in relying on the U.N. (and even that
                            advantage is one that is somewhat decreasing as <pb n="293"
                                xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>time goes on) is that action taken at
                            the U.N. may prevent a direct clash between East and West. The U.S. is
                            worrying not only about the Congo but also about Angola and in the
                            latter case not only because our Portuguese friends are concerned in it
                            but because the situation is rapidly deteriorating with Ghana, Guinea
                            and the Communists taking a hand. In addition, the loss of Angola to
                            Portugal would create serious economic difficulties to the latter
                            country.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>De Gaulle</persName> said that there are many Africas.
                            There is Black Africa and even Black Africa is very diverse. There is,
                            for example, a country such as Senegal which has a long history of
                            continuous relations with the West and from which many migrants and
                            traders have gone to many countries even to the U.S. There are other
                            countries of Black Africa which have always been poor and which tend
                            therefore to lean towards extreme solutions. France has had a lot of
                            experience in Black Africa having colonized an important part of it,
                            important not so much because of its population (which amounted only to
                            twenty-five million) but because of the land area represented. French
                            colonization was very fraternal and the French have educated many
                            administrators and political men in those countries. Decolonization was
                            also friendly and most of the French possessions want to preserve their
                            ties with France. An exception is Guinea and Guinea is an exception
                            because of <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> who is a
                            Communist and who not having been able to keep both French aid and a
                            Communist organization preferred to renounce the former. Elsewhere
                            France continues to count friends even if sometimes their action is
                            marked by their pride and by a certain pretentiousness of young
                            countries. Nevertheless, friendship toward the French is a question of
                            fact. Unfortunately, the same type of policy was not followed in other
                            parts of Africa. In the Congo, the Belgians provided little aid and
                            would not leave cadres capable of administering the country. When the
                            blow-up in the Congo occurred, General <persName>De Gaulle</persName>
                            wrote to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            suggesting that an approach through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> should be avoided, that it would be better to have a
                            tripartite action of the U.S., U.K. and France which should exercise a
                            joint pressure on the Belgians and the Congolese to bring about the
                            implementation on both sides of the Belgian Congo Mutual Assistance
                            Treaty, which would have enabled Belgian aid to continue and which would
                            have kept the East out of the Congo as it was not covered by that
                            treaty. Pressure should have been exercised on both sides including the
                            consent of the Belgians to a general independence of the Congo while
                            continuing their technical aid. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>, however, was of a different opinion and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> followed him in an
                            appeal to the U.N. Now what is the U.N.? The U.N. is men like
                            Hammarskjold and Dayal and also troop contingents from Nasser or Ghana.
                            The result of the U.N. action was not the re-establishment of order but
                            rather more disorder than before.</p>

                        <p>However, the situation is getting somewhat better at present. There is a
                            slight improvement. It seems that the Congolese want to create a real
                            government under Kasavubu with a Parliament and an Army. They can,
                            however, get little help from the U.N. and it would be better for them
                            to be helped by the three powers mentioned above or even those three
                            powers plus Belgium. The situation is not lost, especially if such a
                            direct contact may be established. There is no evolution toward
                            Communism. Of course, there is Gizenga but the people do not seem to
                            follow in the direction of Communism and will not if they receive
                            help.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Angola, however, is more serious. The President asked if
                            General <persName>De Gaulle</persName> would have preferred a tripartite
                            intervention rather than an intervention by the U.N.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>De Gaulle</persName> answered that two interventions
                            would not have had the same character and there would have been no
                            question of a military intervention by the three powers but rather a
                            pressure on the Congolese, including <persName corresp="#p_LP3"
                                >Lumumba</persName> (who at that time had not yet decided to throw
                            his lot with the Communists). If the Belgians had carried out the
                            agreement between the two countries, means could have been found to
                            obtain a cooperation between them and even for preventing the Belgians
                            from what they had attempted in Katanga and making them generally
                            recognize the independence of the Congo without withdrawing their
                            technicians who are necessary for the life of the country.</p>

                        <p>This paper attempts to develop a general framework to help guide our
                            future African aid efforts in four of its aspects: (1) East-West
                            competition; <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0323"/>(2) aid
                            coordination; (3) regional vs. country programs; and (4) economic

                            <item><p>Despite our repeated affirmation that the task of US economic
                                    assistance “is not to negatively fight communism,” our present
                                    African aid policies appear in practice to have an unnecessarily
                                    defensive cast. Although we slowly are beginning to recognize
                                    the limitations of bloc aid as an instrument of political
                                    influence, we continue to be overly concerned with maneuvers to
                                    outbid bloc aid offers or to keep the newly independent African
                                    states from accepting bloc aid. As a result, we are in danger of
                                    undermining the effectiveness of our aid effort for short-term
                                    political considerations, and thereby jeopardizing our longer
                                    term goals of promoting African economic development.</p>
                                <p>Aside from the questionable assumptions underlying preoccupation
                                    with precluding or containing bloc aid to Africa, we should
                                    recognize that such a policy, even if we were prepared to
                                    shoulder the costs involved, will be self-defeating. It seems
                                    quite clear that the newly independent African states, with few
                                    exceptions, are prepared to accept economic aid regardless of
                                    the source, provided no strings are attached. At the same time
                                    the bloc seems bound and determined to expand the scale of its
                                    economic activities in Africa. We no longer can expect to keep
                                    Africa as an almost exclusive Western preserve. Therefore,
                                    instead of futilely trying to outbid bloc aid offers, we should
                                    concentrate on trying to limit their political impact. This
                                    calls for the carrying out of a more vigorous and imaginative
                                    aid effort in Africa responsive to the peoples' fundamental
                                    needs to demonstrate that “economic growth and political
                                    democracy can develop hand in hand.”</p>
                                <p>Of equal if not greater importance than economic aid in
                                    countering bloc influence in Africa, particularly in the years
                                    immediately ahead, is the need to demonstrate to Africans that
                                    the United States is truly a disinterested friend and that we
                                    genuinely and fully support their aspirations to run their own
                                    affairs free from outside interference.</p></item>

                            <item><p>We need to intensify our present efforts to develop closer aid
                                    coordination with other aid donors in Africa. At the present
                                    time more than a dozen Western countries and multilateral aid
                                    organizations are providing Africa well over one billion dollars
                                    of aid annually. The effectiveness of this substantial aid
                                    effort could be increased materially through closer coordination
                                    and consultation among these many donors. We should press
                                    actively to make the Development Assistance Committee (<gloss

                                    purpose.</p>
                                <p>Among other things, we should seek to develop in the <gloss
                                        target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> a Western consensus regarding
                                    aid objectives and aid criteria for Africa; and to ensure that
                                    all bilateral and multilateral assistance efforts are fitted
                                    into carefully prepared long-range country or regional economic
                                    development plans.</p>
                                <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0324"/>
                                <p>At the same time we should continue our efforts through offers of
                                    financial assistance and other means to encourage Africans to
                                    take more initiative and assume greater responsibility in
                                    planning their economic development. To minimize the risks of
                                    being accused of meddling in their internal affairs we should
                                    seek to provide whatever assistance African countries may need
                                    in formulating and executing their development plans through
                                    international organizations or private foundations. In addition,
                                    we might encourage the creation of an Inter-African board of
                                    experts, such as is now being considered for Latin America, to
                                    review these plans and provide assistance in seeking out the
                                    necessary external financing. Arrangements also should be made
                                    for regular consultation between representatives of the <gloss

                            <item><p>As a result of extreme political fragmentation, among other
                                    things, few African states possess the human and natural
                                    resources required to satisfy their leaders' aspirations for
                                    economic development. In recognition of this fact most African
                                    leaders have spoken out in favor of larger regional economic
                                    groupings. We should continue our efforts to encourage such
                                    arrangements without, however, making it appear they are merely
                                    tools of the West.</p>
                                <p>Among other things, the West should make known that it is
                                    prepared to provide substantial aid funds for investment in
                                    basic fields of infrastructure to regional associations large
                                    enough to offer the prospect of satisfactory economic growth.
                                    Some sort of regional African Economic Development Banks or aid
                                    consortia might be useful instruments for this purpose. In
                                    addition, we and other Western industrialized countries should
                                    investigate the possibilities of providing African regional
                                    economic groupings as well as other less developed areas
                                    significant one-way trade concessions for their exports. This
                                    will help demonstrate that the West is not trying to perpetuate
                                    the old colonial system through imperial preferences and like
                                    arrangements and at the same time will help keep the newly
                                    independent African countries in the Western system.</p></item>

                            <item>Finally, the US should be cautious about making multi-year aid
                                commitments to African states. Once such commitments are made, it
                                will be difficult to hold back on them because of unsatisfactory
                                performance by the aid recipient without causing serious political
                                friction and ill-will. In addition, we should guard against creating
                                the impression, as a result of our emphasis on planning, desirable
                                as it may be, that if a country comes forward with a
                                well-thought-out economic development plan we are prepared to
                                provide all of the required external financing.</item>

                                    >Williams</persName></hi>: We have thoroughly reviewed and
                            discussed with your staff the draft paper on “U.S. Policy on Arms Supply
                            to Tropical Africa” which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1"
                                >Bowles</persName> sent to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> in his letter of May 3, 1961,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d197fn1"><ref target="#d193">Document 193</ref>.</note> and
                            fully agree with you that our military assistance policy in Africa
                            should contribute toward limiting the armed forces of the independent
                            African countries to legitimate internal security needs, if possible. We
                            have, however, a number of suggestions for changes which we believe will
                            clarify points open to misinterpretation, particularly by people
                            operating in the field. We believe, for example, that a clear statement
                            of assumptions, by showing the rationale behind some of the stated
                            conclusions, helps assure a single coherent interpretation of the
                            intended policies. These proposed changes also reflect fresh insights on
                            military assistance and other African problems gained during my recent
                            trip with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>. I enclose a
                            copy of the State draft marked with our suggested revisions,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d197fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> and, in addition,
                            a complete redraft setting forth the same basic views in a different
                            format which we believe to state the policy guidance in a manner more
                            useful for operating purposes.</p>
                        <p>Discussions between our respective staffs indicate that we agree on
                            almost all substantive issues, but there are three primary areas where
                            we believe clarification of State language is highly desirable. First is
                            the question of whether the U.S. should ever take the initiative in
                            eliciting requests for military assistance from African governments.
                            Clearly this will sometimes be highly desirable, for example where
                            otherwise the Bloc would supply military assistance or where such
                            assistance will help stabilize an otherwise unstable internal political
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Second is the question of whether we should “discriminate between
                            countries … in the matter of arms supply according to their political
                            behavior.” The language in paragraph 10 of your draft suggests that we
                            should not, although your staff agrees, citing language elsewhere in the
                            draft, that this implication is not really intended. Presumably neither
                            of us would favor supplying arms to a country which is clearly expecting
                            to use them (perhaps in conjunction with arms from the Bloc) for
                            aggression against its neighbors.</p>
                        <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0326"/>
                        <p>The third question is the meaning of “maximum civilianization” in your
                            Conclusion No. 4. We interpret it to mean that, consistent with sound
                            internal security objectives, military assistance should also have a
                            capability to contribute to economic and social betterment, and that the
                            public evidences of U.S. military participation in the military
                            assistance program should be minimized.</p>
                        <p>The State paper makes certain presumptions about U.S. policy for regional
                            arms control (e.g., the opening paragraph, paragraph 8 and Conclusion
                            No. 1) which seem to pre-judge this issue which I understand is
                            presently being examined separately. We are in strong agreement with you
                            that it is desirable to minimize the military capability of the African
                            States to do anything more than maintain internal security. On the other
                            hand, the technique of regional arms control is one which bears
                            examination in depth to assure that the principles and terms of any such
                            arrangement will not have far-reaching and adverse consequences on the
                            U.S. and allied military posture, which, as you know, depends heavily
                            upon certain bases and installations in Africa, as well as its
                            consequences as a precedent elsewhere and upon the U.S. position in
                            East-West disarmament discussions. Therefore, we think that statements
                            on this subject should be deferred until the study now in process has
                            been completed.</p>
                        <p>I also note that your staff is currently preparing a message which will
                            elicit a comprehensive study of the arms supply problem by African
                            posts. Replies to this message, which will bear directly on the various
                            policy questions at issue, are to be received by 15 September. These
                            replies should be taken into consideration before a final articulation
                            of arms policy for tropical Africa is made.</p>
                        <p>We have attempted to clarify the State draft statement of policy in the
                            foregoing and certain other respects. However, I should appreciate your
                            sympathetic consideration of our proposed alternative statement of
                            policy. In view of the substantial concurrence of views evidenced in
                            staff consultations between our two Departments, I would hope that we
                            can work out and issue a statement of U.S. policy on arms supply to
                            tropical Africa which will be mutually satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                            <item>The newly independent African states have not yet developed
                                consistent patterns of relationships among themselves. The problems
                                of political survival and of the maintenance of law and order have
                                kept African leaders from concentrating on their interrelationships.
                                Pan-Africanism, disagreements between “radicals” and “conservative”
                                leaders, and the external influences of the Communist Bloc, the
                                former Metropoles and the US add conflicting and complicating
                                factors to the situation. (Paras. 7-10, 12)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Pan-Africanism is a mystical concept, glorifying racial kinship
                                and the African personality and culture. Its chief target is
                                “neo-colonialism,” its eventual goal is African unity. No black
                                African leader can afford to reject these concepts and all of them
                                to some degree assert Pan-Africanist ideals. But the more radical
                                leaders, such as <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>, have found the
                                slogans of Pan-Africanism especially useful in their efforts to
                                extend their influence and build up their followings. (Paras.

                                    >Balewa</persName>, Houphouet-Boigny and Youlou, prefer
                                postponing the issue of political integration. In addition, they
                                wish to gain the material benefits which the maintenance of close
                                ties with the former Metropoles have so far assured them. (Paras.

                                is likely to develop into a real federation. Broader groupings such
                                as the Casablanca powers (mainly radical) and the Monrovia group
                                (mainly conservative) have yet to show any basic cohesion. It is
                                possible that the African states may be able to create some
                                functional organs for economic cooperation. It is also possible that
                                some efforts will be initiated to create broad regional machinery to
                                enable African states to settle their own disputes. (Paras.

                            <item>On the whole, African regional relationships are likely to remain
                                fluid over the next several years. During this period, we believe
                                opportunism is likely to prove more compelling to African leaders
                                than ideology, and that there will almost certainly be frequent
                                shifts and recombination of coalitions as African leaders vie for
                                power and international status. Nevertheless, we anticipate that
                                Pan-Africanism will gain support, at least as a visionary
                                proposition, and that the militant anticolonialism of the
                                Pan-Africanists will induce more moderate leaders to adopt
                                neutralist foreign policies. (Paras. 37-39, 45)</item>

                            <item>Western European cultural and economic influence in Africa will
                                probably remain at a relative high level over the next several
                                years, but Africans will increasingly look elsewhere for aid. The US
                                is regarded as an alternate source of foreign assistance, but one
                                which does not fully understand Africa's problems or fully support
                                African aspirations. The Bloc will probably have considerable
                                success in increasing its influence with African states and in
                                promoting neutralist foreign policies, and it will encourage the
                                emergence of additional radical regimes. African leaders will try to
                                play East and West against the other and to extract the maximum
                                amount of aid and assistance from both side. (Paras. 24-30)</item>

                                    P. Bundy noted that the difficulty with the <gloss

                                    the very countries where the United States could use a <gloss
                                        target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> service to best advantage
                                    were also those where it had not yet been able to establish its
                                    constructive interest in their stability, welfare, and
                                    development. Therefore, the United States needed to go to such
                                    countries with a proposal that was clearly to their own
                                    advantage as well as to that of the United States. Penfield
                                    suggested reconsideration of the question in 6 months, by which
                                    time it would be possible to assess developing attitudes,
                                    especially in West Africa. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                    770.5411/1-3161)</note> In particular, these comments point out
                                that a major obstacle which must be overcome will be the obtaining
                                of permission of the many countries involved for the introduction of
                                US military personnel and equipment. This may prove difficult since
                                the advantages which will accrue to these countries by the

                            <item>In view of the above, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the

                                Staff have developed the attached plan for an African “Embassy Run”
                                which is designed to provide the specific information

                                This plan, which would provide <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss>
                                service to twelve principal embassies on a weekly basis, is

                                however, before implementation to identify and resolve the many
                                problems inherent to an operation of this type.</item>

                            <item>It will be noted that the tariff proposal contained within this
                                plan would charge Special Assignment Aircraft (<gloss

                                initially since specific route requirements are unknown. Once these
                                route requirements have been established, it may be possible to
                                designate the route as channel traffic and revert to normal channel

                                which an Embassy Run of this type would offer. In this regard, the
                                Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the strongest advantage is the
                                fact that the proposed <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> routes
                                would provide a readily available transportation means to facilitate
                                the introduction and support of those US programs designed to assist
                                the cultural and economic development of the countries involved and
                                to provide the various forms of medical aid and health education.
                                Similarly, these routes would facilitate the provision of military
                                aid to those countries participating in the Military Assistance
                                Program. Combining the stated desire on the part of the United
                                States to make such varied programs available to these countries
                                with the use of scheduled <gloss target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss>
                                airlift in these programs should provide a persuasive argument for
                                permitting initiation of such air service to the countries selected.
                                Additionally, it could be pointed out to these countries that <gloss
                                    target="#t_MATS1">MATS</gloss> service of this type would
                                provide a means for the United States to respond to the expressed
                                needs of the African nations on a timely, yet orderly, basis. Such a
                                capability would be especially desirable in rendering assistance in

                        <p>I am greatly disturbed by two developments in connection with our aid
                            program for Africa for this year. I am calling them to your attention
                            because of the serious political consequences that they may have. Both
                            relate to attitudes that we find widespread in the new task forces and
                            informal groups that are reviewing our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1962 programs.</p>

                            <item><p>First, there seems to be considerable sentiment for deferring
                                    the implementation of many of our projects—a view that we should
                                    hold back a substantial portion of the limited funds available
                                    to us to permit further program reviews and to allow for the
                                    consideration of requirements that may arise later this year. If
                                    this view prevails, it may be catastrophic for our relations
                                    with Africa. In the best of circumstances, we must expect a
                                    great deal of disappointment at the quantity of aid and the
                                    speed at which it is made available. The pronouncements of the
                                    President, in particular, have raised widespread expectations.
                                    But I hope we will be able to live with the disappointment if we
                                    move forward promptly with whatever funds we have, demonstrating
                                    at least our good will and genuine effort to be of
                                    assistance.</p>
                                <p>I am concerned, too, that in Africa, where our program is largely
                                    a new one and where we have relatively little record of
                                    accomplishment to which we can point, that further delay (three
                                    months of the fiscal year have already passed) will mean facing
                                    the Bureau of the Budget, and then the Congress, with almost
                                    nothing done. Despite our tremendous needs, we will inevitably
                                    be told that we must have had little use for funds in Africa,
                                    thus weakening the Administration's position in <gloss
                                        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963.</p></item>
                            <item>Second, I am concerned by what appears to be a disposition to
                                agree to the expenditure of funds in a few countries to the neglect
                                of a great many. I fully support the concentration of the bulk of
                                our funds and argued strongly for this principle before the
                                Congress. But it is a perhaps unfortunate fact of political life
                                that we must have some program—usually a very modest one—in
                                virtually every country in Africa. We simply cannot, at the

                                on the former colonial power, unless we wish to weaken seriously
                                whatever moderate leadership exists.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This is by no means solely a political requirement. Even small sums,
                            expended in carefully selected projects, can often be of great economic
                            value. Many of these countries need help simply to get them to the point
                            where they have the capacity to consider self-help measures of the kind
                            the President has outlined. Assisting them makes sense both for them and
                            for us.</p>
                        <p>We may already be too late in Africa with too little. Further delay and
                            the lack of a balanced effort could do tremendous damage to our
                            position. It is imperative that we do something to preserve for Africa

                        <p>We hereby respectfully submit our views on what we believe the United
                            States can and should do to prevent or moderate wasteful and dangerous
                            military build-ups in Africa.</p>
                        <p>We are pleased that you are giving this matter serious thought at this
                            time. Our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that the dangers
                            of an excessive arms build-up are very real indeed. African leaders are
                            already showing signs of wishing to possess significant military power,
                            partly as a symbol of their newly won independence. The Communist Bloc
                            has surplus arms and is eager to supply them to Africans as a means of
                            creating chaos and of spreading Communist influence.</p>
                        <p>Now, while the arms slate in Africa is still fairly clean, is the time to
                            begin making whatever contribution we can to preventing the ills that
                            inevitably arise when nations enter into unbridled arms

                            <p>There is little if any present prospect for success in efforts to
                                impose arms control on Africa from the outside.</p>
                            <p>We must find ways of stimulating the Africans themselves to take the
                                initiative in working toward effective arrangements for arms
                                limitation.</p>
                            <p>This requires a discreet but purposeful educational program directed
                                to African leaders and other opinion-formers. This is a long-range
                                program—and a start should be made as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>U.S. officials responsible for African problems, both in Washington
                                and in the field, must be made thoroughly aware of the fact that a
                                major U.S. interest is to bring arms build-ups in Africa under some
                                degree of control.</p>
                            <p>Restraints in military build-ups should be a major aim of U.S.
                                African policy. Such restraints involve a broad spectrum of
                                questions, from U.S. supply of arms to meet legitimate
                                requirements—to the possibility of “educating” the Africans in the
                                necessity for restraint—to the possibility of some agreed arms
                                limitation arrangements to prevent or moderate arms races in
                                Africa—to the concept of general disarmament.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. should continue to support its previous initiatives in this
                                field such as the one put forward at the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> in 1960.</p>
                            <p>Additional major public pronouncements on this subject may, however,
                                be unhelpful. Our principal effort should be to encourage African
                                leaders to become active in this field. One African zealot on arms
                                limitation could be worth ten American and other non-African
                                advocates of that cause.</p>
                            <p>U.S. arms supply policy can, if properly conceived, contribute to our
                                arms limitation objectives. A responsible U.S. arms supply program
                                that helps to meet legitimate requirements offers worth-while
                                opportunities for exerting a wholesome influence on African
                                political and military leaders.</p>

                            <p>In general, in the case of the newly independent African countries it
                                would be better to have non-uniformed and non-service technical
                                military experts at our Embassies, rather than military attaches.
                                Where we have attaches, they, too, must be imbued with the arms
                                limitation philosophy.</p>
                            <p>The U.K. and France have large interests in the matter of African

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Alex</hi>: We are giving continuous attention
                            to the specific steps to be taken should the national interest require
                            military operations by United States forces in sub-Saharan Africa. A
                            critical aspect of this problem is the timely movement of combat and
                            support elements into the area. We may also need to use recovery bases,
                            other than the strike-staging facilities, subsequent to air operations.
                            Such movements would involve overflight, landing, and operational rights
                            which we do not presently enjoy. I believe it is important, if we are to
                            be in position for effective action if an emergency arises, to set forth
                            now the scope of our needs in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Military operations in sub-Saharan Africa, as contemplated in current
                            contingency plans, would require the use of combat units from the United
                            States. In an emergency situation, the bulk of such a force would have
                            to be deployed by air. There is attached a description of the routes we
                            expect to use for deployment if the emergency were to arise in the
                            Republic of the Congo, indicating also the new overflight, landing, and
                                <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>operational rights which
                            these routings involve.<note n="1" xml:id="d203fn1">Attached to the
                                source text but not printed is an appendix entitled “Planned Routes
                                for Emergency Deployment to the Republic of the Congo.”</note> As
                            plans for contingency operations elsewhere in Africa are developed,
                            additional overflight rights and terminal operating rights would be
                            needed, although the approach routes to sub-Saharan Africa would remain
                            largely unchanged.</p>
                        <p>These deployment plans are based upon technical military considerations.
                            We realize that political circumstances limit our capability for
                            obtaining assurance now that these deployment routes will be fully
                            available. We hope, however, that you will find the attachment a basis
                            for as much advance action as is politically feasible, for advance
                            planning which would save valuable time in an emergency situation, and
                            for comment on political factors which should be taken into account in
                            planning military deployments to sub-Saharan Africa.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d203fn2">On December 1, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
                                for Politico-Military Affairs Jeffrey Kitchen responded to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>' request for comment on
                                political factors that should be taken into account in planning
                                military deployments to sub-Saharan Africa. Kitchen's letter
                                emphasized the political difficulties involved in attempting to
                                secure prior overflight, landing, and operational rights from
                                appropriate African nations, which would raise undue alarm
                                concerning U.S. intentions in the area and prejudice continued
                                maintenance of current U.S. base rights in Morocco and Libya. The
                                Department of State therefore recommended that the basic assumptions
                                underlying U.S. unilateral military contingency plans for these
                                areas be revised to reflect these political considerations.

                            I.]</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. SOVIET PENETRATION OF GUINEA, MALI AND GHANA</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> stated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were concerned about the trend
                            of political developments in Guinea, Mali and Ghana. Mr. Johnson <pb
                                n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0337"/>said that he understood this
                            concern and that he wished to make a few introductory remarks before
                            turning the discussion over to Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName>. He pointed out that these countries were very
                            new ones and that they were feeling their way in the world. Under the
                            circumstances it is inevitable that they will swing to and fro like a
                            pendulum in their political leanings. None of them wish to be satellites
                            or vassals of Moscow although they could be unwittingly trapped into
                            such a position. Mr. Johnson said that at the moment Guinea was
                            beginning to swing back to the right from an extreme left position; Mali
                            is swinging to the left while there are signs that Ghana will soon begin
                            a swing back to the right. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> then made the following comments on the status
                            of developments in the three countries.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mali</hi>—The ruling party organization in Mali
                            controls the actions of the President, and the party is inclined further
                            to the left than is he. We are concerned about a possible drift to the
                            left but are not yet ready to conclude that an irreversible movement in
                            that direction is clearly underway. It is our judgment that leaders in
                            Mali are emotionally and psychologically closer to the Soviet bloc than
                            to the West, but at the same time they intend to balance their
                            commitments and avoid undue dependence on either side. As their maturity
                            develops, we hope that Mali's leaders will come to realize that the
                            U.S., and the West as a whole, are not hostile to their genuine
                            aspirations for the future development of the new African states.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Guinea</hi>—President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> has publicly accused “Marxist Leninist” groups and
                            their operating centers in Dakar, Paris and Moscow of attempting to
                            overthrow his government. He has expelled the Soviet Ambassador to
                            Guinea, and the Guinean Ambassador to the U.S. has advised the
                            Department confidentially that his government possesses documentary
                            proof that Bloc embassies have been behind the recent difficulties in
                            Guinea. We believe that these recent events will strengthen Guinea's
                            desire to reduce its dependence on the Bloc and thus present us with
                            increased opportunities over the months to come.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ghana</hi>—We feel that our decision to assist in the
                            financing of the Volta dam project will be helpful through insuring U.S.
                            presence in Ghana and as a demonstration of U.S. interest in the future
                            of Ghana. We also consider that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s Pan-African ambitions will prevent him from
                            going completely under control of the East or the West. The Peace Corps
                            program in Ghana has been highly successful in its first stages, and the
                            Government of Ghana has requested that additional Peace Corps volunteers
                            be assigned.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> stated that the
                            political situations in the three countries appeared to be improving.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> asked if grant aid
                            provision of transport aircraft to Guinea would help to improve our
                            position there. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                            said that he felt that this would be <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                facs="0338"/>helpful at an appropriate time. He pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> had been advised to let
                            us know at any time if we could be of help to him, and he had replied
                            that he would discuss this offer with us in the near future. Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> also noted that the
                            gift airplanes which the President has provided to various African Heads
                            of State have been very well received. Mr. NITZE remarked that the U.S.
                            Ambassador to Guinea had recommended that U.S. assistance in local road
                            building projects would be helpful. Mr. Ferguson said that we would
                            consider this important project when and if <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> turns to us for aid.</p>

                                increasing. Unless this trend is checked, Communist dominance could

                                Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, an evaluation of intelligence reports does
                                not indicate a conclusion that significant changes in the current
                                situation in these three countries should be expected. The recent

                                Guinea in removing the Soviet Ambassador, and the attempted coup

                                Marxist organized countries is limited to what might be considered
                                correct diplomatic representation with some small opportunities in
                                the social, economic, and information areas. US military presence is
                                limited to an Army attache in Accra, and a small mission staffed by
                                the US Army in Mali which has been under pressure to leave. Our
                                military presence in Guinea is nil. All these countries have shown
                                interest of varying degrees in social, economic, and arms assistance
                                from Western sources but have actually accepted little. The most

                                three countries have taken place in Ghana. In addition to the Volta
                                Dam project which the United States has agreed to finance, there are
                                both British and Canadian training missions in Ghana and the
                                Ghanaians have purchased Canadian Caribou aircraft. Recent
                                information from Accra indicates that Ghana has secured the services
                                of a Pakistani general officer to serve as deputy to the Chief of
                                the Ghana Defense Staff and that the Ghanaians have requested
                                Pakistan to make six artillery officers available to serve with the
                                Ghana army. Mali has made some tentative soundings for additional
                                military material. Despite Guinea's growing disenchantment with the
                                Communist Bloc, new concrete opportunities in that country have yet
                                to materialize.</item>

                                Ghana, Guinea, and Mali, will necessarily depend primarily on the
                                assessment by the Department of State of the political advantages to
                                be gained by US military assistance. Because of the need to make
                                certain that US assistance does not simply reinforce a
                                Communist-oriented regime already in power, frequent reviews should
                                be made of all US operations in each country to ascertain the extent
                                to which specific US political objectives have been achieved or are
                                in the process of achievement.</item>

                            <item>In view of the foregoing, it may be readily concluded that
                                prospects for expansion of our influence will be slow. Moreover, it
                                is unlikely to accelerate if our readiness to help remains a one-way
                                street with the United States essentially “begging” to be allowed to
                                help. Nearby are the friendly, Western oriented countries of
                                Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal and the Conseil de l'Entente
                                countries. Accelerated efforts to be responsive to the military aid
                                requirements of these more deserving countries could be the catalyst
                                which might render Ghana, Guinea, and Mali more receptive. Moreover,
                                it is in our interest to foster and strengthen the viability of
                                these countries in any event, as geographically, culturally, and
                                ethnically, they dilute the potential of a Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union
                                and can exert a moderating influence on their radical policies.
                                Therefore, it appears timely and logical to expand our activities in
                                these countries while selectively exploiting such opportunities as
                                may arise to enhance our position in Ghana, Guinea, and Mali.</item>

                            introduced, and renewed their expression of interest in securing two
                            Boeing 720B's, high-level consultations between <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> and the Department, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>], produced a new proposal to
                            the Sudanese based on two elements: 1) the immediate despatch to
                            Khartoum of the Vice President of Seaboard International Airlines to
                            discuss the possibilities of developing Sudan Airways, including the
                            obtaining on favorable terms of additional equipment best suited to
                            Sudan airlines needs; 2) notification that the US Government was
                            prepared to consider favorably a loan application for financing
                            Khartoum-Port Sudan Road best suited to the Sudan's needs after the
                            recently completed survey had been considered by that Government. We
                            further informed the Sudanese that our willingness to assist the Sudan
                            can be significantly influenced by a decision to proceed with the air
                            agreement which would be viewed by Congress and the American public as
                            assisting <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> penetration of
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>As a result of these representations, the Sudanese Government agreed on
                            April 29 to hold off making a final decision for 10 to 14 days, “or even
                            longer.” Discussions with the Seaboard representative are continuing and
                            the relatively favorable Sudanese reaction to his proposal, just
                            received, indicates a further period of postponement while the Seaboard
                            offer is examined.</p>
                        <p>Even before the accelerated Soviet efforts to expand their air routes in
                            Africa, there had been within various parts of the US Government concern
                            that US policies with respect to civil aviation in developing countries
                            were not being properly coordinated among the various interested
                            agencies of Government and were not taking sufficient account of
                            political and security requirements. A Department of Defense study of
                            September 1, 1961 discussed this problem and made a number of useful
                            proposals for making aviation in the less-developed countries a more
                            responsive instrument of foreign policy. Within the Department of State
                            one principal difficulty seemed to be that civil aviation matters were
                            handled entirely within the Bureau of Economic Affairs by the Office of
                            Transportation and Communications, and as a result political
                            consideration of aviation policies was not achieved on a systematic
                            basis or often at a high enough level. As a partial solution to this
                            problem, efforts are <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0345"/>underway
                            to obtain the services of a highly qualified professional in the civil
                            aviation field. The leading candidate for this position is Mr. Joseph
                            Fitzgerald, now President of the Ozark Airlines, St. Louis, and formerly
                            Chief of the International Division of <gloss target="#t_CAB1"
                                >CAB</gloss>. Mr. Fitzgerald will be coming to Washington for an
                            interview on May 11.</p>
                        <p>As a first step to arrange closer consultation among those Government
                            agencies chiefly concerned, you wrote on May 1 to Defense, <gloss

                                target="#t_CAB1">CAB</gloss> proposing an early meeting to discuss
                            arrangements for some form of ad hoc inter-Agency consultation to
                            discuss steps to counteract Soviet Bloc penetration of the developing
                            countries through aviation activities as well as to assure a
                            constructive response to the aviation aspirations of these
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>As an important element for devising a coherent civil aviation
                            development policy in Africa, the Advisory Group might consider the
                            initiation of thorough surveys of individual countries in order to
                            develop broad guidelines applicable throughout particular regions in
                            Africa. Existing associations such as Air-Afrique and Springbok could be
                            strengthened and the establishment of new regional airlines, for example
                            in the Maghreb, should be explored. One of the elements of difficulty
                            will be in preserving harmonious relationships with the former
                            Metropoles which would, no doubt, resist any massive intrusion of US
                            aviation competition. One proposal suggested by Mr. James Smith is to
                            consider the aviation maintenance and support system separately from the
                            operations of the airlines themselves and to promote, with <gloss
                                target="#t_Exim1">Exim</gloss> Bank participation, a series of
                            consortia for building and controlling all national aviation facilities.
                            In this way the basic aviation development of the country could not come
                            under Soviet influence but would be developed as a cooperative
                            economically viable venture with the West.</p>
                        <p>These and many other interesting proposals, such as those set forth in
                            the <gloss target="#t_FAA1">FAA</gloss>-Defense study just sent over by

                            problem. Our opponent has a strategic plan, a single aviation

                            assistance programs, considerable resources of modern aircraft and
                            technical personnel, no “colonial” heritage in Africa or Latin America
                            and few problems of coordinating its efforts in the developing countries
                            with other members of the Bloc. The Soviets clearly do not intend to let

                            they have broadened their drive for air routes to four additional

                            these facilities to support contingency operations in Africa might be
                            denied or harassed, for political reasons, by the host Governments
                            involved. Accordingly, we attach importance to making arrangements with
                            the United Kingdom under which we could install and operate
                            communications equipment at Ascension Island, when required during
                            contingency operations, and when use of other facilities is not
                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>Such equipment would be used for command and control of forces deployed
                            to Africa and for ship-shore communications coverage of the South
                            Atlantic and the African west coast. The equipment would consist of
                            transportable transmitters and receivers to be airlifted into Ascension
                            Island on approximately 36-hours notice when required. We estimate that
                            about 80 to 120 men would be required for the temporary operation of
                            such facilities, depending upon the type of equipment selected and the
                            extent to which support could be provided by other U.S. activities on
                            the island at the time.</p>
                        <p>There are no current plans for the establishment of permanent
                            communication facilities at Ascension Island, nor for any construction
                            in anticipation of contingency use. Any construction later undertaken in
                            this connection would be the minimum consistent with the circumstances
                            (e.g., the preparatory time available during a contingency, the support
                            available from other U.S. activities at Ascension, and the expected
                            duration of the operations). For the present, the requirement is only to
                            identify and have kept available two suitable sites of 4 to 6 acres
                            each, for receiver and transmitter areas. The former could be co-located
                            with existing Atlantic Missile Range (<gloss target="#t_AMR1"
                                >AMR</gloss>) receivers; the latter would be located and the
                            frequencies used would be selected and coordinated to avoid interference
                            with existing electronic systems on the island.</p>
                        <p>It is relevant to point out that we have examined the possibility of
                            using existing <gloss target="#t_AMR1">AMR</gloss> communications
                            facilities for these purposes. We have concluded that this arrangement
                            would not be practicable. If we rely <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320"
                                facs="0348"/>upon these facilities to carry both <gloss

                            traffic between Ascension Island and the continental U.S., we would be
                            risking serious and untimely interruptions in one or the other of these
                            important activities. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_AMR1">AMR</gloss>
                            facilities are not suitable for the essential relay of contingency
                            operations traffic between Ascension Island and the deployed forces
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>We would appreciate whatever steps you can take to obtain the agreement
                            of the United Kingdom to make sites available on Ascension Island for
                            possible use as described above. As to the form of such an agreement, we
                            have envisaged an exchange of notes authorizing this use of Ascension
                            Island subject to the provisions, insofar as they are applicable, of the

                            <item>Guinea and Mali, along with Ghana, are the main centers of African
                                radicalism south of the Sahara. Their attitudes and policies are
                                dominated <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0349"/>by strong
                                anticolonialism which tends to make them suspicious of the Western
                                Powers and sympathetic with Communist formulas. In domestic policy
                                their approach is militantly nationalistic and revolutionary. In
                                foreign affairs they seek to establish themselves as leaders of
                                radicalism in Africa and to promote policies of neutralism and
                                nonalignment. These policies have given them notoriety and
                                significance out of proportion to their power and resources. (Paras.

                            <item>Radical governments are still in a minority in Africa, but the
                                state of mind reflected in radicalism is present <pb n="322"
                                    xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"/>throughout the continent. At the
                                same time radicalism itself is changing as a consequence of the
                                clash between its theories and practical realities. The trend is
                                toward a blurring of present distinctions and a converging of the
                                radical and moderate viewpoints, with many of the concepts of
                                African radicalism playing an increasingly important role. (Para.

                            <item>Communist influence in both Guinea and Mali has been extensive. It
                                has greatly influenced government organization, the dominant
                                authoritarian parties, and the mass organizations characteristic of
                                political life in both countries. The Communist countries have
                                supplied Guinea since its break with France with the bulk of its aid
                                from outside sources and have also assisted Mali, though the latter
                                country has continued to receive roughly equal amounts from France.
                                The foreign trade of both countries has been substantially
                                reoriented toward the Bloc, although Mali continues to import
                                heavily from the West. The two countries together have more Bloc
                                advisers and technicians than all other sub-Saharan countries put
                                together. (Paras. 9, 21-22, 25, 29-30, 35-37)</item>
                            <label>D.</label>
                            <item>Nevertheless, Guinea and Mali have retained their freedom of
                                action under President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou
                                    Toure</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_KM3">Modibo
                                    Keita</persName>. Each heads a group within the dominant
                                Political Bureau of his party which takes a generally flexible and
                                pragmatic point of view, as opposed to the view of doctrinaire
                                pro-Bloc elements. It appears likely that both Presidents will
                                succeed, at least for the next year or two, in maintaining the
                                dominance of their pragmatic approach, which seeks to maintain
                                contacts with the West to balance those with the Bloc. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KM3">Keita</persName>'s position, however, is much
                                less strong than <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s.
                                Over the past few months there has been in Guinea some
                                disillusionment with Bloc assistance and mounting concern about the
                                political wisdom of relying solely on the Bloc. Mali's reliance on
                                the Bloc is likely to be balanced by continuing relations with the
                                West. (Paras. 16, 33, 40-41)</item>

                            <item>The most significant thing about Guinea and Mali during the period
                                since their independence is that, while they have offered the Bloc
                                the best opportunities it has had in Africa, and while the Bloc has
                                made a vigorous effort to take advantage of them, the two countries
                                are not Communist and are, in fact, maintaining a more or less
                                independent position. We believe that this experience is germane to
                                African radicalism throughout the continent and may serve in a
                                general way as a guide to its probable long-term attitudes,
                                policies, and orientation. (Para. 42)</item>

                        <p>The Soviets are deeply involved in the air operations of Ghana, Guinea,
                            and Mali. Ghana, in particular, has reportedly suffered high financial
                            losses as the result of having too many (eight) expensive-to-operate
                            Soviet turboprop aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The Czech airline has been flying to Egypt and down the west coast of
                            Africa, as well as through Near, South, and Southeast Asia for some
                            time. The Soviets have just concluded a series of air agreements with
                            west Africa countries plus the Sudan. The latter agreement gives
                            Aeroflot routes through eastern Africa to the Malagasy Republic, across
                            central Africa to the west coast and beyond to Latin America.</p>
                        <p>The Czechs also have been flying to Cuba (by way of the U.K., Ireland,
                            and Canada) for some time. Aeroflot is now beginning service to Cuba by
                            way of Conakry, Guinea.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets are likely to be active in many African countries seeking the
                            rights that will allow them to flesh out the routes already obtained.
                            Eventually they will have a permanent network of secure communications.
                            (Had they had such a network two years ago, it might not have been so
                            easy to eliminate them from the Congo.)</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have also publicized the fact that they want routes into, and
                            through, the heart of South America. (Brazil, Bolivia, et cetera.)</p>
                        <p>Although we have been unable to keep the Soviets out of Africa, we want
                            to make every effort to keep them out of South America. If the Latin
                            American countries will cooperate, it should be possible to do so.</p>
                        <p>In the field of technical assistance, a Soviet offer to train Somali
                            pilots has been accepted. Offers of modern Soviet aircraft have been
                            made to Bolivia. Other aid offers will undoubtedly accompany the seeking
                            of landing rights in Latin American countries.</p>

                                powers or in hastening the process; indeed they could even harden
                                the attitude of powers involved. We believe political, legal and
                                moral pressure is best course for immediate future. We have
                                influence which can be used within this context; and we are prepared

                        <p>Senator Ellender's remark that Africans do not have the ability to govern

                                conference in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, Senator Allen J.
                                Ellender of Louisiana said: “My own government, of course, supports
                                the United Nations efforts to make as many of the countries of
                                Africa independent as desired to be, or happen to operate their own
                                government. Now personally I wouldn't have any quarrel with that if
                                those who are to operate the government were competent to do so and
                                had the capability. But I've yet to come to any of them wherein that
                                capability exists and for that reason I stated that the time for
                                this change to independence is a little early, quite early.”

                                call before they come in to see the President.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Alex</hi>: The problem of U.S. military
                            assistance programs in Africa generally has been giving us considerable
                            concern here in Department of Defense for some time. I recognize that
                            the swiftly emerging and changing character of the African states
                            presents especially difficult problems; but it seems to me that our own
                            internal indecision contributes unnecessarily to the difficulty. After
                            many years of experience with military assistance programs, we should
                            now be able to agree on certain guidelines to apply when these same old
                            questions arise in new African states.</p>
                        <p>I would further say that we all can agree that experience has taught us
                            at least the following basic facts: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Military assistance programs must be tailored to fit each
                                    country and are not manageable by any sort of over-all
                                    “regional” organization.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>New programs should not be encouraged except in cases where
                                    clear benefits can be foreseen; but once a decision in principle
                                    is made to provide assistance, it should be done promptly and
                                    vigorously or not at all.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The program should not be attempted if the recipient state
                                    finds it politically or practically impossible to meet our
                                    criteria for administration, auditing, training and control;
                                    including the understanding that a military assistance program
                                    is not simply a gift of equipment but must be a program designed
                                    to accomplish specific internal security or defense aims, and
                                    extending over a period of time.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The U.S. desire to appear forthcoming to the developing states of Africa
                            has apparently led us to make, or imply that we will make, military
                            assistance commitments without a previous decision here that such a
                            program is wise or without making plain our requirements of prospective
                            recipients. It would also appear that no clear-cut policy has fully
                            emerged concerning our attitude with reference to the metropoles of
                            former colonial possessions. We are generally agreed, for example, that
                            we would defer to the metropoles and hope they would carry the military
                            assistance burden; but we have never decided what we should do in event
                            the African state continues to press for assistance but the metropole
                            “voices objection” to our proceeding with a program.</p>
                        <p>The failure to profit from what we have learned over the years in other
                            parts of the world, compounded by the failure to agree to a plan of <pb
                                n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>action when we are caught
                            between conflicting demands of metropoles and African states, have
                            enmeshed us in many problems in the implementation of military
                            assistance to Africa. I have attached some examples of such problems and
                            also attached a draft Department of Defense position for implementation
                            and administration of military assistance to Africa,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d215fn1">Attached but not printed.</note> which is designed
                            to help correct some of the difficulties and deficiencies encountered
                            and to establish a better basis for future programs.</p>
                        <p>The primary concern is to satisfy U.S. objectives and administer the
                            military assistance program in a manner which will reflect credit on the
                            U.S. It is not only essential that these programs be conducted under
                            procedures responsive to the intent and continuing surveillance of
                            Congress, but also in the manner which experience has taught us will
                            make them succeed. If new programs are unable to meet these criteria,
                            then they should be rejected; if a program in existence cannot meet this
                            test, it should be terminated as soon as possible and the funds utilized
                            elsewhere. It seems to me that a full understanding and agreement on the
                            part of all of us in the Government as to our objectives and methods
                            could bring about a rapid solution to present African military
                            assistance problems and preclude the same mistakes in the future.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF AFRICA</p>
                        <p rend="center">Working Paper for Discussion Group Meeting May 25, 1963</p>
                        <p rend="center">Abstract</p>
                        <p>From a global perspective Africa is not an area of primary strategic
                            importance to the US, and we therefore have a strong interest in
                            restricting our involvement in Africa. Nonetheless, we have a
                            considerable number of specific interests and commitments there in whose
                            service we might have to undertake serious and extensive burdens.</p>
                        <p>Our <hi rend="italic">military and technological</hi> needs include: (1)
                            bases in support of our readiness posture; (2) transit and supply points
                            for efforts in the Middle East; (3) overflight and landing rights to
                            implement contingency plans in sub-Saharan Africa; (4) facilities in
                            support of space and missile programs; (5) communications and
                            intelligence facilities; (6) essential raw materials. In general, we
                            will require more military and space facilities in Africa over the next
                            decade, but they will be more difficult to obtain.</p>
                        <p>Our minimum political interests are: (1) to keep Africa free of Communist
                            regimes and to minimize Sino-Soviet influence; (2) to restrain violence
                            in general and preserve the present territorial order as the most
                            feasible alternative to chaos; (3) to prevent violent racial
                            confrontations; and (4) to prevent or control situations of internal
                            chaos similar to the Congo. We have general commitments to act under the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and specific defense
                            commitments to Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Our interests sometimes conflict with each other. There is a basic
                            conflict between our requirements and our desire to limit commitments,
                            which will presumably be resolved on an ad hoc basis. There are a number
                            of more specific conflicts as well, e.g., between our desire to work
                            with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and the difficulty
                            of agreeing with them on fundamental common interests in Africa; and
                            between our desire to draw close <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0360"
                            />to states that show promise of regional leadership and the domestic
                            problems this creates for moderate regimes.</p>
                        <p>We require a basic point of departure which gives proper balance to
                            political and military considerations in light of our overall African
                            posture and which establishes principles for determining future courses
                            of action in response both to our immediate needs and longer-range
                            interests.</p>

                            <item>Experience indicates that the annual costs of the operation
                                envisaged would be around $1.75 million. Based on estimated airlift
                                requirements, the anticipated traffic revenues are expected to
                                offset initially about 65%, or $1.13 million of these costs. The
                                Joint Chiefs of Staff suggest that any deficit which may accrue, now
                                estimated at about $620 thousand, might be absorbed by selective
                                adjustments to the Industrial Fund point-to-point tariff rates

                                justified by the national security policy considerations involved.

                        <p>On June 19, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> sent a Special Message to the Congress on Civil
                            Rights and Job Opportunities. For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public

                            483-496. On the same day, the Department of State sent a series of
                            instructions and information messages to all U.S. diplomatic missions
                            abroad, which included messages from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> and Secretary <persName

                            U.S. civil rights accomplishments. The President's and the Secretary's
                            messages asked U.S. Ambassadors and principal officers to discuss civil
                            rights with foreign governments with candor, but also to affirm U.S.
                            accomplishments and to highlight the positive commitment set by the
                            President toward the goal of equal opportunity for all. (<persName

                        <p>On July 8, Deputy Special Assistant to the President <persName

                            Department of State's “Status Report of African Reactions to Civil
                            Rights in the United States” to <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>, noting that the report was a roundup of African
                            reactions to the President's civil rights messages and the related
                            material sent out to the Embassies. The <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338"
                                facs="0366"/>evaluation section of the report stated: “Responses
                            from African posts indicate that ensuing direct diplomatic approaches at
                            the highest levels produced a greater understanding of United States
                            efforts and that the approaches were appreciated. The nuances of US
                            federal impediments to progress were more greatly appreciated than
                            before, but still not comprehensively so. By contrast, the President's
                            words and the President's actions were clearly understood and
                            appreciated. Several posts report that this sympathetic understanding of
                            the President's actions by African leaders overlays a latent,
                            unexpressed concern by both officials and the public which could become
                            articulate if the situation worsens.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Our greatest asset in dealing with the Africans has been their conviction
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s
                            Administration was committed to eliminating racial discrimination in
                            this country. The Africans will be looking for early reassurance in both
                            word and deed that the new Administration is equally committed. Passage
                            this year of the civil rights legislation now pending in the Congress
                            would be a major triumph in United States relations with Africa.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> had established
                            close personal relations with many African leaders including such
                            militant nationalists as Ben <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>
                            a of Algeria, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> of Ghana and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> of Guinea. These
                            relations enabled the late President to apply personal influence on a
                            number of African problems. By deciding to utilize his responses to
                            messages of condolences to emphasize the continuity of United States
                            policy, President Johnson will signal to Africa his willingness to
                            assume these personal relations. The President could further evidence
                            his intentions in connection with Kenya's impending independence on
                            December 12 by designating the Attorney General to head the United
                            States Delegation to the independence celebrations and by receiving
                            Prime Minister Ken-yatta when the latter comes to the United States on
                            the occasion of Kenya's admission to the United Nations. The inclusion
                            of African leaders (e.g. President Azikiwe of Nigeria) in the 1964
                            program of state and official visits would also serve the same
                            purpose.</p>

                        <p>Despite efforts to prevent it, we may be faced in next few days with a
                            critical choice in the United Nations Security Council of (a) abstaining
                            and thereby possibly permitting adoption of an anticipated Afro-Asian
                            resolution of sanctions against South Africa (probably including oil
                            embargo) or (b) casting our first veto in the United Nations on a racial
                            issue. It is of utmost importance that we should not choose the veto
                            which would be interpreted as a major shift of United States policy by
                            the new Administration. We have already lost heavily in United Nations
                            influence by taking the lead in seeking to moderate resolutions aimed at
                            South Africa. The United Kingdom, which has much more at stake in South
                            Africa than the United States, must, if necessary, bear the onus of
                            casting the veto if that is the only way out.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Portuguese Africa</hi></p>
                        <p>African pressures for progress toward self-determination in Portuguese
                            Africa are becoming stronger and, in terms of votes in the United
                            Nations, more effective. The United States finds it increasingly
                            difficult to play a moderating role between Portugal and the Africans.
                            The latter will shortly place before the United Nations Security Council
                            and General Assembly resolutions on Portuguese Africa which will again
                            bring this problem to the fore. Additionally, the Fourth Committee of
                            the General Assembly has invited Henrique Galvao, the hijacker of the
                            Portuguese vessel Santa Maria, to appear before it. Portugal has
                            indicated it will request Galvao's extradition as a criminal. Our
                            posture on the African resolutions and our handling of the Galvao
                            problem will be closely examined by the Africans for clues as to the new
                            Administration's position on African nationalism.</p>

                        <p>Guinea is the only African country which went almost all the way to the
                            Bloc and then broke with the Bloc and is moving steadily toward closer
                            relations with the United States. Its government has planned to send a
                            Ministerial delegation to the United States in December to seek economic
                            assistance following the beginning of a retreat from extreme socialism,
                            so as to enable it to continue the healthy liberal economic trend. Since
                            the prestige of President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>
                            and the moderates in his Government depends on the results of this
                            visit, it is important that we be as responsive as possible to their

                        <p>A fragile cease-fire exists along the border between these two North
                            African states. An African solution worked out in meetings at Bamako and
                            Addis Ababa appears to have a reasonable chance to succeed in
                            maintaining the peace. The United States role has been one of impartial
                            efforts to reduce outside intervention and to encourage a solution in an
                            African context. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> personally intervened to these ends. Should
                            fighting break out again, the ramifications could be serious and prompt
                            United States action, including Presidential messages, may be
                            necessary.</p>

                        <p>The aim of the Somali Republic to unite Somalis living in Ethiopia and
                            Kenya has created serious tension in this area. It is further
                            complicated by Somali acceptance of an offer of Soviet military
                            assistance—an evidence of the persisting Soviet intention to probe
                            targets of opportunity in Africa. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> in talks with the Emperor of Ethiopia in October
                            emphasized our interest in stability and peace in this area. Our
                            interests justify pursuing actively efforts to find a modus vivendi
                            between Somalia and its neighbors and to reduce the impact of the
                            obvious Soviet interest in fishing in these troubled waters.</p>

                            aluminum smelter which is to be the main purchaser of Volta River
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Ghana is now sending a delegation headed by Minister of
                            Finance Gbedemah to Washington with the objective of working out the
                            details of the contracts under which World Bank and U.S. financing of
                            the hydroelectric project would be made available. They also want to
                            finalize the draft of the tax treaty between the U.S. and Ghana which is
                            necessary to permit satisfactory operation of Valco.</p>
                        <p>Valco (Volta Aluminum Company) is being organized by <persName
                                corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName>, Alcoa, Reynolds and Olin
                            Mathieson. The total cost of the smelter will be $128 or $178 million
                            according to the size of the smelter to be built. In view of what they
                            believe are unacceptable political risks for private investment in
                            Ghana, given the present pro-Soviet and anti-U.S. policies of the
                            Government of Ghana, these four companies are now asking the U.S.
                            Government for guarantees against all but the commercial risks of the
                            Valco project.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Government is also being asked by a group of aluminum companies
                            headed by Aluminum Ltd. of Canada and including <persName
                                corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> and Reynolds, to guarantee
                            against all but commercial risks a major part of a $162 million
                            investment in the Boke Bauxite Mine in Guinea. Finally, <pb n="342"
                                xml:id="pg_342" facs="0370"/>the U.S. Government has offered last
                            year to update a French made study of a dam on the Konkoure River in
                            Guinea and to participate in the financing of this project. This would
                            involve construction of an aluminum smelter.</p>
                        <p>There is general agreement among Washington officials who have studied
                            the problem that strong political and economic reasons speak in favor of
                            U.S. Government support of the construction of the Volta Dam and of the
                            aluminum companies engaged in the Valco project and the Boke project. It
                            is recognized that a refusal to aid the Volta Project or a withdrawal of
                            the aluminum companies from the Valco smelter would have very
                            undesirable effect on Western relations with Ghana. In the case of Boke,
                            a withdrawal of the Western aluminum companies project would make it
                            possible for the Soviets to create an extremely efficient aluminum
                            production on the basis of what is considered the richest bauxite mine
                            in the world and of the very cheap water power potential of the Konkoure
                            River.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, U.S. guarantees in unprecedented far-reaching terms of
                            the aluminum projects in Ghana and Guinea can only be justified if the
                            terms of investment are such as to give some promise of continued
                            operation. Little permanent benefit can be derived for the U.S. from the
                            Valco and Boke projects unless we make our support of these projects
                            part of a wider program designed to assist the economic growth of West
                            Africa. We also must attempt to create a situation under which it will
                            be more advantageous for the Governments of Ghana and Guinea,
                            politically and economically, to permit these enterprises to continue
                            their operations under Western control rather than to nationalize them.
                            The Under Secretary for Economic Affairs has called for February 21 a
                            meeting of the heads of <gloss target="#t_Exim1">Exim</gloss> Bank,

                                Edward M. Kennedy.</note> in Accra on December 12, 1960, Mr.
                            Gbedemah urged the United States to be more aggressive or it would lose
                            out in Africa. He deplored the progress that the Soviets have already
                            made in Ghana and said that he was finding it increasingly difficult to
                            make his voice heard. In a final conversation with Mr. Penfield on the
                            evening of his departure, Mr. Gbedemah pleaded that you seize the
                            opportunity of your meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> to review with complete frankness the various
                            points of misunderstanding between us. We agree completely with Mr.
                            Gbedemah and suggest you take the conversational initiative at the
                            outset and raise the various matters discussed in the attached talking
                            papers. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> should depart with

                            has been that in private meetings with U.S. officials he adopts a
                            conciliatory and receptive posture; but, all too frequently, he
                            subsequently reverses himself and speaks critically of the West. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> can leave Washington
                            with no illusions as to the firmness of our policies and a clear

                            improve, we will have made a great stride forward. I would suggest an
                            appropriate communique be issued following your meeting, tone and

                        <p>The bulk of the conversation consisted of a monologue on the Congo and
                            related topics by President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>, punctuated by occasional questions by the
                            President and the Secretary. President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> seemed to go out of his way to minimize his
                            differences of view with the United States position. For instance, on
                            his proposal to withdraw diplomatic missions from Leopoldville he said,
                            “why not give it a try? Let them get out for just a month and see if it
                            doesn't make a difference.” (At this point Mr. Adamafio made his only
                            contribution to the conversation, murmuring, “three months.”)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s comments were
                            somewhat rambling and at times repetitious, but he concentrated on two
                            phases of the situation, restoration of law and order, with emphasis on
                            removal of the Belgians, and isolation of the Congo from all outside
                            influences except the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On the first, he expressed the conviction that the indiscipline and
                            terrible excesses of the “Force Publique” could quickly and easily be
                            controlled if Belgian military and para-military personnel were removed
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> made “just a show of force.”
                            He illustrated his point by asserting that the Ghanaian troops in the
                            Kasai had stopped the Gizenga forces at Luluabourg and had then
                            persuaded all the forces there to lay down their arms. He at first
                            maintained that even in Katanga removal of the Belgians should not be
                            too difficult but did not contest the President's explanation of the
                            limitations on United States ability to influence our European allies,
                            Belgium, Portugal or the French on Algeria.</p>
                        <p>On the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> played down his Afro-Asian ideas
                            and emphasized his support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He
                            expressed approval of the February 21 Security Council resolution<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d225fn1">For text of U.N. Resolution S/4722, “United
                                Nations Security Council Authorization of Measures, Including the

                                Occurrence of Civil War in the Congo” adopted on February 21 by a
                                vote of 9 (including the United States) to 0, with 2 abstentions,

                                782-784.</note> and said he had made it clear he did not want his
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech of March 7 to be used as a
                            pretext for reopening a Congo debate. He felt that practically all
                            Afro-Asian states supported Hammarskjold and said he had told Mr.
                            Gromyko in New York that the Soviets should give up their campaign to
                            force him out. He agreed with the President's expression of hope that
                            more general support of the Secretary General would be manifested
                            because if the United States was too far out in front in backing him
                            there was a tendency in some quarters to pin a U.S. label on him.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> implied that his
                            support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has been consistent. He
                            said, for instance, that he had stood alone at the Casablanca
                                Conference<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">The Casablanca Conference

                                3-7, 1961.</note> against withdrawal of <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346"
                                facs="0374"/>troops from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force
                            and had finally succeeded in forcing a compromise under which the
                            participants agreed to await developments for a month before making a
                            decision on withdrawing their contingents. He expressed approval of the
                            work of the <gloss target="#t_CAC1">CAC</gloss> and disapproval of a
                            Security Council meeting in the Congo until the situation there has
                            considerably improved. He was very relaxed about U.S. activities in the
                            Congo and said he saw no objection to U.S. planes and ships operating
                            there as long as they were under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            command.</p>
                        <p>On the internal political situation President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> said he had little hope for constructive results
                            from the Tananarive Conference<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">The
                                Conference of Congolese Authorities met in Tananarive March 8-12,
                                1961.</note> because the Congolese participating could not take any
                            meaningful decisions which would stick. He expressed some contempt for
                            Gizenga's abilities and suitability as a leader but said he is no
                            Communist. He made no comments on other Congolese politicians except a
                            rather casual remark that Kamitatu is a genuine nationalist who might
                            emerge as a real leader. He mentioned elections and the reconvening of
                            Parliament as necessary steps in Congolese political development but
                            appeared very flexible on details, placing his emphasis on the principle
                            that the Congolese themselves should be free to work things out in their
                            own way.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the two Presidents found themselves in agreement on three
                            principal points on the Congo, (1) removal of Belgian military and
                            para-military personnel, (2) neutralization of Congolese military forces
                            and insulation of the Congo against outside influences and military
                            supplies, and (3) freedom for the Congolese to work out their own
                            political development. On the last point the Secretary called attention
                            to our own history to illustrate the importance we attach to the
                            principle that government must be based on consent of the governed. In
                            addition to examples from our early history he cited our important role
                            in assisting Indonesian independence and President Roosevelt's heavy
                            pressure on Churchill, even while we were allies in a world war, in
                            regard to India. There should be no doubt, therefore, in any reasonable
                            mind, that the U.S. would always be basically, and in the long run
                            effectively, on the side of anti-colonialism and independence, whether
                            the problem is Portugal and Angola or France and Algeria or any
                            other.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> exhibited no
                            desire to talk about U.S.-Ghana bilateral relations and at one point
                            turned off the Secretary's attempt to bring up the Volta project.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> did, however,
                            make the point that the U.S. should broaden its view of Africa and look
                            at the continent as a whole, a subject which he said he had raised when
                            he was here in 1958.<note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">For documentation on

                            face in Africa. He cited the resentment inspired in “colonialist”
                            circles by Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>'
                            alleged statement on “Africa for the Africans” in Nairobi<note n="5"

                                    >Williams</persName> told reporters at the Nairobi airport:
                                “America's declared policy of Africa for the Africans means that
                                African people should have self-determination at the speed they
                                want. As far as we are concerned, this is true of the Rhodesian
                                Federation and South Africa.” The Assistant Secretary subsequently
                                explained that by Africans he meant Africans of all races. (Telegram

                                <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> had been given an
                            unfriendly reception by the press in Lagos. The President also expressed
                            his surprise and puzzlement over receipt of a recent personal message
                            from <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> accusing him of
                            complicity in <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName>'s murder.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> seemed
                            sympathetic but offered no very specific advice or comment.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> also made a
                            particular plea to avoid confusing Communism and nationalism in Africa.
                            He said he was told in New York yesterday by an East African who has
                            recently been making speeches in the United States that whenever the
                            speaker mentioned him (<persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>) or
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> favorably, he was
                            accused by his audience of being a Communist. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> emphatically insisted that there
                            is not a single organized Communist party in sub-Saharan Africa. He
                            explained that Ghana practices its own form of socialism which is in
                            reality a mixed economy. To illustrate his problems he said the
                            Government has for some years been subsidizing five British gold mines
                            in Ghana. He could not continue this but neither could he permit the
                            mines to close because of the unemployment problems which would be
                            created. In the end, therefore, the Government had bought up the
                            shares.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of aid, President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s only substantive comment was that aid from the
                            East is much more speedy and simple than that from the West. He gave as
                            an example his efforts to get transportation for Ghanaian troops to the
                            Congo last summer. When he had exhausted all other means he appealed to
                            the Soviet Ambassador and in three days Soviet planes were at his
                            disposal in Accra.</p>

                                that had put him into alignment with the Soviet bloc on a series of
                                issues. Ghana's policy in Africa and in the United Nations had been
                                closely aligned with the Soviets. Within the past month, Ghana had
                                secretly received a large shipment of Soviet bloc arms. <persName

                                845J.2614/ 6-1961)</note> I think it was an excellent idea to ask
                            Prime Minister Diefenbaker to propose a candidate. We have been in touch
                            with our Canadian friends, and I am advised that the Prime Minister is
                            giving this problem his personal attention and hopes to be able to
                            suggest a suitable candidate soon.</p>
                        <p>I have asked my advisers to try to develop some alternative suggestions
                            in the event that others do not prove available. At the same time, we
                            have been in touch with Mr. Eugene Black of the International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development, and I know that he is continuing to look
                            over the field for possible candidates.</p>
                        <p>I am delighted to be able to advise you that all major issues involved in
                            negotiations for the United States Government's share of the financing
                            of the dam and smelter have now been resolved. The United States

                            closing.</p>
                        <p>Of course, as we all appreciate, our signing is contingent upon your
                            bringing your negotiations with the International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development to a successful conclusion.</p>
                        <p>It is a source of satisfaction to me that we have been able to join with
                            your Government in helping to make this great project possible. It is a
                            good omen that this major initial step has been accomplished during the
                            first year of your Republic and it is a satisfaction to me that this was
                            achieved during the first year of my Administration. I send you my

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> has commanded
                            that arrangements be made for 400 officer cadets to be selected as early
                            as possible for training in Russia for the “African High Command.”
                            General Alexander, the Chief of the Ghana Army Defense Staff, has
                            protested to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> in an attempt
                            to dissuade him. Leading Ghanaian officers also are opposed and plan to
                            voice their protests to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> on
                            his return to Ghana. If <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            fails to countermand the order, their opposition might reach the point
                            of revolt or an attempted coup d'etat. Embassy Accra believes <persName

                            Sending Ghanaian cadets to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for

                            />toward providing a wedge for Soviet domination. We have urged the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to make a firm demarche to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> to warn him of this
                            danger in the strongest terms. If the British remain reluctant to make a
                            strong protest, we should do so unilaterally, and should not delay too
                            long or it may become impossible for <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> to reverse his decision. We should emphasize
                            that such training would be a clear indication of Ghana's move away from
                            a position of non-alignment, and may result in pressure from the
                            Congress to hold up on U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>In addition to the foregoing, we now know through the British Embassy
                            that General Alexander has protested to <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>,
                            who continued to be unyielding, acknowledged that it would be difficult
                            to recruit 400 cadets but insisted that he intended to send “some”
                            cadets to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for training.
                            Alexander followed up this initial protest by sending an emissary to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> at Yalta to explain
                            his objections. The emissary reported on his return to Accra that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> now plans on sending
                            only 20 cadets to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at this time
                            with perhaps more to follow later. General Alexander believes it will be
                            difficult to find even 20 qualified candidates. Meanwhile Embassy Accra
                            has reported that the Ghana Ministry of Defense has only about 180
                            applicants for cadet overseas training; that the cadets do not realize
                            the training is to be in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; or
                            that the course will involve about two and one-half years without home
                            leave. The Embassy agrees with General Alexander that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> will be lucky to get 20
                            candidates of the 180 applications, pointing out that the Ghana Military
                            Academy barely got 150 candidates out of 1200 applications.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the foregoing, it appears that the situation is not as
                            bad as we suspected. However, as an officer in the British Embassy here
                            has indicated, even 50 or 60 cadets indoctrinated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for 5 years would create serious
                            problems in the Ghanaian armed forces.</p>
                        <p>I think we must now wait until <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> returns to Accra where, as you know, he will
                            have to face up to a number of problems in addition to this one. We
                            expect him to arrive in Accra on September 16.</p>

                            strikes in the three main towns of Ghana, called initially to protest
                            the government's compulsory savings scheme, reflect widespread public
                            discontent with the <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            government. Government efforts to persuade the strikers to return to
                            work have gone largely unheeded. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>, who has been abroad since July, has thus far
                            ignored urgent pleas from party leaders to return home to deal with the
                            situation personally.</p>

                            control, indicating an unexpected groundswell of popular opposition to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>, some of the more
                            moderate old-guard leaders of the ruling Convention People's Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_CPP1">CPP</gloss>) may be tempted to try to
                            depose him, either by force or by political intrigue. The moderates, who
                            include several cabinet ministers, have been increasingly critical of
                            the President because of his growing reliance on younger left-leaning
                            radicals within the party. The moderates command sizeable followings
                            among the major Ashanti and Ewe tribes, two traditional centers of
                            dissatisfaction with the government. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> would probably use totalitarian methods to
                            suppress any open opposition by the moderates, eliminating in the
                            process most of the pro-Western elements in the <gloss target="#t_CPP1"

                            with <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> will be met with
                            repressive measures, the moderates may see a coup as the only course
                            open to them. Reports of plottings are filtering out of Ghana. In view
                            of the respect the moderates have for <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s political astuteness and his ability
                            heretofore to marshal popular support, it is unlikely that they would
                            attempt a coup without army support. (The police are reportedly loyal to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>.) Ghanaian officers
                            are known to be dissatisfied with the present government, but British
                            officers in command of the Ghana forces will probably caution against
                            the Army's participation in any attempted coup for fear of implicating
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he wanted to give him a
                            quick rundown on the Volta River project. The situation is that we have
                            gone very far in committing ourselves to it. Now we have the problem of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> acting up and also the
                            fact that there is some reason to think final situation may not be
                            stable as it was because there is a strike going on and some trouble out
                            there. What <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> proposes to do
                            is to have Soapy Williams and Abe Chayes and probably Harold Linder go
                            out there the latter part of next week with the statement that since
                            this is such a major project that they want to be satisfied the
                            conditions are such that all the provisions are going to be met before
                            there is any final closing. They will make a complete study of the
                            situation and that will make them come back and in the meantime we will
                            have seen the situation developed there. The Parliament comes back early
                            in October. The President said he supposed we were faced with something
                            a bit like the Aswan Dam situation. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that was what we wanted to avoid. Pres. said
                            that if it is cancelled they will blame everything on us. On the other
                            hand, if we go through with it, everybody will think we are crazy in the
                            Congress and every place else.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that was right. He
                            thought that this formula was probably about the best … The President
                            said we couldn't delay their visit a couple of weeks could we, but
                            announce we are going to do it. He thinks the more time we get, the
                            clearer the situation becomes. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said we could do that. We have one technical
                            problem—we may have to close by November 5 in order to get in under the
                            authority of the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> act which is going
                            out of existence. The President asked how much money are we going to
                            commit of our own. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the
                            total in loans and guarantees would be somewhere in the neighborhood of
                            $240 million. But actually the draw down won't begin for a long time.
                            The draw down on the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> money won't be
                            until next year and on the bulk of the money (which is what goes into
                            the smelter) won't begin until 1965, so that we are not actually laying
                            out money. There are lots of outs for getting out of this thing—on
                            various breaches of covenance all the way down the line.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had given up on him. He wouldn't mind giving them a
                            little aid just to keep the contact, but he thinks he's been
                            unnecessarily difficult with us, considering the effort we've really
                            made about him. As bad as he's been in Belgrade, as well as his desire
                            to send 400 soldiers to Russia—ideally would be to give them some aid
                            but not to <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0384"/>give them that kind
                            of aid. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he thinks what
                            we have to avoid is being in a situation where it appears to all these
                            underdeveloped countries that because he has said some unpleasant things
                            we are terminating a great project. President said on the other hand,
                            these people would much rather have the dough themselves. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed. We ought to delay that
                            decision, he would think, and do it on a basis of saying we are sending
                            these people out to make the check before. If it is cancelled they …</p>
                        <p>President said otherwise, of course, then it comes out in the paper that
                            we are giving Ghana, no matter how it is stretched out, $220 million.
                            This would make us look sort of foolish in view of his statement about
                            supporting others.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said Mollenhoff is writing a
                            story tomorrow to the effect that the thing has been put on ice.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thinks if this mission
                            is announced in the next few days they are going out for the purpose of
                            making a check to make sure that all the financial commitments etc. are
                            going to be met without tying it specifically—</p>
                        <p>President said as long as <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                            he are in touch on it so that we don't go beyond the point of [no]
                            return, then we can see how we go in the next month or six weeks. It
                            could really mess up our foreign aid program by giving him that kind of
                            money when we give others almost nothing.</p>
                        <p>President asked what were we doing on Tanganyika. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had a consortium which we
                            are about to propose through DAG which has German money, our money, and
                            two or three other kinds of money. President said if we decide not to go
                            with them it seemed that we could say it just doesn't make sense to put
                            that kind of money in. Then immediately commit a good percentage of the
                            money to some other African countries. Then at least we wouldn't look
                            like we had pulled the rug out of Africa—just Ghana. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that was a possibility. This
                            fellow might get overthrown in the next couple of weeks and a really
                            solid government come in. The situation is very fluid. If agreeable to
                            the President, he will send these people. Pres. agreed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we would delay them and not
                            make any final commitment.</p>

                                    <item>—The long-range prospects for Ghana fetching up an

                                        heavily tied to Britain and the West. There is risk; but
                                        less risk over coming years than, say, the risk of Nasser's

                        <p>Mr. Randall, who has agreed to head a small mission to Ghana on the Volta
                            problem, has an appointment to see you at 4:30 on Thursday, October
                            19.</p>
                        <p>I met with Mr. Randall today and discussed the Volta situation with him.
                            He is familiar with the background of the project as a result of his
                            service with the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            Administration. He recognizes that a decision to proceed is not an easy
                            one. On the other hand, he believes that failure to go ahead can be even
                            more detrimental to our own longer run interests. He fully understands
                            why he has been chosen for this task and what is expected of him. He
                            does not blanch at the assignment.</p>
                        <p>He understands that he is to go to Ghana to appraise the situation. At

                            States on this project. He understands that he is to return and report
                            to you early in November, submitting a report which will provide the
                            basis for our proceeding with the project.<note n="1" xml:id="d237fn1">

                                believe that he will retain the support of the army and the police
                                during the period of this estimate. If he should be assassinated, an
                                all-out struggle for power would be almost certain. (Paras.

                            <item>Ghana's economic problems arise principally out of the fall of the

                                anticolonialism. He almost certainly believes that he can use the

                                improve his prospects for aid from both sides. As a consequence of
                                the interplay of these attitudes, we believe that for the immediate

                                If this trend is aggravated by the West's refusal to honor what is

                            by the success of the visit; counting on your approval of proceeding

                            less sharp) to restore his momentum. Jackson also reported that,
                            following an hour-long conversation between the Queen and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>, it had become clear that “if a

                            Volta, the situation here would be most receptive.” He said that if the
                            U.S. wanted to obtain more detailed assurances from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> on the genuineness of Ghana's
                            non-alignment in the months ahead, he was likely to be more receptive
                            and forthcoming in the immediate afterglow of the Queen's visit. Jackson
                            told us following the Queen's departure that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s present mood was to proceed with the Volta dam
                            regardless of the outcome of negotiations with the U.S. and the World
                            Bank, and that he had just authorized an Italian firm to acquire a third
                            dredge. Jackson said the leftist clique had moved in fast following the
                            Queen's departure to bring greater pressures to bear on <persName

                            Minister of Finance and Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, but
                            now <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s leading opponent,
                            has told a U.S. official in London that, despite all the drawbacks, the
                            U.S. must go through with Volta financing; that to withdraw at this time
                            would only play into the hands of <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> and his intimates who would use the incident to
                            go all out for socialism, for withdrawal from the Commonwealth and for
                            closer ties with the Bloc. However, Gbedemah emphatically insisted the
                            U.S. should condition any agreement to proceed on the project upon the
                            understanding that funds only will be made available in proportion to
                            the extent Ghana is able to meet its commitments to the Volta authority.
                            Such a procedure would, he said, place the blame for any financial
                            failure of the Volta project directly on <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>. With regard to the effect of a possible U.S.
                            withdrawal upon other African countries, he only repeated the widely
                            expressed view that “another Aswan would result.”</p>
                        <p>The West Germans have informed us that they will follow through on their
                            plans to finance a road from the port of Tema to Accra (a small project)
                            only on the condition that the U.S. will follow through on the Volta
                            project.</p>

                            the Department stressed that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> is “balancing” between East and West and despite
                            occasional evidence to the contrary they believe Ghana must be placed in
                            a neutral category and will remain there unless pushed in another
                            direction. They felt it would be a mistake to withdraw from the Volta
                            project; that such action would lead to the withdrawal of Ghana from the
                            Commonwealth and heavy damage to the western position not only in Ghana
                            but elsewhere in Africa.</p>

                            for the Volta project. After more than four years of negotiation and
                            several surveys, he firmly believes the U.S. has committed itself to
                            give assistance. Should the U.S. withdraw at this stage, <persName

                            even more to the Bloc. He might take actions against U.S. operations in
                                Ghana—<gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, the Peace Corps, the
                            modest technical assistance program.</p>
                        <p>The Estimate also concludes that even if the U.S. should back the Volta
                            project, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> will not
                            significantly change his present policies. He will continue his attempts
                            to reduce the dominating influence which private western interests have
                            in the Ghanaian economy and will continue to develop close ties with the
                            Bloc.</p>
                        <p>An intelligence memorandum on the “Likely Consequences of various U.S.
                            Courses of Action on the Volta Dam” concludes that most African and
                            Asian leaders believe the U.S. is morally committed to proceed with the
                            Volta project. Recent U.S. uncertainty, together with U.S. displeasure
                            with Afro-Asian neutralism, have made the project seem a test of U.S.
                            willingness to give aid without political strings. African moderates,
                            though they would like to see <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> chastised by not getting the assistance, would
                            be fearful that a negative decision might indicate a reluctance to
                            contribute substantially to African developments.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum examines three contingencies: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>If the U.S. <hi rend="italic">implements</hi> the project, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s political standing would be
                            much enhanced, particularly with the moderate elements. His policies
                            would not change significantly and he would continue to reduce private
                            Western influence and to develop closer Bloc relations. Afro-Asians
                            generally would be pleased at U.S. tolerance of neutralism. Neutrals
                            would still suspect U.S. motives; radicals would conclude that extremist
                            policies do not preclude U.S. aid; and moderates in other African states
                            could be pressured by radical elements to follow <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s example. Leaders who have
                            cooperated with the U.S. would resent aid given to an uncooperative
                            leader.</p>
                        <p>If the U.S. <hi rend="italic">withdraws</hi> from the project, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would denounce the U.S. for its
                            political strings and move even closer to the Bloc. Ghana's current
                            domestic political balance would soon tip in favor of the radicals.
                            Communist influence in all Africa would increase. Although they would
                            exploit U.S. withdrawal as evidence that the U.S. does not intend to
                            help African nations, they would not immediately take over the Volta
                            project <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>but delay until the
                            extent of aid needed to further their aims was determined. Liberia,
                            Nigeria and most of the French-speaking nations would sympathize with
                            U.S. motives but be reluctant to openly support our decision. Most
                            critics would say the U.S. is punishing an African state for not
                            following acceptable policies, remind people of our withdrawal from the
                            Aswan Dam project, and refuse to consider as valid any economic reasons
                            given for the decision.</p>
                        <p>If the U.S. called for a moratorium, reaction would be similar to that of
                            a withdrawal and be expressed more vehemently. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would regard delay as an attempt
                            to blackmail Ghana into complete surrender to American interests, and he
                            would be supported not only by Communists but by many neutrals. The U.S.
                            could not convince <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> or
                            other African leaders of the economics of the problem and our influence
                            would be more disastrously affected by a delay than by a complete
                            withdrawal.</p>

                            DAM</p>
                        <p>The meeting began with a very brief intelligence statement by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>. In view of the
                            President's tight calendar, he was postponing the briefing on
                            Soviet-Finnish relationships. He confined himself to a comment only that
                            a Soviet space activity was to be expected soon. There did indeed follow
                            an unsuccessful space shot on December 11th.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State opened discussion of the Volta project. The
                            Department had reviewed the matter with care, and believed that we
                            should go ahead.<note n="1" xml:id="d240fn1">The Department of State
                                submitted a paper for consideration by the National Security Council
                                recommending this. (Ibid., Countries Series, Ghana, Volta River
                                Project, 1961)</note> We made a commitment in the President's letter

                                    >Document 227</ref>.</note> The Secretary believed that we
                            should enlist Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MHS2"
                                >Macmillan</persName> in attempting to turn <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> on a reasonable course. He also
                            suggested that we should discuss the matter promptly with Congressional
                            leaders. The President believed that we could not get Congressional
                            support and should make our decision without any further consultations
                            with the leadership. It would be better simply to make our decision and
                            then explain it as persuasively as possible.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked how we could justify a decision to help
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> in the light of the
                            leftward and authoritarian course of his domestic politics, and his
                            unhelpful positions on international issues. The essential reply of
                            State Department officers was that we were committed and that a refusal
                            to go forward here would be misunderstood all over Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury took the other view. To him the essential
                            question was whether <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> was a
                            Castro or a Nasser. On the evidence thus far he was inclined to think
                            him a Castro and on this ground he would withhold approval of the Volta
                            project.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of the intelligence estimate of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s character and purpose, and the
                            precise language of the most recent intelligence estimates was examined
                            by the President. Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1"
                                >McCone</persName> interpreted this language as meaning that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> still intended to
                            preserve his independence from Soviet domination, although he certainly
                            expected to seek increasing help from the bloc. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> added that <pb n="370"
                                xml:id="pg_370" facs="0398"/>he had taken soundings of business
                            opinion on the Volta project and had found opinion on the whole not
                            unfavorable.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was in favor
                            of proceeding on the simple ground that we had already committed
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The President then read to the group the entire text of the letter of
                            June 29th, and probably this reading was decisive. The President said
                            dryly that this seemed a fairly warm letter and asked who had drafted
                            it. He was gently reminded by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> that it had been made warmer at the President's own
                            direction. The President remarked that as far as he could tell, the
                            Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General were opposed. The
                            Attorney General had not spoken, the President said, but he could feel
                            the hot breath of his opinion. A little later the Attorney General did
                            speak, arguing that moderate leaders like Houphouet-Boigny would rather
                            that we not go ahead, as he had discovered in his visit to the Ivory
                            Coast. It would be better to take this money and spread it around in all
                            the needy countries of Africa, but if we should go ahead we ought to get
                            something in return.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the meeting, the President directed that there be a careful
                            study of the precise degree of the American financial liability over the
                            early years of the project. Mr. Chayes indicated that this liability
                            would be on the order of $25 million until 1965. The President found
                            these figures comforting and asked that the legal aspects of this
                            involvement be reviewed by both the State Department and the Department
                            of Justice. This review was subsequently conducted and the President's
                            final approval of the Volta project was given on December 12th.</p>

                                >Russell</persName>, to deliver this letter to you informing you of

                        <p>When Mr. Randall returned to Washington from his previous trip to Accra,
                            he told me of your cordiality and hospitality and of his frank
                            conversations with you on my behalf. In the same spirit of candor which
                            characterized our talks in March and which has continued in our
                            subsequent communications, I asked Mr. Randall to explain to you the

                        <p>In all frankness I must say that these concerns still exist. Nevertheless

                        <p>The Volta project is an investment in the future generations of the

                            large dividends, for I am hopeful that these generations will live in a
                            world of increasing freedom in which they will work out a pattern of
                            life to meet their own needs and desires.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government looks forward to a continued close

                        <p>In coming to a decision on United States participation in the Volta River
                            Project in Ghana, the President was concerned over the possibility that
                            Ghana would nationalize the project after it was completed. One opinion
                            held that the approval of the Volta River Project would encourage Ghana
                            to permit the establishment of private industry with foreign investment
                            playing a major role in Ghana's industrialization.</p>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>Ghana's Cabinet has just made a decision to acquire 100% of foreign
                            investment in certain enterprises. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> has clearly expressed his preference for
                            government establishment of industry and his view that private
                            investment will not play a major role in Ghana's industrialization.</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy continues to be the encouragement of private investment and
                            technical assistance in Ghana for its further development and to counter
                            Soviet activities in industry and in the country as a whole. However,
                            the Cabinet's decision at this time, following so soon after approval of
                            the Volta River Project, is a clear indication of Ghana's intentions and
                            perhaps unwillingness to follow Western philosophy and leadership.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s overpowering desire to
                            export his brand of nationalism has unquestionably made Ghana one of the
                            foremost practitioners of subversion in Africa. Ghana's influence, or
                            interference, is felt in all sections of the continent. Concentrating at
                            first on the dependent areas, of <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0402"

                            African states, particularly Togo and the Congo.</p>
                        <p>There is some indication of a slow-down in activity in recent months,
                            undoubtedly due in part to the domestic political problems which have
                            beset <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> since he returned
                            from his extended visit to the Bloc last summer, as well as <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s desire that nothing go wrong
                            with the final Volta negotiations. A possible additional influencing
                            factor could be a growing realization that the policies he has pursued
                            with his neighbors have so far caused more harm than good to Ghana.
                            Finally, the deteriorating financial situation in Ghana, and resultant
                            drain on its reserves, could serve as a deterrent to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s more ambitious schemes. There
                            remains the possibility, however, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> will be receptive to furnishing supplemental funds for
                            subversive purposes.</p>
                        <p>When Clarence Randall met with <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> last December to inform him of the United States
                            decision on the Volta, he candidly told <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> that the American Government and people were
                            most concerned by the reports of interference by Ghana in the internal
                            affairs of other free and independent African nations. He added that it
                            would be of obvious assistance to the United States in justifying this
                            major contribution if the Government of Ghana could make a statement
                            that it would not engage in such activities. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> touched upon the subject of
                            subversion in his subsequent radio address to the nation on the Volta
                            project, his remarks were hardly an assurance that Ghana would refrain
                            from such activities in the future. Nevertheless Mr. Randall's frank
                            confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> on this
                            subject, and the knowledge that Mr. Randall was speaking as President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s personal
                            representative, might have some salutary effect on the Ghanaian
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Also, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> met secretly with
                            President Maga of Dahomey about three weeks ago at Pusiga in northern
                            Dahomey for the purpose of discussing the deteriorating relations
                            between <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and President
                            Olympio of Togo. Maga reported to his fellow chiefs of state at the

                        <p>Our relations with Ghana have considerably improved since the fall of
                            1961. At that time Ghana appeared to be moving swiftly toward an
                            accommodation with the Bloc. Anti-Western feelings were especially
                            evident in statements by Ghanaian leaders and vitriolic press attacks.
                            Ghana voted with the Bloc on Berlin, disarmament and other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issues; <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> sent military cadets to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; received and stock-piled Bloc arms
                            in Ghana. He dismissed pro-Western ministers, the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> military chief of staff, and down-graded generally the
                            British military posture in Ghana. Following a trip through the Bloc,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> accelerated the
                            socialization of Ghana.</p>
                        <p>Especially in the Congo, U.S.-Ghanaian policies clashed head on.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> had hoped to dominate
                            the Congo as a first step toward achieving his Pan-African goals.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LP3">Lumumba</persName> had assured him that
                            the Congo would join the Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union. This hope was dashed
                            by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, supported by the U.S.; as a
                            result, he moved closer and closer to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Internal tensions also were heightened during this period by mounting
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> over his
                            economic and political policies. <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> turned against the British, blaming them for
                            creating unrest, and became increasingly suspicious of his more
                            conservative ministers who he thought might attempt to replace him.</p>
                        <p>Unquestionably our decision to give assistance on the Volta project
                            changed the atmosphere from one of acrimony into one of guarded
                            cordiality. However, this did not bring about any fundamental change in
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s foreign or domestic
                            policies. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> has
                            continued over the past 9 months to concentrate increasing authority in
                            his own hands. This has been accompanied by the ousting of Ministers
                            Gbedemah and Botsio, and a long time political associate, Krobo
                            Edusel.</p>
                        <p>As the situation stands today, there are some hopeful developments in
                            Ghana—stemming in part from the Volta decision—which we should watch
                            with care and encourage when possible: <list>

                        <p>There are both promising and unpromising aspects in the military
                            situation in Ghana. On the good side, Ghana on May 1 signed a military
                            agreement with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> under which the
                            British will train Ghanaian armed forces. Canada and Pakistan also will
                            participate, and <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is
                            sending a small number of junior officers to U.S. Service Schools.
                            However, serious problems could arise in connection with the proposed
                            African High Command, which will be the military arm of the Casablanca
                            Powers, with headquarters in Accra. This may well start an all-out arms
                            race and provide an opportunity for increased Soviet influence through
                            materiel, technicians, etc. The Command might decide to intervene
                            militarily in territories still under Portuguese and Spanish rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> also is supporting two
                            international meetings, either being held or scheduled to be held, in
                            Accra. One is the “Freedom Fighters Congress"—strictly
                            anti-colonial—which includes nationalists from all the dependent areas
                            in Africa. The other is the Government-sponsored “Ban the Bomb”
                            Conference which probably will support a position more in accord with
                            that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than with the U.S. (In
                            1961 <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> was awarded the Lenin
                            Peace Prize.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> recently decided to assign
                            the Ghana Trade Unions Congress a more active role in Africa to promote
                            his brand of Pan-Africanism through the labor medium. Its leftist
                            Secretary-General, John K. Tettegah, has been put in charge of the
                            offensive. A major objective will be to drive the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICFTU1">ICFTU</gloss> out of Africa; another the
                            ascendency of Ghanaian influence in the radically-oriented All-African
                            Trade Unions Federation. If launched in earnest, the project could have
                            important implications for Africa, the <gloss target="#t_ICFTU1"
                                >ICFTU</gloss>, and the U.S.</p>
                        <p>In the economic sphere, although Ghana had acquired a considerable
                            sterling balance at independence, the economy has suffered both from
                            imprudent development spending and depressed cocoa prices. Ghana's gold
                            and foreign exchange reserves, which totalled $532 million at the end of
                            1955 and $382 million at the end of 1960, fell to an estimated <pb
                                n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0405"/>$200 million in March 1962.
                            Moreover, most of these reserves already are committed for currency
                            backing and development projects.</p>
                        <p>In July 1961 the Ghanaian Government instituted fiscal measures which may
                            prove helpful, but preliminary information indicates that revenues were
                            below and expenditures above budget estimates during the first half of
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. Thus the budget deficit may
                            be even larger than anticipated.</p>
                        <p>Concurrently there has developed a discouraging climate for private
                            foreign investment in Ghana, primarily because of a growing uncertainty
                            resulting from contradictions in the Government's attitude—the
                            Government insists that there is a place for foreign investment, but
                            actions and official statements have discouraged it. For example, Ghana
                            violated the contract it had made with Pillsbury early this year and
                            announced the establishment of a state trading company which would
                            compete against private commercial firms. Pillsbury cancelled its
                            contract forthwith.</p>
                        <p>Most of the $196 million of Soviet credits (Tab C)<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d245fn1">Not attached to the source text.</note> has not
                            been utilized. Ghana is expected to draw more heavily on these credits
                            in the future and unquestionably the Soviet presence in Ghana will
                            concurrently be strengthened. On June 1, Ghana signed a 3-year technical
                            agreement with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under which
                            Soviet credits will be used to establish state farms; the remaining
                            credits probably will be used for similar state-owned enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Accra has succeeded in maintaining very helpful contacts
                            with various groups in Ghana—especially the more moderate pro-Western
                            ones—which include civil servants, cocoa farmers, small entrepreneurs
                            (including the “mammy” traders), and the university students.</p>
                        <p>Our relations with some other groups, however, are less rewarding. These
                            include the Convention People's Party, the Ghana Trade Unions Congress,
                            the Youth Pioneers and the cooperatives.</p>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is in trouble at
                                home. In the course of establishing himself as messianic leader of
                                an authoritarian state, he has broken or antagonized internal
                                competitors and alienated many moderates. During the past year
                                persons with marked Communist sympathies came to the fore in the
                                regime, but in recent weeks some persons of moderate tendency have
                                become of increased importance. He has deprived dissenters of all
                                effective means of expression except violence. At the same time he
                                is experiencing doubts as to the reliability of some of the forces
                                upon which he has depended. The recent nearly successful attempt on
                                his life and subsequent terror bombings have dramatized to <persName

                                permitted widespread accusations of blame, including the US and
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. This charge is probably for
                                internal consumption and uses the ever-popular theme of
                                anticolonialism. He arrested members of his government whom he
                                probably suspected of personal ambitions and probably suspects
                                tribal elements, labor leaders, military officers and particularly
                                the exiled oppositionists whom he may believe to be supported by the

                                firm and his popularity still widespread. However, pressures against
                                him will increase, particularly if the tight economic situation does
                                not improve or if taxes and forced savings arouse widespread
                                dissatisfaction. We do not believe he will attempt to attract the
                                support of political moderates by altering his policies, domestic or
                                foreign, though in an effort to forestall a financial crisis the
                                government may attempt to improve the climate for private foreign
                                investment. (Paras. 11-13)</item>

                            <item>If <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> were assassinated
                                the security forces would probably take steps to maintain order. The
                                Cabinet would try to follow the constitutional procedures of
                                appointing a commission, probably of old-guard Convention Peoples'
                                Party (<gloss target="#t_CPP1">CPP</gloss>) leaders, to rule until a
                                new President was chosen. If they were able to move surely and
                                promptly, the security forces would probably support them. We
                                believe that it is by such means that a successor government would
                                establish itself. In the event the party cannot agree on a
                                commission or successor government, disorders would be likely to
                                result, in which case the intervention of the security forces would
                                give the moderates, both domestic and in exile, a better chance of
                                establishing the successor regime. Whatever group comes to power is
                                likely to follow many of the radical policies espoused by <persName

                            <item>The most obvious way we could deal more harshly with Ghana is to
                                cut down our aid program. The details of our current aid program are
                                shown in the table at Tab 6. In summary, they are as follows. We
                                obligated nearly $2 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                1962 in development grants for a variety of educational and
                                technical assistance projects. The big item was the Volta Project.
                                In connection with that, we obligated $117 million last year, of
                                which $7 million was charged against development loan funds
                                directly; $55 million were Ex-Im Bank funds transferred to the
                                    <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> account and obligated
                                through <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>; and $55 million was
                                committed by Ex-Im directly. Next year we propose a somewhat reduced
                                program of development grants totaling $1.4 million. This represents
                                a continuation of the on-going programs with lower levels for some,
                                and slightly increased levels for others. In addition, we propose
                                once again to commit $7 million in development loans; $4.5 million
                                for the construction of the basic science building and hospital for
                                a medical school, and $2.5 million as capital for an investment
                                bank. The medical school is a project close to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s heart. Planning on this is
                                complete, and the project is ready to go as soon as a decision is
                                made. The investment bank is not yet in the same state; so far the
                                report of the survey team on the bank has not been received. <gloss

                                another $8-9 hundred thousand in development grants on more activity
                                of the present kind, but does not now have the money to do
                                so.</item>

                                    enterprise. As originally conceived, the institution would have
                                    the purpose of financing State-owned enterprises. Two banking
                                    experts from Czechoslovakia were brought in to advise in setting
                                    it up. More recently, Ghana has changed the concept of the bank
                                    to emphasize the financing of private business, has asked for
                                    American advisers, and has let the Czechs go home. The details
                                    are given in the attached memorandum from <gloss
                                        target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. (Tab 7)</p>
                                <p>There are still other encouraging signs. A general law regulating
                                    foreign capital investment is now being considered by the
                                    administration. The latest draft has removed two features which
                                    we thought undesirable: (1) 60% of the earnings of any foreign
                                    enterprise be reinvested in Ghana; and (2) a long list of
                                    industries was reserved for State enterprise. The law is still
                                    in its draft stage. It has many technical weaknesses, and we are
                                    not yet sure what in fact will come out. The Sunkist Tuna Fish
                                    enterprise, which involved a proposal for operating a fishing
                                    fleet and a cannery was scared away from Ghana last Spring by
                                    the conditions then proposed. They now feel that the situation
                                    has changed sufficiently to make it desirable to look again.</p>
                                <p>Another sign of a turn away from emphasis on exclusively State
                                    control of industry are the appointments of W. Halm, former
                                    Ambassador to the U.S. as Governor of the Bank of Ghana, and
                                    Adomakah, as first head to the proposed investment bank. They
                                    are both pro-Western, moderate and technically competent. Still
                                    another is the stoppage of work on the Bui Dam project by the
                                    Soviets.</p>

                                    with <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> without in
                                    any way being inhibited from speaking plainly to him. He shares
                                    the view that the outlook in Ghana is favorable to the West in
                                    general and to the U.S. in particular. I spoke to him at some

                                take a major step beyond this to a harder policy by cutting down on
                                aid to Ghana.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>There are two arguments that can be made for a harder policy toward Ghana
                            at this moment. First, it would be useful to make an example of one of
                            the left-leaning neutralists, especially in the light of the present
                            situation. Ghana is a country which lends itself well to such treatment
                            from our point of view. <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            has been extreme in his statements. Ghana is not of strategic importance
                            to us in Africa in any direct way. Further, <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s actions and words have alienated many of his
                            fellow African leaders, especially his neighbors. Accordingly, a strong
                            line by the U.S. might be welcomed by other African countries.</p>
                        <p>The considerations on the other side, however, appear to me much
                            weightier. We have a substantial U.S. economic interest in Ghana in the
                            shape of Valco. The present outlook for the success of that enterprise
                            is favorable, and those in charge of its operations are optimistic. A
                            hardening in our policy toward Ghana, whether by reduction of aid more
                            than is inevitably required by the aid cuts of the Congress, or by other
                            means, may endanger Valco's prospects.</p>
                        <p>This alone would not be persuasive if there were strong political reasons
                            for a harsher policy. However, the political reasons appear to me to go
                            in the other direction. There are signs that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> is turning away from the Bloc and that his
                            neutralism is moving from neutralism against us to neutralism for us.
                            Just because has has been vociferous and virulent in his previous stand,
                            the gains to us of a permanent change in his attitude will be large. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> joins Toure among
                            those who are visibly and publicly disillusioned with the results of
                            close political alignment with, and heavy economic dependence on, the
                            Bloc, this will be a significant <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"
                            />gain for the U.S., not only in Africa, but more broadly. At this
                            moment, when <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is making at
                            least some moves in directions favorable to us, his political situation
                            is fluid, and when the ultimate results are in doubt, it would be unwise
                            to apply pressures on him that might well cause him to return to his
                            previous pro-Soviet orientation. Finally, at a moment when we have won a
                            significant victory in the world political struggle we should show a
                            position of generosity in relation to small neutrals, even those who
                            have been more neutral with respect to the Soviet Union than they have
                            with respect to us.</p>

                        <p>The President met with Mr. Edgar Kaiser, Chad Calhoun and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC2">Carl Kaysen</persName> on January 23, at 6:30 p.m.,
                            to hear a report by Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_KPM2"
                                >Kaiser</persName> and Calhoun on their visit to Ghana. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> observed the President
                            had read <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1">Mahoney</persName>'s reporting
                            telegrams and had a fair picture of the substance of his conversations.
                            As a conclusion he offered the proposition that we ought to have a three
                            to six months' period in which we try to make <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> deliver on specific political goals in terms as
                            definite as Valco had got him to deliver on economic goals. The
                            President asked <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> to explain
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s behavior. He could
                            understand his trying to <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0413"/>deal
                            with both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but he could not understand the
                            lack of subtlety and balance. Why did <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> lean so hard against us if he thought continuing
                            relations was not of any use to him. <persName corresp="#p_KPM2"
                                >Kaiser</persName> responded in terms of two factors. The influence
                            of Bing and others in <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s
                            immediate entourage and the desire of <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> to respond favorably to everybody who saw him
                            frequently. <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> raised two
                            specific questions. Whether Calhoun should return to Ghana as <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> had requested to work on the
                            investment bill and whether <persName corresp="#p_KPM2"
                                >Kaiser</persName> should persist in his attempt to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> to make a trip to the U.S.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> explained the
                            significance of the investment bill both to Valco and to the country in
                            general. The President agreed that we should make an effort along the
                            lines <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> suggested.
                            Essentially, however, he thought that the Nydell case was an immediate
                            test and if there was not a satisfactory resolution of the Nydell case
                            in the sense of a complete back-down by the Ghana Government, he did not
                            see how we could expect anything in other areas.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d249fn1">On January 11, the Ghanaian Ministry of Foreign
                                Affairs delivered a note to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1"
                                    >Mahoney</persName> requesting the unofficial recall of two
                                members of the U.S. Embassy staff in Accra, Dr. Carl C. Nydell,
                                Regional Medical Officer, and William B. Davis, Cultural Affairs

                                been instructed not to give any reason for the request. On January
                                15, <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1">Mahoney</persName> met with
                                President <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and told him
                                that such a recall was unjustified since neither man had done
                                anything improper, and stated that the United States did not intend
                                to recall either officer unless the Government of Ghana officially
                                declared him persona non grata. (Memorandum from <persName

                            resolution of the Nydell case, he agreed that Calhoun should return and
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> should present his
                            invitation to <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>. In
                            addition, the President suggested that we draw up a list of definite
                            results we could expect in the near future in the political sphere,
                            especially in response to the Ghanaian President, as an indicator of our
                            ability to exercise a minimal degree of influence necessary on <persName

                        <p>Edgar Kaiser suggested the President write a letter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> in response to his own letter in

                            views on U.S.-Ghanaian relations, make some mention of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName>'s invitation to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> to take a trip to the U.S., and
                            express his regard for and confidence in the Ambassador. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> also raised the question of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1">Mahoney</persName>'s present
                            instructions and whether it would not be wise to encourage <persName

                            with <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>. The President said
                            he would consider the letter and <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1"

                        <p>Thank you for your letters of January 21 and 31. As I have said to you

                            can be helpful in improving our understanding of each other's viewpoint,
                            and thus contribute to the improvement of relations between Ghana and
                            the United States. I wish, also, to thank you for your kindness <pb

                            listening both to their views, and to the points I raised with them as
                            giving me concern in our relations with Ghana.</p>
                        <p>In your letter you discuss the Nydell case. I think Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWPJ1">Mahoney</persName> has already told you our views
                            on this matter, and I wish to add only one point. We have seen no
                            evidence of improper behavior on Dr. Nydell's part, and I have been
                            informed by my officials, who have made a close review of his actions,
                            that there is no basis, other than coincidence, for the belief that he
                            is in any way involved in improper activities in Ghana.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate the points you make about the economic problems of Ghana and
                            of other African countries. We are aware of these problems and most
                            sympathetic to the efforts that you are making to deal with them. Our
                            understanding and sympathy lie behind our efforts through aid and other
                            programs to assist in economic and social development in Ghana and other
                            African countries. The question of what particular economic and social
                            arrangements are best suited to development is one on which different
                            governments have differed and will undoubtedly continue to differ. Each
                            country is the best judge of its own institutions. We, for our part,
                            have no desire to impose our own views on these matters on any other
                            government, nor do we believe that what works well in the United States
                            always works equally well elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>However, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KPM2">Kaiser</persName> pointed out
                            to you, continued fruitful economic relations between our two countries
                            must rest on a broader degree of sympathy and understanding. For
                            whatever reason, our general relations have been difficult recently, and
                            I certainly would welcome whatever can be done on both sides to improve
                            them.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I think it would be helpful to me, and you might find
                            it helpful to you, if you were to continue the full and frank exchanges
                            you have recently had with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MWPJ1"
                                >Mahoney</persName>. He has my trust and confidence, and continued
                            discussion with him can do much to improve that sense of mutual
                            understanding and mutual forbearance which is necessary for the improved
                            relations between our two countries which we both desire.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely, John F. Kennedy</p>

                        <p>Ghanaian Ambassador Ribeiro presented his credentials to the President
                            April 25 after which a frank and pleasant conversation took place in a
                            cordial atmosphere. The Amb conveyed the greetings of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> and expressed
                            appreciation for assistance which US is providing to Ghana. The
                            President reciprocated greetings and noted that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> was one of the first visitors to
                            White House under his administration.</p>
                        <p>The President told the Ambassador that, although some difficulties had
                            existed in the bilateral relations between our countries, he believed
                            that the situation had improved in recent months. He continued that,
                            nevertheless, the articles that appeared in the Ghanaian press were not
                            helpful. He said that he personally and his Administration were subject
                            to attack in the American press but it was well known that the
                            government did not control the American press. However, when the
                            Ghanaian press attacked the United States he was led to wonder whether
                            this was not in fact a reflection of the policy of the Government of
                            Ghana.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that such was certainly not the case and that,
                            although the Government of Ghana supported the press financially, it did
                            not control its output and frequently found itself embarrassed by what
                            had been written and had to straighten things out. The Ambassador said
                            that the Ghana press was a matter to which he would give high
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador gave an account of current progress on the Volta Dam. He
                            noted that it should be finished in 1965 and expressed the hope that the
                            President would be present in Ghana at the dedication. The President
                            reminded the Ambassador that he had taken the decision to go ahead with
                            the Volta River Project in face of considerable opposition in the Senate
                            and elsewhere, that it was a large commitment, and that he followed
                            personally and closely developments within Ghana. The President said
                            that it was obvious that our two countries would not agree on all
                            matters but remarked that these disagreements should not be allowed to
                            reach point of interfering with cordial bilateral relations. President
                                <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"/>stated that critics of US
                            decision to undertake heavy commitments in Ghana must be proven
                            wrong.</p>

                            issues that is usually on the other side from ours (e.g. the Ghanaian

                            South Africa). On balance, however, there has been no serious
                            deterioration, and the Volta-Valco project is serving well its political
                            purpose—to retain a significant Western role and influence in Ghana.</p>

                        <p>I called on President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> this
                            morning to report on the situation in Ghana and answer questions he
                            might have. I first gave him a brief appraisal. I mentioned that we have
                            had a period of comparative calm in Ghana during the past four months,
                            chiefly because of moderation in the press, but that no fundamental
                            changes had occurred in <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s
                            attitude, and we should be ready for further outbreaks, especially as
                            African issues sharpen. I told him that <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> had good control but that Ghana is probably
                            moving into an era of political unrest as a result of <pb n="391"
                                xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"/>economic pressures from diminishing
                            reserves, continued heavy spending and a rather severe tax program. I
                            told him I thought <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> would
                            survive this difficulty because of his pragmatic approach to domestic
                            politics. I said that although we could expect further trouble and
                            perhaps increased Bloc penetration, Ghana was a good bet in the long
                            haul because of its many Western institutions and traditions.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me what I thought of <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName>'s ideas, specifically whether he is a Marxist. I
                            replied that <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName> is a badly
                            confused and immature person who is not quite sure of what he wants
                            except that he wants to lead all of Africa. I said he has much Marxism
                            in his makeup but that his performance, as in the development of Ghana's
                            domestic economy, was mixed and that internally there was promise of
                            Ghana's being at least partially Western. I said that in the field of
                            foreign relations <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>
                            frequently serves the purposes of Mao and <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> but that he was too much of an egotist ever
                            willingly to be their pawn. In short, I said, his Marxist bark was worse
                            than his bite and that I felt we must learn to live with him.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how the Volta Project was going, mentioning that we
                            were now at a point where heavy financial outlays are to be made under
                            the loan program. I replied the project was on schedule and going well.
                            I mentioned that I realized his decision to go ahead with this project
                            was a difficult one. I added that in my opinion he would not regret it
                            and that the Volta Project will prove a lasting boon to Ghana, with or
                            without <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>. I also said that
                            it would be very hazardous to withdraw now and that if we did, the
                            Russians would probably pick up the chips, or at least give the
                            impression of doing so.</p>
                        <p>The President also inquired about the leftist press. I said it was still
                            a sore point on which we have been able to obtain only temporary relief.
                            I then mentioned <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Nkrumah</persName>'s recent
                            speech to the Pan-African journalists in which he characterized the U.S.
                            as a neo-colonialist power and alleged our press was the tool of the big
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>The President was very warm in his praise of our Mission's efforts. We
                            were together about fifteen minutes.</p>

                            can discuss the matter with him then.</p>
                        <p>To facilitate the financing of portions of the program, we will urge a

                        <p>(If mention is made of the big Konkoure Dam and/or smelter)</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is primarily interested in
                            creating the conditions for sound economic development aimed at raising
                            living standards. We feel that the program we propose is better designed
                            to meet Guinea's immediate problems—such as employment, production and
                            education.</p>
                        <p>The big dam and smelter are essentially designed to support and expand
                            the existing bauxite industry and will not show results for several
                            years. We doubt if the American people will set aside this much money at
                            this time for an African project that will not directly or promptly
                            benefit people.</p>
                        <p>Our proposed program does not rule out the eventual construction of a big
                            dam and smelter. Much depends on the trend of the world aluminum market.
                            The private companies involved in the Fria and Boke might well be more
                            disposed to reconsider the financing of this project in the future.</p>

                            our proposal. The problem is not that we object to his accepting Russian
                            aid. The problem is that Russian preemption of Konkoure <pb n="394"

                            guided by three basic considerations: First, we wish use current
                            favorable climate Guinea-US relations to move into a position in which
                            US has increased role and influence in Guinea. Second, we wish alter
                            previous drift Guinea into Soviet camp and move Guinea to neutral
                            position at this stage and re-integration into African
                            political-economic scene. Third, we wish to provide basis for continued
                            US and other Free World access to Guinea's bauxite reserves. Key element
                            in achieving these objectives is pre-emption by West of Konkoure dam
                            site. Convinced here Russians will, if possible, undertake construct
                            large dam and related smelter. If Soviets succeed takeover Konkoure in
                            addition to present magnitude their role Guinea, overwhelming Soviet
                            presence will make achievement general US objectives more remote if not
                            impossible.</p>

                            conclusions confirm our own conviction that now is the time for us to
                            make a really serious endeavor to help <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> and his Government in order to reduce Guinea's
                            dependence on the Soviet Bloc and bring that country back somewhere near
                            a line of true neutralism. The submission of Mr. Shriver's memorandum
                            takes place at a propitious moment, for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> has now received a formal
                            response to his presentation to <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> of our aid package, about which you were informed
                            by the Ambassador during his recent consultation here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>From the paper Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName>
                            showed you at the White House you will recall the essentials of our aid
                            package to Guinea,<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2"><ref target="#d255"
                                    >Document 255</ref>.</note> so I will not go into detail in
                            enumerating its component parts. Let me simply say that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> has made his
                            presentation to President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>,
                            and the latter's reaction was favorable. Now we have received Guinea's
                            specific counter proposals, which, while not entirely to our liking, are
                            nonetheless not discouraging and are of a nature to encourage our going
                            back to <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> with further
                            details and reemphasis on the most important parts of our original
                            package.</p>
                        <p>The principal element in the Guinea Government's counter proposal is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> apparently wants to
                            keep the Souapiti site on the Konkoure River available for the original
                            large Konkoure project involving an aluminum smelter plant and a dam,
                            hoping that an offer will still be forthcoming (from us or the Russians)
                            to carry out this major undertaking “from any source at some future
                            date.” Instead of accepting our proposal for going to work right away to
                            build a modest dam and power installation at Souapiti (which could later
                            on be expanded to meet Guinea's original desires for a major smelter-dam
                            operation), Guinea suggests that we construct a hydro-electric project
                            (40,000 kw) at Kinkon, <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>located
                            on one of the tributaries of the Konkoure, farther up north in the Fouta
                            Djallon. <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName>'s half
                            brother, Ismael Toure, who is Minister of Public Works, informed
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> that the
                            Kinkon project is desired because it would permit the development of
                            industry and the expansion of agriculture in the Labe region, and
                            because it would also serve as a potential source of power for eventual
                            exploitation of the bauxite deposits in Northern Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Reactions in the Department to undertaking the Kinkon project have been
                            unenthusiastic, first because we have no information whatsoever
                            regarding this proposal (and it would take some time before an adequate
                            study of its merits could be undertaken), but primarily because this
                            would leave the Konkoure open for Soviet pre-emption. On the other hand,
                            we have sufficient information on the Konkoure, since surveys of it were
                            begun by the French almost a decade ago.</p>
                        <p>The Guinea Government also suggested other counter proposals, including
                            the substitution of a school for engineers, technicians, and electronic
                            technicians for our own proposed school for administration. The
                            Government also iterated some of the reservations it has had on joining
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                >IBRD</gloss>, although they indicated they would be willing to
                            discuss the possibility of membership with the officials of the Bank,
                            and, we hope, of the Fund. We cannot accept the counter-proposal
                            regarding the use of the Peace Corps for roadbuilding instead of
                            education and health because it implies the furnishing of equipment and
                            materials on a scale too costly to fit into the aid package.</p>
                        <p>We have now considered Guinea's counter-proposals in detail and have just
                            sent Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> a
                                telegram,<note n="3" xml:id="d257fn3"><ref target="#d256">Document
                                    256</ref>.</note> a copy of which is enclosed, instructing him
                            to stress to President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> that
                            it would be to Guinea's advantage to have another long and serious look
                            at our original proposal for a modest dam and power installation at
                            Souapiti. We hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2"
                                >Attwood</persName> will manage to see President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> alone when he makes this second
                            approach. If President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>
                            stands firm on the request that we build a dam at Kinkon we may have to
                            agree to examine this new project, but in such case we would make it
                            clear that we would still be going ahead with our Souapiti proposal.
                            For, as pointed out in enclosed telegram, unless we thus preclude a
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> takeover of the Konkoure,
                            Soviet presence and influence in Guinea could reach a point where our
                            own objectives become remote and perhaps even unattainable.</p>

                        <p>In your memorandum of July 5,<note n="1" xml:id="d259fn1"><ref
                                    target="#d258">Document 258</ref>.</note> you asked whether we
                            could finance the big dam in Guinea if we omitted all other elements of
                            our aid program for that country and what it would cost in dollars to do
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The big Konkoure hydro-electric project would cost about $180-200
                            million, but it would serve no purpose unless it were associated with an
                            aluminum smelter to use most of the power generated. Depending upon the
                            size of the installation, a smelter would cost anywhere from $115
                            million to $160 million. The entire project would, therefore, cost from
                            a minimum of about $295 million to a maximum of about $360 million and
                            would take about five to six years to complete.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"/>
                        <p>The projects in the aid program which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> proposed to the Guinea
                            Government involve a total cost of about $45-50 million over a period of
                            two to three years. This program is composed of $34-40 million for a
                            small version of the Konkoure Dam plus about $10 million for other
                            projects such as industrial development, a school for public
                            administration, and English language training.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, if the United States were to undertake only the dam and
                            related smelter the total cost would be $250-310 million more than we
                            presently contemplate undertaking, assuming <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Sekou Toure</persName> accepts our package program.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the preceding, however, we are also considering financial
                            assistance for the development of the Boke bauxite resources by a
                            private Western consortium. Here the amount of the United States
                            commitment could be as much as $130 million in loans plus a guaranty of
                            equity investment for which we would have to reserve as much as $15
                            million, or a total of $145 million. The entire complex—Konkoure,
                            smelter, and Boke—could cost us anywhere from about $440 to about $500
                            million.</p>
                        <p>If we were to undertake the big Konkoure project, we would, of course,
                            seek participation by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and
                            third countries. We have as yet no assurances that Guinea would join the
                            Fund and Bank, and the chances are that other non-US Government
                            participation will be limited. If the US were to undertake financing
                            this complex (or even the small dam), we would be obligated to provide
                            the entire sum, reduced only to the extent we could get participation by
                            others.</p>
                        <p>The sums involved would appear to require a disproportionately large
                            amount of US aid to Guinea relative to other demands on our limited aid
                            resources. More friendly African states would react adversely if the US
                            were heavily involved in the financing of a large dam and other
                            extensive facilities in Guinea especially following announcement of our
                            support of the large Volta project in Ghana. Several of these nations
                            have also requested or indicated they will be seeking US assistance to
                            construct large dams, (i.e., Kouilou, Sotuba, Inga and Niger dams). We
                            have, therefore, concluded that we should not make any offer on the big
                            Konkoure project at this time, but should permit Ambassador <persName

                        <p>Mr. Diakite stated that the Guinean Delegation was most pleased with the
                            results of their visit to the U.S., adding that the Delegation was
                            grateful for this generous assistance that the President, through
                            A.I.D., was making available to Guinea. The Minister reviewed Guinea's
                            past relations with the U.S., expressing gratitude for the timely U.S.
                            assistance given at the outset of Guinea's difficult access to
                            independence. He went on to describe Guinea's current economic
                            difficulties, mentioning the failure of certain countries to live up to
                            their promises, and specifically Guinea's balance of payment
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to whether the Delegation had discussed this
                            situation with Mr. Per Jacobssen of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite replied that discussions with the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> were still under way and requested that the President
                            support Guinea's request for membership in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he would speak to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> regarding the best course of
                            action to take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite stated that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> was
                            attempting to put Guinea in the same class as Togo; i.e., a small small
                            country, eligible for an $11 million quota, whereas the Guineans felt
                            that based on comparisons of exports and imports Guinea should be more
                            appropriately considered a big small country like Senegal, which had a
                            $25 million quota.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired as to the amount of aid, budgetary or
                            otherwise, that Guinea was receiving from the French.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite replied that Guinea was receiving no assistance whatsoever
                            from the French. In fact, he went on to state, the French owed Guinea a
                            considerable amount of money. He described this debt as taking the form
                            of pensions owed by the French Government to veterans of French Military
                            service which Guinea had been paying since independ-ence at the rate of
                            some $8 million per year, now totaling approximately $30 million.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired as to whether the Guineans had attempted to
                            resolve their differences with the French with a view to re-establishing
                            normal relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite replied that President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName> had written to President <persName>De
                                Gaulle</persName> upon the signature of the Evian agreements, but
                            that this gesture had had no echo.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that he was seeing French Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> the next day and would inform
                            him of the visit of the Guinean delegation. He went on to say that he
                            did not want to see most African countries having access to the Common
                            Market with Guinea left out. The President then inquired as to Guinea's
                            reserves in gold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite replied that Guinea had no gold reserves, but that her
                            foreign exchange reserves consisted of approximately $30 million. He
                            went on to describe in general terms Guinea's balance of payments
                            difficulties. He described how certain foreign enterprises had made
                            commitments to their foreign lenders and how Guinea respected these
                            commitments. He stated that Guinea's imports matched approximately her
                            exports but that the capital repayment requirements of these foreign
                            enterprises resulted in a deficit of approximately $30 million per year.
                            He went on to state that Guinea wished to settle its accounts with
                            France, but that raising of the question of Guinea's participation in
                            the Common Market prior to normalization of relations on an overall
                            basis would be premature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Diakite reiterated the gratitude of his Government for the generous
                            assistance provided by the U.S. He specifically mentioned the Investment
                            Guaranty Agreement which had been signed the day before, as well as the
                            commodity import assistance to which the U.S. had committed itself. He
                            stated parenthetically that Guinea should be considered apart from other
                            African countries because it had no metropole to support its currency
                            system. He suggested that a possible solution to this <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>problem might lie in permitting Guinea
                            to utilize local currencies generated by U.S. import programs for the
                            purchase of U.S. material.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that local currencies generated by P.L. 480 or
                            other import programs could not be converted to dollars. He again
                            expressed his surprise that no French assistance was being made
                            available to Guinea. The President then pointed out that the U.S. also
                            had its balance of payment problems. He cited the $100 billion that the
                            U.S. had made available to other countries for aid. He pointed to the
                            loss of $11 billion in gold from U.S. reserves, pointing out that if the
                            U.S. ceased its aid operations it would have no balance of payments
                            problem. He explained that in the U.S., a free country, he had requested
                            the Congress for $4.75 billion in foreign aid funds but that he had no
                            assurance that these funds would be forthcoming, pointing to last year's
                            cut of $1 billion in the foreign aid program. He described how, whenever
                            a dam was proposed for a foreign country, certain congressmen said they
                            needed dams in their districts.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that he did not wish the Delegation to leave
                            thinking that the U.S. was not concerned with the problems of Guinea. He
                            stated that on the contrary he had been impressed by the cordial and
                            sincere welcome given to the various American representatives who had
                            gone to Guinea, mentioning specifically the hearty welcome given to his
                            brother-in-law, Mr. Shriver. The President went on to state that the
                            U.S. desired a truly independent Guinea, free from the East-West
                            struggle. He understood Guinea's position, citing the neutral policy
                            that the U.S. had maintained for 100 years. The President concluded by
                            expressing the hope that the Guinean Delegation would understand why the
                            U.S. could not do all that it wished.</p>
                        <p>The President, in an aside to Messrs. Hutchinson and Abrams, stated that
                            efforts should be made to make full use of the P.L. 480 program in
                            assisting Guinea in its balance of payments problems.</p>
                        <p>In a final observation, as the group broke up, the President remarked
                            that the U.S. considered Guinea a big small country.</p>
                        <p>The group then went out on the veranda off the Cabinet room for pictures,
                            followed by an introduction to Miss Caroline Kennedy, who was playing on
                            the lawn.</p>

                            Guinean development. He hoped concrete expression this interest would be
                            shown in discussion with President and that public statement could be
                            made following meeting that talks had covered problems of Guinea's
                            economic development in which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            prepared interest itself. Announcement any definite aid commitment would
                            set unfortunate precedent in regard President's meetings with other
                            distinguished foreign visitors and might aggravate Administration's
                            difficulties if made while Congress was still considering <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>63 aid appropriation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary also stressed importance economic assistance from other Western
                            industrialized nations and suggested proposed talk between two
                            Presidents would provide opening obtain such assistance. Hoped that
                            Conte and <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> would agree that
                            under circumstances main emphasis would be placed on fact that
                            conversations had taken place and other questions treated in subsidiary
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>Conte thanked Secretary for comments. He stated that although meeting
                            with President most important aspect of trip, possible public
                            announcements should convey impression <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> here to attend UNGA. Among several reasons for
                            this is fact Guinea having difficulties with SovBloc. Guinea had
                            oriented trade and economy toward Bloc. Furthermore, recently Bloc has
                            sought to meddle in Guinean internal affairs. Guinea's economic
                            situation difficult although not “dramatic.” US had been unable respond
                            to first Guinean overtures for aid immediately after independence; now
                            that new difficulties have arisen Guinea again turning to US.</p>
                        <p>Conte said he appreciated difficulty which precise statement on aid would
                            present for US. He had come to understand philosophy of US assistance
                            and understood President might not have authority make commitment until
                            Congress had acted on aid appropriation. He <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406"
                                facs="0434"/>intended fly Conakry next day to explain US position to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>. Since relations
                            between US and Guinea have greatly improved and further improvement
                            anticipated, Conte felt particularly important that possibility
                            misunderstanding be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said he encouraged by Conte's comments. Present Administration
                            had taken political risks to improve relations with Guinea; these appear
                            have paid off. Asst Sec <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                            pointed out Conte had also taken political risks in working improve
                            US-Guinea ties and therefore deserved much credit for present situation.
                            Secretary continued that improved relations would be further
                            justification for direct contact between two Presidents and also provide
                            good explanation for meeting. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> felt
                            meeting should in no way be interpreted as signifying some crisis
                            exists. On contrary, meeting useful step in normal development
                            international relations. Conte agreed. In closing, Secretary asked Conte
                            for early indication <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s

                        <p>The United States is providing the major portion of Western assist-ance
                            to Guinea. To date, total United States aid commitments in all
                            categories amount to just under $20 million, the majority of which has
                            been Food for Peace. The bulk of United States assistance commitments,
                            approximately $16 million, have been made in the past year, starting <pb
                                n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0435"/>with the aid offers made by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> in May 1961.
                            The offers, consisting of projects in the fields of education
                            (vocation), industry, power, public administration, agriculture, and
                            commodity imports, were well received by the Guineans and continue to be
                            the basis for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 and 1963
                            programs. At the time of the visit of the Guinean Ministerial Delegation
                            in May 1962, $2.5 million of balance of payments assist-ance for
                            commodity imports was added to the commitments previously made.
                            Implementation is now well under way with commodity deliveries being
                            made on a regular basis. With improvement of Guinea's relations with the
                            United States, Guinea in August 1962 requested a Peace Corps
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The objectives of the United States program in Guinea have been to lessen
                            Guinea's dependence on the Soviet Bloc and to stimulate private
                            investment from the West as one of the ways to start the country toward
                            economic development. It has become apparent that a measure of success
                            has been registered in these areas. The trend towards United States
                            sources of supply, using private importers, has been accelerating. An
                            Investment Code, encouraging private investment, has been promulgated by
                            the Guinean Government. Individual Guinean entrepreneurs are planning
                            various industrial enterprises in collaboration with United States
                            investors. An Industrial Growth program, financed by a United States
                            Development Grant, will shortly be activated for the purpose of
                            accelerating private investment.</p>

                        <p>The first assistance given by the United States to Guinea consisted of
                            $1.7 million of Title II <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 rice and
                            flour delivered in 1959. This was in response to an urgent request from
                            the country based on widespread rice crop failures. At the time of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s visit to the
                            United States in October 1959 a further United States offer consisting
                            of 150 scholarships and an English language teacher training program was
                            made. This offer was accepted and the program became operational during
                            the summer of 1960. Again in response to Guinean requests for assistance
                            $1 million of Section 402 rice, flour, and milk were made available to
                            Guinea from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 funds with deliveries
                            made in the spring of 1961. With the scholarship and English language
                            programs costed at a total of $1.1 million, cumulative United States
                            assistance up until the spring of 1961 was $3.8 million over the
                            preceding three years.</p>
                        <p>In April 1961, with the arrival of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2"
                                >Attwood</persName> in Guinea, a significant United States aid offer
                            was made to President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>
                            consisting of projects in the fields of education, public
                            administration, industry, power, and agriculture. These activities were
                            estimated to cost $2.5 million. In addition, $1 million of commodity
                            imports for balance of payments assistance was offered. A small dam and
                            a Peace Corps contingent were included in this aid offer but were not
                            accepted by Guinea at that <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0436"
                            />time. Negotiations were also begun for a three-year program to provide
                            Guinea with needed surplus agricultural commodities. These negotiations
                            were completed and agreements were signed in February 1962, providing
                            for $10.2 million worth of rice and flour over a three-year period. An
                            increment of $470,000 was added to this agreement in May 1962, providing
                            for deliveries of edible oil, milk and milk products. Also, at the time
                            of the visit of the Guinean Ministerial Delegation to Washington in May
                            1962 an additional $2.5 million for commodity imports balance of
                            payments assistance was made, thus bringing the total commodity import
                            assistance for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 to $3.5 million.
                            As of June 30, 1962, total obligations for that year were
                            $6,106,000.</p>
                        <p>Based on analysis by the Embassy and USAID, a program has been drawn up
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 which provides for a total of
                            $18,525,000 composed of $7 million for commodity imports, $2,535,000 in
                            development grants and $9 million of prospective development loans. It
                            is anticipated that in addition to the foregoing the value of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 Title I will be considerably
                            augmented by new Guinean requests for increased quantities of items
                            already provided for in that program, e.g., rice, flour, and milk as
                            well as the addition of new items such as meat, fruit, vegetables,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>The Guinean Government has drawn up a tentative list of import
                            requirements to be financed by the United States. This list, totaling
                            $30 million, was informally transmitted to USAID in Conakry on September
                            25. A preliminary analysis shows that a great many of the items
                            requested would be ineligible for United States financing because of
                            either the source of supply (France, Italy, West Germany) or the type of
                            item in question (luxury goods). It is possible that further discussions
                            over the coming weeks with the Guineans in Conakry will permit reduction
                            of this list to a hard core of essential commodities totaling $15-$18
                            million including Title I sales. Furthermore, the Guineans have included
                            in this import requirements list provision for certain equipment which
                            would be ineligible for financing as commodity imports but would rather
                            be included in project assistance either under development grants or
                            loans.</p>
                        <p>It is becoming apparent that one of the major United States objectives,
                            that of encouraging participation by both American and Guinean private
                            enterprise in the development of that country's economy, is being
                            accelerated considerably by the A.I.D. program. The signature of the
                            investment guaranty agreement in May 1962 has generated considerable
                            interest on the part of small, medium, and large United States investors
                            (Harvey Aluminum, Olin Mathieson, Pan American Airlines, etc.) and
                            several projects are now under active consideration in the mining and
                            manufacturing areas. Additionally, the United States financed commodity
                            import program has tended to encourage the Guineans to do their
                            importing through normal commercial channels. Activities (such <pb
                                n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0437"/>as feasibility surveys,
                            promotion of investment opportunities, training of Guinean
                            entrepreneurs, etc.) of American consulting engineering firms are being
                            launched and should be operational before the end of this calendar
                            year.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the conversation by assuring President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> of United States interest in
                            Africa and its problems, an interest, which he was sure President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> had already sensed in
                            his talks with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName>
                            and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>.
                            We believe that the interests of the United States are closely linked
                            with those of Africa. Consequently, we believe that increased stability,
                            increased economic <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0438"/>development,
                            a more intimate association of African nations and greater security in
                            Africa will lead to greater security in the Free World as a whole. As an
                            example of our interest, the President mentioned our efforts to bring
                            about stability in the Congo and our support of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to prevent the secession of Katanga. He
                            also cited our efforts to aid the African countries within the limits of
                            our own resources.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that he had been very interested in President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s speech at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on October 9, in particular the point he
                            had made on the drop in raw material prices, a development which was a
                            matter of concern not only to Africa but also to other parts of the
                            world such as Latin America. The decline has been very sharp over the
                            past three years and, unfortunately, gone far to wipe out the benefits
                            of aid the under-developed countries have been receiving from the United
                            States and other nations. In Latin America the drop in the price of
                            certain commodities, such as coffee and bananas, has led to a decrease
                            in the stand-ard of living despite foreign aid. This is a major economic
                            problem for the under-developed countries and therefore should receive
                            greater attention from the industrially advanced nations. The President
                            stated that we are trying to persuade the countries associated in the
                            Common Market and the other nations of Western Europe to open up their
                            wealth for products of the under-developed countries and we are seeking
                            commodity agreements for the stabilization of prices. Furthermore, we
                            are endeavoring to encourage private capital to invest in the
                            under-developed nations and to further the industrialization of those
                            countries so that they will not be dependent on one or two basic
                            commodities. The President said that these are problems which should
                            concern all industrially developed nations as well as countries like
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded his opening remarks by asking President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s opinion on the possibilities
                            for increased unity among the African countries, pointing out that such
                            unity would permit the African countries to play a greater role in
                            resolving problems of mutual concern such as the Congo.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> did not comment on
                            the President's remarks regarding raw material prices. With respect to
                            African unity, he said that Guinea had taken various steps. Contacts
                            with other African Governments had made clear that they are unanimous in
                            their support for greater unity, and he predicted that this will become
                            increasingly evident in the coming months. A greater cooperation among
                            the African nations will lead to greater confidence and provide greater
                            possibilities for the rapid economic and social development of the
                            Continent. All African countries, President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> stated, are in agreement that the terms of unity
                            should respect the institutions and traditions of each country and that
                            cooperation among them should be centered in the cultural and economic
                            fields. Guinea, he said, is pleased to see that the United States
                            recognizes <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0439"/>the need for and
                            favors greater African unity, for a divided Africa would be detrimental
                            to world peace.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> continued that his
                            present visit to the United States demonstrates the sincere desire of
                            the Guinean Government and the people to cooperate with the United
                            States, and that they are very happy at the understanding that has been
                            established between the two countries. He wished to pay tribute to the
                            Administration for removing various misconceptions which had existed
                            about Guinea and its Government. He also paid tribute to the work of

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> said that Guinea
                            is a small underpopulated country, but along with other African nations
                            has many big problems. The countries of Africa now find themselves at a
                            crossroads, with various routes open. Guinea's choice will depend on how
                            rapidly it can move to meet its human needs. First efforts after
                            independence were to consolidate the bases of the new State. The
                            evolution of the nations of Africa has not followed the same pattern as
                            in Europe. In the older countries, economic organization preceded the
                            State. In Africa, the State must create the nation. During the colonial
                            period the countries of Africa were divided in such a way that
                            traditional ethnic groups were separated from one another. The Guinean
                            Government has sought to create a viable State, and for this political
                            action is indispensable in order that all ethnic groups may share the
                            same goals. Certain people have criticized the Guineans or have harbored
                            certain misconceptions about them. This has occasioned difficulties for
                            the Guineans, but thanks to the efforts of men <pb n="412"
                                xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"/>of goodwill, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> believed that Guinea's position
                            is now more clearly understood. Today, the bases of the State have been
                            created. Although Guinea, like other African countries, has pressing
                            economic problems, the Guinean people have faith in themselves and are
                            prepared to make every sacrifice in the development of their
                            country.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> asserted his
                            Government must now deal with human needs: the people must have adequate
                            food and adequate housing, the sick must be cared for and the illiterate
                            taught—these are the main preoccupations of his Government. To meet
                            these needs, Guinea must have the cooperation of other countries, and
                            Guinea attaches great importance to the cooperation of the United
                            States. President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> hoped
                            that this cooperation would develop further: that is his desire and the
                            desire of the Guinean people. Guinea has many latent possibilities. It
                            is a country of great economic diversity, since most of the natural
                            resources found elsewhere in Africa also exist in Guinea. With respect
                            to industrialization, Guinea possesses enough; necessary raw materials,
                            and its power resources only need to be developed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> said he wished to
                            suggest that the United States aid take various forms. The assistance
                            thus far received has been extremely useful, particularly in 1961 when
                            Guinea was suffering from a severe draught and the United States
                            generously made food available. He hoped that American aid can be
                            broadened and diversified, thus permitting the further development of
                            his country.</p>
                        <p>After mentioning the reasons why Guinea had initially turned to the East
                            for assistance and summarizing the difficulties which had arisen in
                            dealing with the Bloc (covered in separate memorandum),<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d265fn1">The two leaders' discussion of Guinea's experience
                                with bloc aid and Franco-Guinean relations on October 10 was
                                recorded in two memoranda of conversation. (Ibid.)</note> President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> expressed his concern
                            about the execution of the three-year development plan. He was, he said,
                            fearful that it would be unsuccessful despite its modest nature and the
                            full support being given to it by the Guinean people. For example, the
                            plan gives priority to infrastructure projects such as aviation, a
                            printing plant, schools and health facilities. This is all well, but
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> is worried
                            whether there will be enough food for his people. Agricultural
                            production has declined, and this was also true in the industrial
                            sector. To illustrate the point, he said, that although Guinea produces
                            large quantities of coconuts and palm kernels, serious shortages of soap
                            and edible oils exist. This situation also has a political aspect, for
                            the Guinean people wish the plan to succeed. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> therefore would like to see more
                            vegetable oils proc-essed in Guinea in order that his country can meet
                            some, if not all, of its needs for these products. Also, he would like
                            more soap to be produced locally from domestic raw materials, thereby
                            eliminating the depend-ence <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"
                            />upon imported soap. He added that these two sectors had been neglected
                            by the Socialist countries in their aid program for Guinea. He did not
                            consider it necessary to give all the reasons why these projects would
                            be of great value to Guinea, but felt strongly, that if carried out,
                            they would show the Guinean people that something is being done for
                            their country.</p>
                        <p>With respect to current and future United States aid, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> said he wished to suggest three
                            forms it might take: <list>

                                    and continued assistance would be very useful;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Assistance to small firms and enterprises which do not require
                                    large capital but do need equipment. This type of aid, he
                                    suggested, could be carried out through joint cooperation—the
                                    United States providing equipment and Guinea the manpower and
                                    local costs. Americans could even manage the enterprises until
                                    the investment has been amortized. President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> believed that this kind
                                    of assistance would have considerable impact, not only in Guinea
                                    but also in other parts of Africa for the latter would see for
                                    themselves that Guinea does not permit “certain nations” to
                                    introduce systems it does not wish. Guinea has been able to
                                    resist this type of pressure from the Bloc because of the
                                    stability of its institutions, but there are other countries
                                    which do not possess the same capacity to resist;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Large scale economic development projects. In 1960 the United
                                    States Government had sent a message to Guinea expressing its
                                    interest in the Konkoure dam project. President <persName
                                        corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> believed that the
                                    completion of the Konkoure dam would lead to the establishment
                                    of many small enterprises. Guinea has great potential power
                                    resources, but at present many villages lack electricity, and
                                    power is very expensive. Guinea therefore attaches major
                                    importance to the project. During his visit to the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> the Soviet Government had
                                    told President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> that
                                    it favored the project, and a communique to that effect had been
                                    issued. However, his experiences with <gloss target="#t_FRIA1"
                                        >FRIA</gloss> had shown him what complications and technical
                                    difficulties might develop if the Russians were to take charge
                                    of the project, and he therefore had decided not to carry out
                                    the agreement with the Soviets. If the United States were
                                    willing to help build the dam, its assistance might come from
                                    the United States Government direct or from private American
                                    firms or from national or international banks.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> then mentioned
                            several other projects of importance in the development of his country.
                            He first alluded to the railroads, stating that they are over 65 years
                            old and no longer capable of transporting the country's products. The
                            highway system must also be improved, and he would like to see 3000-4000
                            km. of roads surfaced in oil or asphalt. As illustration, he said, that
                            despite the fact that there are miles and miles of natural palm
                            plantations, less than a third of the crop ever reaches the market.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> said he realized
                            that the United States Government always wishes to have plans before it
                            is prepared to discuss individual projects. He therefore asked that
                            American technicians be sent to Guinea <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414"
                                facs="0442"/>to draw up the necessary plans with their Guinean
                            counterparts. Some highway plans have already been prepared, but he
                            would like them also to be studied by United States experts before these
                            projects are started.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> reiterated the
                            importance of setting up small firms to make soap and edible oils and to
                            process and crush palm kernels. In reply to the President's question, he
                            indicated that the soap produced would be for domestic consumption.</p>
                        <p>Another problem is education. President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> expressed gratitude for the <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> projects already started, mentioning
                            the vocational school and the school of administration. He said that
                            1600 Guineans are presently studying abroad, of whom 130 are in the
                            United States. As he had mentioned in his speech at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the lack of trained manpower is acute in
                            most countries of Africa. After alluding to his reluctance to send young
                            Guineans to the Bloc countries for technical training (covered in
                            separate memorandum) President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> said he strongly favored the establishment of
                            training schools in Africa. This would permit students to remain in
                            their own environment and thus not lose contact with the people of their
                            country; would not expose them to alien political ideologies; and,
                            finally, would represent a financial saving for the African countries.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> therefore hoped
                            that the proposal he had made at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            for the establishment of African universities would have the support of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>With regard to health and sanitation, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> said that Guinea is encountering
                            great difficulties in combating various diseases. He had therefore
                            established a health program which will utilize teachers, doctors and
                            technicians provided by the Peace Corps. The matter is presently being
                            discussed in Conakry with representatives of the Peace Corps, and the
                            latter will soon return to the United States with the Guinean proposals.
                            Peace Corps assistance would, he concluded, be of importance to
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The President said he could well understand the economic problems facing
                            a country like Guinea which sells raw materials at wholesale prices and
                            must import finished goods at retail prices. This, of course, leads to a
                            balance of payments problem. The United States is also having its own
                            balance of payments difficulties. We bear a heavy international
                            financial burden, and while it does not have serious effects on our
                            domestic economy, it does create a serious balance of payments problem.
                            This limits the amount of funds at our disposal for foreign aid. The
                            Soviet Bloc has an easier time. In Latin America, for example, they
                            concentrate on Cuba alone, while we are trying to help all the other
                            countries of the Hemisphere. As regards the French, the bulk of their
                            assistance is directed toward Africa and, furthermore, it does not
                            create a payments problem because all of their aid is tied to the
                            franc.</p>
                        <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>The President said he believed the United States should do everything it
                            can to help Guinea, and as evidence of this desire cited our aid during
                            the past 12 months. He stressed, however, that our whole foreign aid
                            program constitutes a very heavy burden. For example, in 1961 we gave
                            $1.6 billion in economic aid. We were happy thus to assist others, but
                            it did put a drain on our dollar reserves. The President continued that
                            these have dropped by about $12 billion during the past four years. We
                            have given over $80 billion in aid in the past 15 years, with most of it
                            going to Europe, and we therefore hope that Europe will now meet its
                            responsibilities in assisting the under-developed countries. Europe also
                            receives a large amount of dollars through United States defense
                            expenditures. For example, we spend about $350 million in France on
                            defense. This means that one third of France's dollar surplus comes from
                            defense expenditures. The President stressed that this situation can not
                            continue indefinitely, and we feel that the other countries must bear
                            their share.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had wished to explain our financial position
                            because of his interest in Africa and in Guinea's success. He thought
                            that the United States had made a mistake when it did not respond to
                            Guinea's request for aid at the time it became independent. We cannot,
                            however, he concluded, do as much as we would like because of the
                            balance of payments situation he had just outlined.</p>

                        <p>The President welcomed Minister Conte and asked him how it felt to be
                            back in the United States. The Minister replied that it seemed as though
                            he had never left. In reply to the President's further question,
                            Minister Conte said that he had a great deal of work to do in Guinea
                            since he is responsible for education and youth affairs, but that he
                            found it very exciting.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked after President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName>. Minister Conte said that his President was very
                            well, that they had left Guinea on the same day, himself to Washington
                            and the President on his way to Nigeria but that he should be back in
                            Guinea by now.</p>
                        <p>Minister Conte said that he was very happy to be back in Washington and
                            to have a chance to see his many good friends here. He explained that
                            his Government and President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> had asked him to come to the United States on a
                            mission of friendship, and that he brought with him a message from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. His visit marks the
                            occasion of the opening of the American Fair in Guinea which the
                            Guineans consider to be a major event and to which they attach great
                            importance. He also wished to take advantage of his trip here to go over
                            economic relations between Guinea and the United States. He added that
                            the Government of Guinea would be happy to receive any representatives
                            to the Fair that the United States Government might care to send. He
                            said that the Government of Guinea was very pleased to learn that Mr.
                            Shriver had been appointed as representative, and was looking forward to
                            having both Mr. and Mrs. Shriver in Conakry. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> said that he understood that
                            Mrs. Shriver would be unable to go to Guinea as she had previously
                            accepted an engagement to deliver a speech at that time under the
                            auspices of the Mental Health Foundation. The President said he would
                            look into the matter.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Minister Conte about Guinea's economy. Minister
                            Conte replied that it is getting off the ground, but that the situation
                            is not brilliant. There are serious economic problems as President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> had described on his
                            most recent visit to the United States and these difficulties are
                            increasing because Guinea's relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and, as a matter of fact, all the Bloc countries are
                            poor and are getting even worse.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired as to the percentage of Guinea's exports going to
                            the Bloc. Minister Conte said it was difficult to give an exact figure
                            but he estimated it at around 30% to 35% and that it might be as high as
                            40%. This is Guinea's great problem, because this 40% cannot be sold
                            elsewhere to earn hard currency and, thus, in effect, is blocked.
                            Therefore, a considerable part of Guinea's production is mortgaged for
                            some time ahead since it has long-term credit arrangements with the Bloc
                            based on barter agreements. In reply to a further question Minister
                            Conte said that arrears to the Bloc covering the last three years amount
                            to some <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>$40 million to $48
                            million; and, of course, these arrears continue to accumulate from year
                            to year.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired about Guinea's relations with France. The
                            Minister said that a French mission had visited Guinea and the
                            Government of Guinea had sent one mission to France. The two governments
                            are now examining the points at issue between them, and the Government
                            of Guinea believes that they will soon reach a solution. He pointed out
                            that since 1958 Guinea has received no aid at all from France, and
                            moreover, that Guinea had had to pay out of its own funds military
                            pensions which the French Government should have paid. France owes
                            Guinea some G.Fr. 6 billion, i.e., $24 million, for these pensions.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to relations with the Bloc, the President asked how Guinea
                            expected to pay off its debt to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. The Minister answered that Guinea cannot mortgage all
                            of its exports, because it must live and thus export elsewhere to earn
                            hard currency. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been told
                            and the latter must understand that this is a credit which Guinea will
                            pay off within its production capabilities, but that some of the
                            production must be used to earn hard currency.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how Guinea planned to earn hard currency to improve
                            its balance of payments. Minister Conte said that Guinea hopes to do it
                            in three ways: 1) When their differences with France are settled, the
                            $24 million owed by France will be paid over; 2) By increasing
                            agricultural and mineral production. In this connection the Government
                            of Guinea and <gloss target="#t_FRIA1">FRIA</gloss> have agreed that
                                <gloss target="#t_FRIA1">FRIA</gloss> is to increase its output this
                            year, thus increasing Guinea's earnings; 3) Through aid from friendly
                            countries. He mentioned that besides <gloss target="#t_FRIA1"
                                >FRIA</gloss>, Guinea is now negotiating with the Harvey Aluminum
                            Company for the export of bauxite.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what products Guinea exports to the Bloc. Minister
                            Conte replied that they largely consist of agricultural products such as
                            coffee and bananas.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired what Guinea received from the Bloc in return. The
                            Minister replied that this was a real problem for Guinea. The Bloc
                            furnishes some food products, but mostly equipment, and the difficulty
                            is that the Bloc equipment is not suited to Guinea's climate. In fact,
                            it is not unusual to see Soviet equipment lying alongside the roads
                            because it does not work. He said that the principal types of equipment
                            supplied were tractors, vehicles and maintenance equipment. The most
                            serious problem is with the vehicles; they do not work at all. The
                            result is that Guinea is losing on two counts: first, because exports
                            don't earn foreign exchange, and secondly because the equipment can't be
                            used. He added that Guinea has made this quite clear to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> said that we are
                            trying to do what we can to help Guinea solve its economic problems. He
                            said that he takes a great interest in Guinea; he was aware of problems
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to its still <pb
                                n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0446"/>unsettled differences with
                            France, and appreciated both put Guinea at a disadvantage. We are trying
                            to do what we can, although we may not have been able to do as much as
                            we would like. We are trying to obtain enough dollars to be able to meet
                            our responsibilities around the world. We are hopeful that we can do
                            something for Guinea, but we must wait to see what action the Congress
                            will take. He trusted that the negotiations with France will work out as
                            this would be very helpful. For our part, the President repeated we
                            shall do what we can for Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Minister Conte thanked the President and said that Guinea realizes that
                            the United States has many commitments around the world, and is most
                            grateful for what the United States has done for it. Guinea is asking
                            for more assistance, but it is because Guinea believes that it has given
                            proof of its courage and because Guinea believes that a nation must
                            first help itself. The purpose of foreign assistance is to help a nation
                            to help itself. For this reason, American aid helps Guinea increase its
                            own efforts. He then expressed the Government of Guinea's thanks to the
                            United States Government and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> for
                            their assistance which, he said, has been very effective. He concluded
                            by handing the President a letter from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President thanked Minister Conte for the message and asked him to
                            convey his best regards to President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"

                        <p>The meeting in the Governor's office yesterday was for the most part a
                            belaboring of the obvious, with some confusion thrown in. However, we
                            finally formulated a short-range line of action with which I hope you
                            will agree.</p>
                        <p>By way of background, you probably are aware that Sargent Shriver has
                            done an excellent job of convincing the town that the time had indeed
                                <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>arrived when Guinea will
                            make a clean break with the Bloc. Ambassador Bangoura made calls
                            yesterday on both <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> and
                            Hutchison, taking the same line, saying the break (“de couper”) will
                            come soon and that they are depending on the U.S. to step in and fill
                            the gap. Neither Shriver, <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName>
                            nor Bangoura have given any indication as to the actual timing of the
                            “break,” nor how <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName>
                            plans to do it. This of course is something for <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> himself to decide on his own.
                            Assuming that the break does come, we should take great care not to give
                            the impression that we are calling the shots.</p>
                        <p>If we do decide to move in, we face a dilemma as to how and with what we
                            should do it. We do not know the extent of the Bloc aid programs. The
                            Guineans have always been very secretive about it. When I asked if the
                            Guineans probably would not be more forthcoming now that they plan a
                            break, <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> and the others
                            doubted very seriously that the Guineans knew enough about Bloc
                            assistance themselves to be very helpful. Apparently <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> himself is totally ignorant about
                            foreign assistance to Guinea, whether it be Bloc or non-Bloc—he simply
                            does not and will not understand it.</p>
                        <p>Most of the discussion centered about a possible letter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> from the President. The majority
                            of those present had bought <persName corresp="#p_AWH2"
                                >Attwood</persName>'s suggestion that the President should reiterate
                            existing aid programs and cite a figure (e.g., $31 million). The
                            Governor overruled them on this, strongly supported by me. I said I saw
                            no reason why the President should reiterate in a letter a list of
                            programs which have already been publicly announced, and that there were
                            obvious dangers in citing the $31 million figure which, as the Governor
                            had said, would lend itself to very unfortunate interpretations. If
                            there were to be a letter at all, it should be one that would express
                            the President's sentiments in general terms, but in such a way as to
                            inspire <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s confidence in our
                            intentions should Guinea face difficulties in the future. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_TWC1">Trimble</persName> has just read me the first
                            draft which isn't bad. I will have it shortly.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> leaves for Addis on May 21
                            (Tuesday) where <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName> thinks he
                            may make a strong pro-Western statement. Any letter we send, therefore,
                            should go out over the weekend. We will have no control over what
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> says at Addis and in
                            the light of his past his statement, if unrestrained, might be damaging
                            to our posture with other African states. This is why the President's
                            letter should be reassuring but not so much so that it will appear that
                            we have, on such short notice, rushed in pell-mell to replace the
                            Bloc.</p>
                        <p>The important conclusion of the meeting—to which I personally agreed—was
                            that the President should send <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> a letter over the weekend which would be drafted
                            along the general lines set forth above. As you know, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> has asked for a Presidential
                            letter and knows that <persName corresp="#p_AWH2">Attwood</persName><pb
                                n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0448"/>has recommended it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName> is calling a meeting to draft
                            such a letter today, which they will then send to the White House for

                                commitment to Guinea during the previous 18 months had totaled $31
                                million, of which only about $6 million had been expended, but
                                pointed out that public announcement of this figure in the
                                President's letter might have had a negative effect on the
                                economy-minded U.S. Congress. (Telegram 747 from Conakry, May 20;

                        <p>In addition, an instruction is being sent to the Country Team in Conakry
                            to get more specifics on exactly what the U.S. should do if Guinea
                            breaks with the Bloc and, hopefully, some idea as to timing. Everyone at
                            the meeting yesterday agreed it would be foolish to go ahead when we are
                            still uncertain as to exactly what the situation is that we are facing.
                            It was felt that we should go slowly and respond readily to requests for
                            short-term assistance—e.g., Guinea needs rice, and this we can furnish
                            quickly and easily, and we should say so in the letter.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I have laid on a requirement with <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> to prepare a paper telling us absolutely everything
                            they know about Bloc programs in Guinea. This we should have

                        <p>After reading the letter, the President expressed his appreciation and
                            added that he was well aware of the problems which exist in South Africa
                            and Portugal. He noted that even though the U.S. is allied with Portugal
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we have actively urged
                            Portugal to accept the principle of self-determination for its colonies.
                            For the past year, we have consistently pursued this policy. Our
                            relations with Portugal have become strained as a result of these
                            efforts. And because our relations with Portugal are now more strained
                            than ever, we probably do not have much influence left which we can
                            bring to bear on this issue. We have supported the policy of
                            self-determination and we believe that sooner or later Portugal must
                            also see the light. It is not only a question of what the U.S. can do,
                            but also of what other European countries will be willing to do. There
                            is an added difficulty in that, if we exert too much influence upon
                            Portugal, she may seek the support of other European countries. If so,
                            she might receive a measure of support from some of them. We are very
                            dependent upon our defense installations in the Azores. However, on the
                            question of the Portuguese possessions in Africa, we have acted in
                            accordance with our principles.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to South Africa, which, he said, seems to pose
                            a more difficult problem. While, in the case of Portugal, one could feel
                            that she would adopt a more progressive attitude in the future, this was
                            not the case with respect to South Africa. The President pointed out
                            that he had clarified his position on this subject in his recent press
                            conference. He expressed his concern that neither expulsions from world
                            organizations nor sanctions would change the policy of South Africa. He
                            feared, he said, that such actions would do for the U.N. what Abyssinia
                            had done for the League of Nations. Another effect would be to create
                            demands for similar pressures against Cuba. If sanctions were applied to
                            South Africa, the American public would ask why the same measures could
                            not be applied against Cuba. The President noted that he had discussed
                            this question yesterday with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> who would present the U.S. policy on South
                            Africa and the Portuguese territories at the U.N. The President felt
                            that the world organization ought not to proceed according to Chapter 7
                            of the U.N. Charter in regard to South Africa because “the situation
                            there was different.” The President noted that he <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>had used the expression “threat to
                            peace” in his recent press conference in which he discussed South
                            Africa. However, the President said he had reread his own statement on
                            this subject. The United States favors proceeding according to Chapter 6
                            of the U.N. Charter, and he hoped Guinea would be able to support this
                            position. The President assured Diallo that the matter is receiving his
                            very close attention. He had discussed these subjects with President
                            Nyerere of Tanganyika this very week, and he is well aware of the strong
                            feelings the African people have on these issues. Nonetheless, he said,
                            it is difficult for us to preach to others about racial discrimination
                            when we still have so many unresolved problems in our own country. The
                            United States Government is opposed to discrimination, and we will,
                            therefore, continue to act as we have in the past. The President added
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> and
                            Ambassador Diallo would undoubtedly keep in contact on this subject. He
                            again expressed his appreciation for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName>'s letter, and said that he
                            would send a reply to it.</p>
                        <p>After thanking the President, Diallo said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> had entrusted him with three
                            tasks in addition to delivering his message to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>. The first was to clarify the
                            Guinean view on a number of points of direct interest to Guinea and the
                            United States. The second task was to give the President any additional
                            information or documents concerning the Addis Ababa Conference that he
                            might require. Finally, if the President had any suggestions or
                            proposals to present to <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou
                                Toure</persName>, the Ambassador would be happy to convey these to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Diallo added that he would like to stress that his mission was
                            an additional proof of the personal confidence which Toure has in the
                            President and that Guinea is grateful for the assistance extended by the
                            U.S. Having himself been Ambassador in Washington for three years, he
                            was greatly impressed by the improvement in U.S.-Guinea relations.
                            However, he noted that, since relations between Guinea and the United
                            States had begun to improve, a press campaign, led by Agence France
                            Presse, had attempted to block this development. At Addis Ababa,
                            immediately after an announcement of U.S. aid to Guinea, <gloss
                                target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> had reported that Guinea's
                            representative at the conference had opposed President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s racial policy. Prior to
                            leaving Conakry Ambassador Diallo had been instructed by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> to enlist the
                            full support of the African Chiefs of State for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s policy which <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> himself fully endorsed.
                            Diallo said that Toure felt this issue was sufficiently important to
                            instruct the Guinea delegation to seek out the U.S. Ambassador at Addis
                            in order to inform him of <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Agence France Presse (<gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss>) also referred
                            to an agreement between the Soviet Union and Guinea for a regular air
                            service. However, relations between Guinea and the U.S. were such that
                            Guinea would never do anything <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0451"
                            />like this without prior consultation with the U.S. The purpose of this
                                <gloss target="#t_AFP1">AFP</gloss> campaign is that some elements
                            in France do not look with favor upon the improvement of relations
                            between the U.S. and Guinea. They would like to see Guinea reintegrated
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UAM1">UAM</gloss>. This is not possible.
                            Relations with France must be conducted on the basis of full equality
                            and frank cooperation as they are with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> had asked
                            him to say that he had been happy to support the President's racial
                            policy in October 1962 when he came to the U.S. and that he again wishes
                            to congratulate the President and his brother for all they had done in
                            this field.</p>
                        <p>Finally with respect to Gizenga, Diallo stated that Guinean leadership
                            had been grateful for the interest shown by the President in that
                            matter. Total reconciliation in the Congo is indispensable for progress
                            and President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> will do
                            all he can to achieve that end. Because President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> has voiced his concern
                            regarding intervention on this matter, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> wishes to assure him that
                            before taking such action <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>
                            would make absolutely certain that Gizenga is “recuperable” and that he
                            could perform a constructive role. <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> would appreciate any suggestions the President
                            might care to make.</p>
                        <p>Diallo Telli said that whenever President <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"
                                >Toure</persName> traveled in Africa, he noted that the people were
                            very emotionally involved in the problems of the Portuguese colonies and
                            South Africa. Because of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName>'s responsibilities and the hopes placed in him
                            by the Africans, the President should do something, otherwise the
                            African governments would be forced by their people to take extreme
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated the importance of having other African countries
                            exert their influence, specifically the African countries of the French
                            Community. He said that our influence was now very slight. Portugal
                            would not want to become isolated. The President's personal feeling was
                            that Portugal would probably see the light when it would be too
                            late.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded by indicating that he would write to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> on the various
                            questions discussed at the meeting. In this letter he would also address
                            himself to the problem of civil aviation in Guinea. The President again
                            stressed the importance of having other European countries bring their
                            influence to bear upon Portugal because otherwise it would appear that
                            Portugal was pitted against the U.S. as well as Africa. At the present
                            time, Europe was very sensitive to U.S. influence. President
                                <persName>De Gaulle</persName> had rallied the forces of European
                            nationalism against U.S. influence in Europe. France and the French
                            Community could do a great deal on the Portuguese issue, even if Guinea
                            could not do very much. The President reassured his visitor that his
                            interest in this issue would remain constant.</p>

                            indicated that the issue is being resolved. The major problem, as Loeb
                            says, is educating Toure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName>'s unhappiness reflected
                            primarily his confusing counterpart (local currency generated by dollar
                            financed commodity imports) and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            480-generated local currency. Contrary to his belief, counterpart (about
                            $5 million per year in Guinea francs) is totally available to the Guinea
                            Government for development purposes and this should satisfy Toure, when
                            explained. The restrictions Toure complained about apply instead to
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 local currency. It is US-owned
                            with 51% available to the Government of Guinea in loans that are
                            virtually grants (40 year—3/4%); 25% for private industry loans, and 24%
                            for US Government use (Embassy expenses, etc.). <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss> 480 to date is about $20 million.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the main point of <persName corresp="#p_TAS1"

                                >Toure</persName>'s complaint. Guinea is in desperate economic shape
                            and, for the first time <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Toure</persName> is
                            concentrating with some realism on his economic problems. He wants the
                            largest amount of visible, “meat and potatoes” development projects,
                            particularly to stem the political unrest. To this end he is trying to
                            make peace with the French, improve the climate for private investment,
                            and to control spending. He is putting together an ambitious and
                            probably impractical new economic development plan and is tentatively
                            sending a mission over here to talk about increased aid the beginning of
                            December. Our problem is to keep our aid commitment down to sensible
                            limits without Toure getting so disillusioned he turns back to the

                                re-established his personal authority in Ethiopia after a bloody

                                his regime in December 1960. Nevertheless, the Emperor's position
                                was, if only briefly, seriously challenged, and he is confronted
                                with serious problems involving the rebuilding of his
                                Administration, and over the longer run, the stability of Ethiopia

                            <item>The abortive coup appears to have been intramural in character;
                                the active protagonists on both sides came almost exclusively from
                                the small Amhara ruling group and its supporters. Fighting took
                                place between the Imperial Body Guard and the army, the principal
                                military components upon which <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile
                                    Selassie</persName> had depended for the retention of his power.
                                However, the immediate consequences of the short struggle and its
                                implications for the future suggest that it was more significant
                                than a “palace revolt.” In addition to the blatant and
                                well-publicized challenge to his authority suffered by the Emperor,
                                many of his most trusted ministers and advisers have been
                                assassinated, his Imperial Body Guard and the security services have
                                been proved unreliable, and his doubts concerning the competence and
                                resolution of the Crown Prince have been confirmed. Most
                                importantly, the way in which the revolt unfolded dramatized the
                                existence of social and political discontent at key points in the
                                Empire's social structure.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The issue which sparked the coup appears to have been the
                                dissatisfaction of the Imperial Body Guard officers with their low
                                pay and what they felt to be their declining status in the military
                                hierarchy. Nevertheless, there exists a wider range of dissidence in
                                the country, arising from a more complex set of factors. These
                                include dissatisfaction of some middle level government officials
                                with His Imperial Majesty's autocratic rule, and the thwarted
                                aspirations of the growing number of young “modernists” and western
                                educated intellectuals for more rapid social and economic advance.
                                The Body Guard leaders probably anticipated support from large
                                numbers of civil servants, army, and police officers. However,
                                initial alarm at the audacity of the undertaking, realization that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> was not in
                                full eclipse, and most important, the unpopularity of several plot
                                leaders probably prevented the rebels from gaining the support they
                                anticipated. Since the attempted coup was engineered by a small
                                segment of the ruling group, and because the revolt was quickly
                                snuffed out, there was neither inclination nor opportunity for
                                discontent among civilian elements to manifest itself. Moreover,
                                coup leaders approached the important army and air force commanders
                                only after the initiation of the coup, and failed to secure their
                                support. The longstanding prestige of the Emperor almost certainly
                                had its effect in limiting enthusiasm for the attempted revolt.
                                Ultimately, <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0455"/>it was the
                                vigorous action of the armed forces in putting down the rebellion
                                that was the decisive factor.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Although <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> has
                                indicated that he intends to deal charitably with opponents who did
                                not directly lead the revolt and who are now willing to make public
                                apology, the experience will almost certainly reinforce his penchant
                                for a constant shuffling of top government officials. He must not
                                only replace those who were murdered by the rebels—a slow and
                                difficult task—but is likely to continue his longstanding practice
                                of assigning potential troublemakers abroad and making frequent
                                shifts of cabinet ministers and other high officers. A number of the
                                Emperor's advisers and aides perished in the coup or are under
                                suspicion, and this will reinforce his customary practice of using a
                                variety of foreign advisers of miscellaneous nationalities. The
                                ineffectual perform-ance of the Crown Prince has almost certainly
                                reinforced the Emperor's grave doubts about him as a successor.
                                However, there are no clearly qualified alternative candidates, and
                                the Emperor will probably be in no hurry to name a
                                substitute.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Security measures will almost certainly be tightened, and the
                                Emperor's suspicions of the more progressive of his civil servants
                                will almost certainly persist. Nevertheless, pressures by the latter
                                for major reforms probably will grow. The Emperor faces the dilemma
                                whether he should seek to control these “modernist” elements by
                                somewhat more concessions to their point of view or should rely on
                                traditionalist supporters and thus risk further alienation of the
                                literate class. On the whole, we do not anticipate any massive

                                intentions under precisely such emergency conditions, has probably
                                been reassured by the assistance rendered by the US for the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Nitze</hi>: In view of the fact that we
                            have recently authorized our Ambassador in Ethiopia to proceed with
                            negotiations for the additional facilities desired by the Department of

                            Ethiopia. A copy of telegram 389 from the Embassy at Mogadiscio is
                                enclosed.<note n="1" xml:id="d272fn1">Not printed. In telegram 389,
                                February 21, <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                                reported that Ethiopia had been deeply affected by the unsuccessful
                                coup of December 1960 and would never be the same again. He noted
                                that in the minds of many forward looking Ethiopians, U.S.
                                assistance to the Ethiopian army had aided in maintaining what had
                                become an unpopular regime, and that if a revolution should occur in
                                the near future, there was reason for concern that Americans might
                                be among those attacked. (Ibid., 775.00/2-2161)</note></p>

                            impressions are consistent with our own analysis. It is clear that there
                            is a very real danger that political developments in the Horn of Africa
                            over the next few years may result in limitations on our freedom of
                            action at Kagnew Station or even in demands for its evacuation.
                            Therefore, although we are presently in a relatively good political
                            position in Ethiopia, I believe it would be only prudent <pb n="429"
                                xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>for the interested agencies to begin

                            way relax our efforts to preserve the status of this valuable facility—I
                            am simply calling attention to a contingency which it would be

                        <p>The Somali Republic may soon seek military aid from the Soviet Union and
                            Czechoslovakia: there have been new Ethiopian incursions into tacitly
                            neutralized border areas; a recent major Cabinet crisis has weakened the
                            government; and Somali officials have been unhappy with the
                            implementation of Western military and budgetary aid. The Somali Army
                            Commander recently appealed to his government for arms “regardless of
                            source.” Prime Minister Abdirascid discussed the Somali military program
                            with Bloc officials in June, but sought no military aid commitments at
                            that time.</p>

                                >UK</gloss>-Italian discussions of a coordinated military supply and
                            training program for the Somalis have dragged on without concrete
                            results. Only small deliveries of Italian military supplies have been
                            made. During Somali President Aden Abdulla Osman's visit to Rome en
                            route to the Belgrade Conference, Italy reaffirmed its intention to
                            supply Somali arms requirements. However, the details remain to be
                            worked out, and the extent of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            participation is uncertain.</p>
                        <p>The Italian Parliament has adjourned without legislative action on
                            Italy's major share of the tripartite Western (Italy, US, and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) budgetary aid agreed upon in principle
                            late in 1960. Final action by Italy is not expected until late
                            September. A crisis in financing Somali Government operations may be
                            expected by November.</p>

                            developments suggest that Western prestige is declining steadily as a
                            result of the prolonged delays in providing aid. Radical Somali elements
                            contrast the West's plans for assistance with those of the <gloss

                            unusually large-scale economic aid in June. The acceptance of Bloc
                            offers at that time was a concession to strong, neutralist factions
                            which continue to exert pressure upon the unsteadily based Abdirascid
                            government. Any introduction of Bloc arms into the explosive
                            Somali-Ethiopian border situation would seriously increase instability
                            in the Horn of Africa and aggravate US and Western difficulties in
                            balancing Somali and Ethiopian demands for support.</p>

                        <p>Sir Roger remarked that if two years ago anyone had asked where trouble
                            was most apt to arise in Africa the answer inevitably would have been
                            “in the Horn”. The absence of that trouble was no cause for
                            self-congratulation, however. The problems are intractable and trouble
                            is standing in the wings. The West had to be particularly careful not to
                            appear to favor one side or the other since the side which felt
                            neglected would inevitably turn toward the East. While other African
                            countries certainly did not regard them as the leaders in any movement,
                            because of their geographical position Communist penetration of either
                            would probably result in the spreading of the infection to all of the
                            adjoining areas in Africa.</p>
                        <p>The problem is further complicated by the racial difficulties involved in
                            the territorial overlapping of the Somali people. The Governor of Kenya,
                            for example, felt that the most difficult problem facing that new nation
                            was the resolution of the question involving the Somali people in
                            Northern Kenya. The British definitely did not intend to alter
                            territorial boundaries prior to independence. Furthermore, he was happy
                            to say, the Somali Government was not pressing them particularly in this
                            regard. However, the British were advising all important Kenyan
                            political leaders that the Somali section of their country held little
                            but trouble for them in the future. There was little indication so far
                            that any future Kenyan Government would be willing to part with this
                            area. On <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>the other hand, if one
                            should show any such inclination, the problems of the area would be even
                            more aggravated, for the cession of this territory to the Somali
                            Republic would provoke similar claims against Kenya from Ethiopia and
                            would inevitably result in increased pressure by the Somalis on Ethiopia
                            for the Ogaden as well as a stepped-up campaign against the French in
                            Djibouti.</p>
                        <p>While the French had not informed the British as to their intention
                            regarding French Somaliland, it would seem to be the last vestige of
                            French colonialism in Africa, with obvious consequences. But if the
                            French should pull out, it would create extremely serious problems for
                            the Ethiopians and so the British were inclined to hope that the French
                            would hold fast. Governor Williams agreed it was a problem area and
                            remarked that we also had received little information from the French on
                            their intentions.</p>
                        <p>Sir Roger then turned to the problem of economic and military assistance.
                            The main principle all of the Western parties involved should follow was
                            one of balancing the assistance given Somalia and Ethiopia.
                            Unfortunately, the British had found it extremely difficult to work with
                            the Ethiopians and had very few projects in that country. However, they
                            were expecting a fairly large private participation by the firm of
                            Michael Cotts in a Gezira-like scheme in the Awash Valley. The United
                            States, of course, was meeting Ethiopian requirements quite successfully
                            as well as providing for the military. On the other hand, the British
                            were giving very significant amounts of assistance to Somalia and were
                            now also undertaking the training of the Somali Army in conjunction with
                            the Italians. The United States should be aware that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could not continue to provide assistance
                            to Somalia at the present level. The Treasury had informed the Foreign
                            Office that the most that could be hoped for next year was #1.3 million.
                            Since it was expected that military expenses would increase from
                            #150,000 to #250,000 there obviously would have to be considerable
                            decrease in the amount of money available for developmental activities
                            in the North. Perhaps it might be useful, Sir Roger said, if the United
                            States could obtain a better balance in the assistance it was providing
                            the two countries and thus somewhat compensate for this reduction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW3">Witman</persName> corrected the
                            misapprehension of the British regarding the theoretically
                            disproportionate amount of assistance being furnished by the United
                            States to Ethiopia. He pointed out that if military aid were
                            excluded—which should be the case since it was primarily a quid pro quo
                            for Kagnew Station—the economic assistance on a per capita basis was
                            very much in Somalia's favor. Furthermore, in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1962 Somalia was one of the few countries where we were
                            increasing our assistance. We would actually be providing more economic
                            assistance to Somalia than to Ethiopia this year. Mr. Gordon explained
                            that the total contemplated <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0462"/>for
                            Somalia in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 was approximately $9
                            million with $5.6 million of this amount going to the Chisimaio Port.
                            When Sir Roger asked how the remaining roughly $4 million was to be
                            spent, Mr. Gordon explained that specific amounts had not yet been
                            decided upon, but the United States planned to concentrate on two or
                            three sectors of the Somali economy—the inter-river area, education and
                            water resources, plus the public safety program—and the various projects
                            in these sectors would probably total $3.2 or $3.4 million.</p>
                        <p>Sir Roger remarked that this was very interesting information and
                            confirmed his views that tripartite discussions among the British,
                            Italians and United States should be held in the near future. The
                            British had recently talked with the Italians in Rome, where they had
                            found the Italians questioning the United States contributions to
                            developmental aid. The Italians had said that they did not know what the
                            United States had done to fulfill its commitments made during the Rome
                            talks in November 1960 with the exception of Chisimaio Port. In view of
                            this lack of communication it would probably be useful for the three
                            powers to review what they had done and what they contemplated doing in
                            1963.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> said he agreed
                            that such a tripartite meeting would probably be useful. He felt that a
                            balanced approach as proposed by Sir Roger was generally right. However,
                            it should be noted that although the United States seemed to be
                            providing a considerably larger amount to Somalia, this was not a
                            deliberate policy on our part. It resulted from our wanting to provide
                            one large project the Somalis particularly desired. Since this had been
                            Chisimaio, the picture had been thrown somewhat out of focus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW3">Witman</persName> then said we hoped both
                            the British and Italians would come forward soon with the military items
                            they proposed to provide in the forthcoming year. The Somalis seemed
                            very concerned over that particular subject. Sir Roger said that they
                            had that problem very much in mind and did intend to inform the Somali
                            Government shortly. He gathered from what had been said that the United
                            States would not object to a tripartite meeting which he envisioned
                            primarily as a discussion of what could be done in the developmental
                            field since the United States obviously was not prepared to participate
                            in budgetary support and military assistance. The Italians and British,
                            of course, would use the occasion to inform the United States of their
                            intentions in these areas. Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> said that inasmuch as the British had talked to
                            both the Italians and us about the meeting, he would suggest they
                            consider themselves delegated to coordinate the arrangements for it.
                            When Sir Roger asked if the United States preferred any particular site,
                            the Governor said he thought it would be better to hold it outside of
                            Washington. Sir Roger agreed and said he would probably propose to the
                            Italians that a preliminary discussion take place among our Ambassadors
                            in Mogadiscio <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>which would be
                            followed up in Rome in the Spring in formal tripartite
                            consultations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gordon said he would like to point out that any reduction by the
                            British in their aid level would create quite a problem for us with
                            Congress. It was extremely difficult to make a convincing case of why we
                            had to pick up additional aid requirements when former metropoles
                            reduced their contributions. Sir Roger said he realized this, but, if it
                            would be of any help, it could be pointed out that the British reduction
                            would probably occur entirely in its former protectorate as far as the
                            developmental sector went. If the British in addition had to reduce the
                            amount of budg-etary support they were providing, this would not effect
                            the American aid level since we are not participating in the budgetary
                            sector.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WW3">Witman</persName> inquired whether the
                            British were aware of the activity surrounding the new <persName
                                corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile Selassie</persName> I University.
                            Specifically, were they going to send a representative to the Founder's
                            Day celebration on December 18, 1961? Sir Roger replied that while they
                            were aware of some new stirring within the University, they had not been
                            invited as far as he knew to send a representative to the convocation
                            and had made no preparation to do so.</p>

                        <p>Scope and purpose US-<gloss target="#t_IEG1">IEG</gloss> military program
                            decided in 1953 agreement as modified 1956 and 1960. Since that time
                            efficient, modern Ethiopian fighting force has been developed capable
                            defeating any potential invader. In fact, nowhere near Ethiopia's
                            borders does there appear to exist a well-armed adversary capable of
                            launching a serious sustained attack on Ethiopia. The possibility of
                            successful aggression against Ethiopia has therefore, if anything,
                            markedly decreased. The military case for expansion Ethiopian forces for
                            defensive purposes is thus difficult to substantiate at this time and
                            justification to numerous interested observers would be necessary not
                            only by Ethiopia but also by U.S. in view Somalia's recent complaint to
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss><gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            and increasing concern over Ethiopian military might. <gloss

                            taking any action which might trigger an arms race in Horn of Africa.
                            While Italy and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> undoubtedly would not
                            provide Somalia with any more military equipment than required for
                            internal security and basic defense, there is little doubt Communist
                            countries would exploit any possibility of causing an armed conflict
                            between Somalia and Ethiopia. Furthermore, and important as a separate
                            consideration, support for additional military equipment and forces at
                            this time would place considerable additional strain on Ethiopia's
                            resources and quite probably necessitate postponement of some important
                            economic development measures. Therefore in the interest of peace, and

                            particularly since it is understood that governments of Italy and <gloss

                        <p>After the usual opening pleasantries, the President referred to United
                            States interest in Somalia and limitations on United States aid <pb
                                n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0468"/>arising from the balance of
                            payments position. He stressed the large and continuing drain which had
                            resulted from our aid program over the years. The President underlined
                            the importance of continued aid from Italy and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The Somali Ambassador expressed his gratitude for United States aid to
                            date and requested the President to urge the Italians to continue their
                            aid and to pay the amounts promised for budgetary support. In reply the
                            President promised we would urge the Italians to take appropriate
                            action. He remarked that Italy's gold and balance of payments position
                            made this quite feasible, particularly, since Italy was doing nothing
                            elsewhere of this kind in the field of direct aid. It was noted that the
                            United States was not in a position to provide budgetary support.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Ambassador referred to the Soviet offer to
                            finance certain items which are included in the United States plans for
                            the second phase of Chisimaio. He said that the Somali Government would
                            turn down the Soviet offer. However, they would wish the second phase to
                            be financed by United States grants, not loans. The President stated it
                            was unwise to mix Soviet assistance with ours. The Congress does not
                            like this.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised the question of United States military aid to
                            Ethiopia. In reply the President noted (a) our aid was for internal
                            security purposes; (b) it began in 1952, long before Somalia's
                            independ-ence; (c) we counted on the Italians and British to provide aid
                            in this field to Somalia.</p>
                        <p>In closing the meeting the President said that the United States would
                            address itself again to Italy requesting it to provide aid to
                            Somalia.</p>

                        <p>Somali Prime Minister Abdirascid's visit may prove a delicate one. He's
                            after more US aid and our support against Ethiopia; on neither account
                            are we in a position to satisfy him fully, though we're trying to be as
                            forthcoming as we can.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>Somalia's whole outlook is dominated by its fear of Ethiopia (it has an
                            undemarcated border with Ethiopia's Somali-populated Ogaden province),
                            and its ambitions for a greater Somalia—including Ogaden, part of Kenya
                            and French Somaliland.</p>
                        <p>Though Somalia's inclinations are pro-Western, it regards the US as so
                            committed to Ethiopia that it has tended to reinsure with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the Bloc (this in turn feeds
                            Ethiopian fears). The Soviets have been quite responsive, to the tune of
                            $57 million in credits. Both the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are training Somali military
                            and technicians.</p>
                        <p>Because of our Ethiopian ties, we've tried to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Italy, as the former landlords, to
                            shoulder the main burden of supporting this desperately impoverished
                            little country (see Tab V-B).<note n="1" xml:id="d283fn1">Not attached
                                to the source text.</note> But we've also invested quite a bit,
                            especially in the Chisimaio port.</p>
                        <p>Abdirascid will no doubt complain about our military aid to Ethiopia
                            (primarily as rent for the Kagnew communications facility we've given
                            about $10 million <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> annually to build
                            up the largest—and most useless—force in East Africa). Here again we've
                            relied on the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Italy to help
                            Somalia, but their aid, always small, is declining. If we don't start a
                            small <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program ourselves Somalia will
                            turn increasingly to the all too willing Soviets and <gloss
                                target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A few hundred thousand a year in preclusive <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> for Somalia (we already support the police) will be
                            much cheaper than the Ethiopian bill if Somalia goes to the Bloc and
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>. So if Abdirascid presses, we
                            urge you tell him we'll examine his needs. <persName corresp="#p_HSI1"
                                >Haile Selassie</persName> will holler, but we propose to make the
                            same points to him.</p>
                        <p>Even more important, I hope you'll impress on Abdirascid the dangers
                            Somalia is running if it pursues an irredentist course. It faces two
                            broad choices, either to compose its quarrel with Ethiopia and take the
                            road of internal development or to engage in an arms race in which we'll
                            inevitably be on the other side. We don't see how Somalia can win out
                            over Ethiopia; on the other hand, it could well use the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> route to mediate its boundary dispute (we
                            don't want to mediate this one because the prospects for success are
                            poor).</p>
                        <p>Abdirascid also wants more economic aid. We've already given more than to
                            most comparable African states (average of $2.5 million <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957-61, $14.2 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 and $8.8 scheduled for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963). The biggest item has been $7.3 in
                            development grants for the Chisimaio port; we're committed to a $3
                            million second phase but there's an argument over whether it should be
                            loan or grant. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> rightly insists that
                            all other such African capital projects are going on a loan basis and
                            that our <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> terms are hardly onerous
                            (3/4%, ten years grace, 40 years to pay). But <pb n="448"
                                xml:id="pg_448" facs="0476"/>Abdirascid contends that we promised a
                            grant. The history is sufficiently fuzzy that you may want to concede if
                            he presses the issue.</p>
                        <p>We've been more than forthcoming enough with Somalia to justify lecturing
                            our visitor gently about the dangers of walking both sides of the
                            street. Guinea's experience alone suggests that the Bloc eventually
                            demands payment for its aid in one form or another.</p>
                        <p>The visit will be a success if we can send this fellow away thinking that
                            (1) we'll help defend him against Ethiopia if he'll only stop tweaking
                            Selassie's nose; and (2) the West will be reasonably helpful on aid if
                            he doesn't play too much to the Bloc.</p>

                            <item>Before Abdirascid's departure, State tried to remove one recent
                                irritant in US-Somali relations by promising three DC-3's for an
                                internal Somali airline on condition that the Somalis arrange for
                                effective management and agree not to accept Soviet aid for the
                                line. We had promised these planes a year ago but withdrew the offer
                                when we thought erroneously that the Somalis were negotiating for
                                Soviet management. Abdirascid was annoyed by the withdrawal and is
                                not fully satisfied with our conditions for renewing the offer. If
                                he raises this, you may want to soft-pedal the conditions by
                                describing them as simply a normal effort to insure effective use of
                                our aid and to assure Congress that it will not be mixed with Soviet
                                aid.</item>

                            <item>Abdirascid also let his hair down on the US aid program. He feels
                                our procedures are too slow, conditions too restrictive, and that we
                                often fail to consult the Somalis. <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                    >AID</gloss> rejoins that the chief difficulties are poor Somali
                                planning and lack of coordination within the Somali government. If
                                Abdirascid brings up this issue, why not agree that improved
                                US-Somali cooperation is essential but deliver a little lecture on
                                the need for sound planning and self-help. Our projects take time
                                because we, unlike the Soviets, are more interested in making a
                                well-planned economic contribution than a political splash.</item>

                                State doesn't know what he wants to say. Since his English is only
                                fair, State will have an Italian-speaking interpreter (our visitor's
                                Italian is fluent). We have no good Somali speaker available, so
                                will have to depend on their interpreter if they choose
                                Somali.</item>

                        <p>The President welcomed the Prime Minister and asked his judgment on
                            events in East Africa, as well as how he felt relations between Somalia
                            and the United States could be improved.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Abdirascid thanked the President for the opportunity of
                            expressing views on problems of interest to both countries, which he
                            would do with the President's indulgence in a frank and direct manner.
                            He asked that it first be established, however, that the Somalis were
                            grateful for American interest and support both before and after
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that Somalia could not solve its
                            problems by itself; it needed the help of the developed countries,
                            especially the United States as a world leader. Somalia's problems were
                            political, economic and social. Political independence was not enough if
                            the country did not advance with economic development, especially for
                            such a backward country as Somalia.</p>
                        <p>Abdirascid then gave an historical account of the “artificial and unjust”
                            division of Somali lands during the last century into five parts by
                            Italy, Great Britain (2 parts), France and Ethiopia. The greatest hope
                            of <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>the Somali people was for
                            reunification, but the Somali Constitution condemns all manifestations
                            of violence. He felt there was a necessity for good offices or mediation
                            by friendly states, and hoped the U.S. could be helpful. Ethiopia toward
                            the end of the last century had incorporated a large part of Somali
                            territory, and was using troops against the Somali population. These
                            troops were equipped with arms furnished by the United States. He said
                            he had told the U.S. Embassy the U.S. should stop the moral and material
                            aid it was providing Ethiopia against the defenseless Somali people. The
                            Government knew what the U.S. explanation was, but it was very difficult
                            to explain to the man-in-the-street that the U.S. was furnishing arms to
                            Ethiopia. The Prime Minister appealed to the President as the highest
                            authority in the United States to stop furnishing arms to Ethiopia. He
                            added that Ethiopia was also encouraging the Kenyans not to come to
                            terms with Somalia over the Northern Frontier District. In the interest
                            of avoiding a new Congo situation, he hoped the U.S. would intervene
                            with Kenya before independence to transfer the Somali-inhabited area to
                            Somalia.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> replied that the
                            problem of arms for Ethiopia was a difficult one. We had had similar
                            situations elsewhere as in the Pakistan-India dispute over Kashmir. We
                            would attempt to prevent the use of our equipment against the other. We
                            recognized that as long as Ethiopia possessed the important territory
                            Somalia claimed, relations between the two countries would be
                            complicated. Our assistance to Ethiopia was begun long before Somalia
                            became independent, and was not related to Somalia in any way. We would
                            like to see relations with Ethiopia improved but were not sure what the
                            U.S. could do. The Kashmir dispute had gone on for 14 years, but we were
                            not able to influence it. Nor the Pak-Afghan, Thai-Cambodian,
                            Ecuador-Peru, even Cuba-U.S. disputes. There was tremendous popular
                            feeling, and we were not able to settle them as we would have liked to
                            see them settled. Perhaps the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could
                            help. But it was beyond the resources of a single country like the U.S.
                            to solve all problems, especially those going back in time. We could
                            only try to minimize differences, and try to keep a balance. The
                            President noted that we were providing relatively large economic
                            assistance for Somalia in addition to the obligations of the Italians
                            and British which they should fulfill. We were anxious to see the
                            problems between Somalia and Ethiopia settled, and would do anything we
                            could.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Abdirascid remarked that he understood U.S. difficulties
                            over good offices. Somalia was anxiously awaiting arms, but was not
                            asking for arms just because Ethiopia was getting arms.</p>
                        <p>The President responded he would like to talk to the Prime Minister about
                            how we might assist Somalia in this area. (Abdirascid did not take the
                            President up on this point.) The President then went on to cite the use
                            by the Portuguese in Angola and the French in Algeria of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arms, <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452"
                                facs="0480"/>and said he understood Somali irritation, but assured
                            the Prime Minister we would attempt to prevent the wrong use of the arms
                            we were giving Ethiopia. He reiterated that we would be glad to talk to
                            see if we could be of any assistance to Somalia. (Again Abdirascid
                            seemed not to grasp the meaning of the President's remark.) The
                            President added that the Ethiopians alleged Somalia was getting arms
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> and the Soviets. The Prime
                            Minister vigorously asserted that Somalia was getting absolutely no arms
                            from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> summarized this

                        <p>I understand <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Coffin took
                            care of most remaining specifics this morning, so your second talk with
                            Abdirascid can be short. However, one problem area deserves a
                            reprise.</p>
                        <p>Nothing you can say will be of more benefit to US policy than urging
                            Abdirascid to lay off Somali-Ethiopian disputes. Unless the trend is
                            reversed, things are heading toward an eventual clash in which we will
                            end up backing Ethiopia and the <gloss target="#t_UAR1"
                                >UAR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> the Somalis.</p>
                        <p>There is no point in debating the specifics. We understand Somali's
                            ethnic claims. But the overriding fact is that Ethiopia is so much
                            bigger than Somali that Somalis can't win. You could drive this home by
                            warning Abdirascid that if the issue is pressed to a confrontation, we
                            may be forced to take the Ethiop side, something we don't want to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand we oppose any Ethiopian pressures on Somali. In fact we
                            will consider limited military aid along with <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and Italy (this <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0481"
                            />point apparently didn't sink in at last session) in addition to our
                            support of Somali police. But we think it folly for so desperately poor

                            is a mistake made by all too many underdeveloped states.</p>
                        <p>Also worth saying is that we can protect the Somalis even more by

                            serious about self-help.</p>

                        <p>Abdirascid expressed gratitude for US interest and support and expressed
                            need for help. Then followed exposition Somali desire for reunification
                            and expression concern over difficulties with Ethiopia and US military

                        <p>President explained problem US arms for Ethiopia was difficult one
                            similar to those faced by US in certain other areas in which we endeavor
                            prevent use of US equipment by one nation against another. Recognizing
                            complications in Ethiopian-Somali relations and long history US
                            assist-ance to Ethiopia unrelated to Somalia, US could only try minimize
                            differences and keep balance. President noted large US economic

                                >UK</gloss> obligations and expressed desire see problems between
                            Somalia and Ethiopia settled. US would do what it could.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister mentioned Somali need for arms. President said he would be
                            prepared see how US could be of assistance. Secretary separately
                            enunciated further US agreement in principle study Somalia's genuine
                            security needs and to consider supplementing efforts other Western
                            powers. Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with changed US position
                            and expressed hope for vehicles and equipment and training for both Army
                            and police. He agreed with suggestion security forces could play useful
                            role in economic development as well as security field. He stressed
                            Somalia's needs were strictly for internal security and defense and
                            promised any assistance provided would not be used for offensive
                            purposes. Prime Minister also stressed fact Somali Government committed
                            by Constitution to pursue its national goals only by strictly legal and
                            peaceful means.</p>
                        <p>President presented case for long-term low interest loan on second phase
                            Chisimaio with ten-year grace period. Somalis did not press for grant.
                            Prime Minister outlined points dissatisfaction with aid program
                            including slowness execution projects and high administrative costs.
                            Details various aid problems were later reviewed in separate meeting

                        <p>US opposition to commingling was stressed. Prime Minister said Somalia
                            constitutionally neutral but fundamentally pro-Western and would not go
                            to Soviet Union for essential needs if they could be obtained in
                            West.</p>

                        <p>President concluded that visit useful in focussing attention on Somali
                            needs. Somalis must recognize difficulties US has in meeting Somali
                            needs, but assured Prime Minister US anxious do best it can and is very
                            sympathetic to Somalia's difficulties.</p>

                                        aid, but added that Western aid to Somalia was perhaps the
                                        lesser of two evils because Ethiopia could count on U.S.

                            Somalis promised not to use it for aggression. Somalis agreed that we

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THGJ1">Torbert</persName> mentioned our
                            offer to Abdirascid early this month. The Somalis last week agreed to
                            our sending a survey team by mid-March. We have in mind very limited

                        <p>Attached is a fuller rundown on how we're trying to damp down
                            Somali-Kenya-Ethiopia tension.<note n="1" xml:id="d292fn1"><ref
                                    target="#d291">Document 291</ref>.</note> We've already invested
                            considerable effort, but must be careful because of our larger interests
                            in Ethiopia and <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"/>Kenya. Also,
                            the Somalis have painted themselves into a corner by breaking relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, despite our best efforts.
                            This will cost them $3.4 million in <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            aid. Kenyan leaders have hardened against ceding any of their
                            Somali-inhabited territory.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> ineptness has added to this mess. The
                            British have long encouraged the Somalis to think the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would give them Somali Kenya before
                            granting Kenyan independence. But Sandys, in negotiating the Kenyan
                            constitution and paving the way for self-government there in May,
                            reversed field and triggered off the Somalis.</p>
                        <p>We're in the middle. The Somalis will ask us to fill the aid gap, but
                            we're already hard-pressed to justify the $10.7 million we're giving
                            this year. We don't want to oppose Kenya, and most other Africans back
                            Kenyans. But Kenyan refusal to cede Somali region will provoke further
                            Somali agitation and invite Bloc meddling.</p>
                        <p>Moscow may go slow to avoid alienating Ethiopia and Bantu Africa.
                            However, the Soviets have increased their effort in Somalia in the past
                            year and may be willing to pay the price for a toehold on the Gulf of
                            Aden. As for the Somalis, Abdirascid wants to avoid Bloc aid, but his
                            opposition is pressing for it.</p>
                        <p>Immediate job is to keep the Somalis from further violence. We'll use our
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> survey team (held up until
                            current flurry ends) to maintain our influence. State recommends we get
                                <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> to propose 90-day
                            cooling-off period leading to Somali-Kenyan talks.</p>
                        <p>What happens in Kenya in the next year will be the key to ultimate
                            solution. If Kenyan leaders foresee so much trouble controlling the
                            Somalis that they decide to allow increasing autonomy, there might be a
                            way (cession, purchase, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plebiscite) to
                            transfer Somali region to the Somali Republic. But this sets a bad
                            precedent in rest of Africa, and Ethiops would violently oppose. So best
                            line may be to dampen Somali irredentist hopes and convince Somalis
                            their best bet is cooperation in some sort of East African
                            federation.</p>

                                to take such action since Somalia had just reaffirmed its
                                territorial claims against Ethiopia, Kenya, and French Somaliland.
                                Western emphasis on establishing only a modest defense force in
                                Somalia was meaningless if such a force were used for guerrilla
                                warfare. In addition, the Emperor asked how the West could believe
                                that Western aid, if it was in fact so small, would stop Somalia
                                from obtaining more aid from the East. (Telegram 27 from Addis

                        <p>I saw Mohamed Awale Liban, Chef de Cabinet to Somali President Aden, on
                            11 July 1963, following his talks with Ken Hansen and Dick Donahue.</p>
                        <p>I expressed our concern that Somalia is “isolating” iteself from its
                            neighbors. Though professing our strong friendship and desire to help
                            Somalia, I pointed out that there was very little non-Africans could do
                            to help the Somalis if they persisted in pushing Greater Somalia to the
                            point where they alienated all the surrounding countries. I'm not sure
                            he got the point, but I suggested the Somalis should realize that the
                            cards are stacked against them and that it would be in their interest to
                            come to some peaceful terms with their more powerful neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Liban, after blaming the current <gloss target="#t_NFD1">NFD</gloss>
                            tension on the British, said he hoped the US could help with some sort
                            of arbitration since we are friendly with the Kenyans, the British, and
                            the Ethiopians. I reiterated that the primary obstacle was one we
                            couldn't do much about—the problems and aspirations of Kenyan leaders.
                            Somali and Kenyan rather than US actions would determine outcome of this
                            issue. It had become an “African” issue not a colonial one.</p>
                        <p>Somalis would find same problem if they turned to Soviets, Chicoms or
                                <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> for backing. These powers would
                            probably be no more willing than we and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, in last analysis, to provide arms or back Somali claims
                            to point of alienating many other bigger and more powerful African
                            states.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries about our respect for the Somali
                            president, we left it that he understands our difficulty over backing
                            Somalia against our other African friends, and our desire to help within
                            our limitations. Liban is obviously a thoughtful and moderate fellow,
                            but he is naturally a heartfelt spokesman for the Somalis whom he feels
                            history has greatly wronged.</p>

                                Development</hi></p>
                        <p>The President asked the impression of His Highness on the prospects for
                            the future of Ethiopia. His Highness replied that Ethiopia has a chance
                            for a grand future, provided it receives help. Ethiopia is tied down by
                            her economic needs and her inability to obtain finance for development.
                            She is less fortunate than some other African countries in that she has
                            not had the benefit of direct assistance during a colonial period.
                            Ethiopia would welcome an increase in the size of the Peace Corps and
                            they wish to explore the possibility of forming their own peace corps
                            type organization. (<hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: this point was
                            discussed in some detail earlier when His Highness talked with Mr.
                            Shriver.) They are also engaged in the exploration for minerals.</p>
                        <p>Ethiopia has a five-year development program, but at least one-half of
                            the program must be based on outside financial aid.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Ethiopian-Somali Dispute</hi></p>
                        <p>The President introduced the subject of the prospects for settling the
                            dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia. His Highness remarked that it
                            would be easier for Somalia to answer this question as they initiated
                            the dispute. There is no way to settle the matter until Somalia changes
                            its present inflexible “Greater Somalia” policy. The demands of Somalia
                            cannot be met by Ethiopia. To accede to the Somali position would set a
                            dangerous precedent in Africa as there are many countries which could
                            have boundary disputes based on ethnic considerations. “Where would the
                            mapping of Africa end if Somali claims are honored?” Ethiopia views
                            arming Somalia as the arming of an aggressor. Ethiopia has no aggressive
                            intent toward Somalia, there being no economic attraction. Ethiopia has
                            no claims on Somalia and wants to pursue a policy of peaceful
                            co-existence.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed concern at the direction Somalia might take and
                            inquired where Somalia might go for arms.</p>
                        <p>His Highness stated that the Somalis are fanatical on the question of
                            “Greater Somalia”. It would not surprise Ethiopia if Somalia turned east
                            for arms and support. There is nothing the Somalis would not do in
                            pursuing their aims. The world can't afford to see a breach of peace
                            which might lead to World War III. Somalia should be firmly told that
                            her aims will not succeed. The idea of a “Greater Somalia” was
                            originally started by certain foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired if the reference was to the British, and received
                            an affirmative reply. The President stated that the U.S. has no evidence
                            that the British now hold these views. The President noted <pb n="469"
                                xml:id="pg_469" facs="0497"/>Somalia's strategic location and
                            expressed the hope that a peaceful settlement of Somalia's disputes with
                            Ethiopia and Kenya will be worked out.</p>
                        <p>His Highness asserted that there is little hope for settlement unless the
                            Somalis change their view. Ethiopia has gone as far as possible in
                            offering co-existence, including a plan whereby the various nomadic
                            tribes would be free to use Ethiopian territory, but Somalia
                            refused.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Portuguese African Territories and
                                South Africa</hi></p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the President concerning the situation in
                            the Portuguese areas of Africa and in South Africa, His Highness
                            described as “painful” Ethiopia's decision to break relations with
                            Portugal. Ethiopia has a long history of friendly relations with
                            Portugal and offered to act as mediator in the present dispute. Her plan
                            would have called for a continued Portuguese presence, but a gradual
                            turning of control to the Africans with eventual independence. This was
                            rejected by Portugal, so a break in relations between Ethiopia and
                            Portugal was necessary. The situation looks very dangerous and it
                            appears that unless Portugal modifies its positions there will be
                            bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>Concerning South Africa, His Highness felt that there is apparently no
                            hope at all. The South African government appears inflexible and this
                            may lead to disastrous consequences. It is a more difficult situation
                            than with Portugal.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered if success in South Rhodesia might help the
                            situation in South Africa, to which the response was “this is
                            dubious.”</p>

                            <item>Britain, Somalia, and the new African government of Kenya are
                                currently seeking a modus vivendi on the Somali-inhabited portion of
                                Kenya's Northern Frontier District. The United States, representing
                                British interests in Somalia, is acting as an intermediary in the
                                steps leading to talks between the parties, but has not taken a
                                stand regarding the substance of the issue.</item>

                            <item>The Ogaden is internationally recognized as being within the
                                boundaries of Ethiopia, but is largely inhabited by Somali tribes,
                                closely related to the peoples of the adjacent Somali Republic. It
                                is one of the five parts of Greater Somalia (the other two
                                unredeemed being: French Somaliland and the Northern Frontier
                                District of Kenya) which the Somali Republic aspires, by its
                                constitution, to bring under the sovereignty of the Somali Republic.
                                It is a plateau area, for centuries the grazing place of nomadic
                                tribes. These tribes, of Somali origin, wander across the
                                international frontiers. One area in the north of the Ogaden
                                Province, the Haud, contains water and livestock forage used by
                                tribes on both sides of the line.</item>

                            <item>The problem of the Ogaden has, therefore, three elements: Somali
                                irredentism, Ethiopian insecurity, and the traditional movement of
                                nomadic tribes.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Somali irredentism toward the Ogaden has been pursued at various
                                times in the past by press and radio propaganda and by seeking
                                support in international meetings (e.g. Afro-Asian People's
                                Solidarity Conferences) for resolutions in favor of unification of
                                all Somali inhabited areas. The Somalis were undoubtedly given some
                                hope and stimulus immediately following World War II when the
                                British administered all of the five Somali lands except French
                                Somaliland, and proposed a Greater Somaliland Trusteeship under
                                    <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> administration. The Somalis
                                were led to believe, at a minimum, that Britain might hold the
                                Ogaden for ultimate incorporation in an independent Somalia. The
                                exact degree of Somali Government stimulation of unrest within the
                                Ogaden is frequently difficult to determine because of the inherent
                                sympathy of the Somali tribes for the Somali Republic and their
                                antipathy for Amharas, because of the more or less free traffic back
                                and forth across the frontier, because of the normal tribesman's
                                penchant for carrying a rifle, because of traditional illicit arms
                                traffic through the area, and the fact that sizeable quantities of
                                arms were acquired by tribesmen during World War II, and because of
                                the Ethiopian tendency to assume that all unrest in the Ogaden is
                                ultimately traceable to the Somali Republic. The Somali Republic,
                                while having the reunion of all parts of Greater Somalia as its
                                ultimate aim, has been careful to pursue this objective “by peaceful
                                and legal means” as the Somali Constitution requires, and its
                                leaders have frequently stressed their intention to adhere to this
                                requirement.</item>

                            <item>Ethiopian insecurity is compounded of the fact that, historically,
                                Somaliland has been an invasion route into Ethiopia, of the inherent
                                Christian Ethiopian fear of being engulfed by Moslem expansion, and
                                of the keen apprehension that the Somali Republic, perhaps with the
                                assist-ance of the United Arab Republic, can, by subversion in the
                                Ogaden, succeed in rendering the Ogaden unmanageable, if not
                                detaching it. Basically, many leading Ethiopians undoubtedly see in
                                the existence of a Somali Republic, as weak as it may be, a latent
                                threat to the security of the Ethiopian Empire. Many Ethiopians
                                undoubtedly see the elimination of an independent Somalia as the
                                ultimate solution of the Ogaden problem.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The intractability of the problem cannot be overemphasized. The
                                Ethiopian apprehension is very deep, going back to the sixteenth
                                century when Somali tribes almost destroyed the Empire and, of
                                course, to the Italian invasion in 1935, when an incident in the
                                Ogaden became a casus belli. It is difficult, indeed, to see any
                                real detente between the two peoples. It appears possible, however,
                                to work for some form of modus vivendi which will lessen the
                                continuing possibilities of serious trouble between them.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The United States is vitally interested in this problem
                                essentially because of its important interests in Ethiopia. Any
                                United States policy which would clearly alienate the Emperor of
                                Ethiopia would seriously affect these interests. Similarly, any
                                unrest affecting the security of the area or permitting the
                                establishment of greater influence by either the Soviet Union or the
                                Chinese Communists would also threaten these interests. It has,
                                therefore, been the conclusion of the United States that, while not
                                alienating the Emperor, we should seek to retain a broader influence
                                in the Horn than our influence in Ethiopia, itself.</item>

                            <item>The United States cannot take any action which would appear to
                                lend support to Somali irredentism. The United States supports the
                                validity of current frontiers in Africa, despite the many claims and
                                counter-claims which surround them and believes changes should come
                                about only with the consent of all parties involved. The United
                                States should continue to make this clear to the Somali
                                Republic.</item>

                            <item>At the same time, it does not seem feasible, in a search for a
                                formula which would stabilize the area, to seek to obtain a formal
                                renunciation of Somali claims on Ethiopia. There is strong emotional
                                and constitutional support in Somalia for these claims and it is
                                doubtful any political leader could successfully make such a
                                renunciation. Alternative formulae must, therefore, be found.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Essentially, the Ethiopian position is to leave Somalia weak and
                                to isolate it as much as possible from other African relationships.
                                Ethiopia feels that it can, with its military power, guarantee that
                                unfriendly influences will not establish themselves in Somalia. At
                                least one high-ranking Ethiopian has stated that Ethiopia would
                                prefer to see arms <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0500"/>coming
                                into Somalia from the Sino-Soviet Bloc or the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss> because Ethiopia might then get
                                wide support to eliminate the threat and, in the same action,
                                establish Ethiopian suzerainty over Somalia. The Ethiopians feel
                                that, because of Soviet and Chinese desires for influence elsewhere
                                in Africa, they will not undertake support for Somali irredentism to
                                a point that would genuinely threaten Ethiopia.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>The United States cannot accept fully the Ethiopian position in
                                this matter. The United States supports the integrity of independent
                                nations in Africa except where there are changes in status brought
                                about by peaceful means. We cannot appear to support the Ethiopian
                                reluctance to accept fully the continued independence of Somalia.
                                While it may well be true that neither the Soviets nor the Chinese
                                would give support to Somali irredentism, it is also true that they
                                have already shown a willingness and capability to establish
                                positions of influence in Somalia which represent a threat to
                                Western interests in the area, if not to Ethiopia.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>Ideally, the United States would prefer that the alleviation of
                                tensions in this area could be accomplished by direct talks between
                                the two parties or by the intervention of an international agency.
                                Unfortunately, direct talks appear possible only with the stimulus
                                and diplomacy of a third party. The United Nations had a major role
                                in the creation of Somalia and in some of the readjustments of
                                frontiers after independence. Ethiopia, however, is not enthusiastic
                                about bringing in the United Nations because of its reluctance to
                                “internationalize” the Ogaden problem. The machinery of the
                                Organization of African States is a possibility, but this machinery
                                is not yet established. No other individual nation appears at the
                                moment to have the influence in both capitals possessed by the
                                United States.</item>

                                toward establishing a peaceful modus vivendi between Ethiopia and
                                Somalia which will set aside conflicting claims and result in a
                                measure of actual accord which might result, in turn, in a reduction
                                of the current emphasis of both on the building of military

                            with respect to Ethiopian requests for military and economic assistance
                            were still under discussion and that a supplemental memorandum would
                            advise you of the decisions. Decisions have now been reached and will
                            presumably be conveyed to the Ethiopian advance party by Defense and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> prior to the arrival of the
                            Emperor.</p>
                        <p>In reaching these decisions, full consideration has been given to the
                            significance of Ethiopia on the African scene and to our own special
                            interests in the present Kagnew communications stations and future
                            space-probe installations at this site. The positions we have taken
                            represent in dollar commitments only a fraction of the total initial
                            Ethiopian <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0503"/>requests. The final
                            Ethiopian military assistance requests, scaled down from an original
                            $60,000,000 represented $20,000,000. Our reply commits us immediately to
                            approximately $2,000,000 over a five to six year period although the
                            prospect of more expensive aircraft looms in the distance (probably 1968
                            and beyond). Out of economic requests estimated at between $50 and $70
                            million, no commitments have yet been made and the immediate prospect is
                            only for a commitment of approximately $200,000 in Bailey bridges and
                            experts, with the possibility in the future of a loan for the
                            Finchaasdam, subject to the completion of surveys and availability of
                            funds.</p>
                        <p>Our replies will undoubtedly be below the Emperor's expectations,
                            although, given the prospect that he will avoid either a discussion of
                            details or bargaining, we may not know his true reaction. He feels we
                            have a commitment to support him in the military field and he places
                            prime importance on aid for Ethiopia's economic development. To be
                            certain of his acceptance of these replies, we must convince him that
                            (a) we have a keen desire to assist Ethiopia; (b) we had a very short
                            time (one week) to examine the requests; (c) the laws governing our aid
                            program require that we have the fullest possible supporting data before
                            committing ourselves to a project; and (d) we are currently experiencing
                            special difficulties with foreign aid appropriations.</p>

                        <p>In a preliminary session with the Emperor (with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KEM3">Korry</persName> and Dr. Menassie Haile present),
                            the President brought up the question of Somalia with the Emperor and
                            asked for his views. The Emperor, citing that he had said all of this to
                            the Ambassador previously on several occasions, repeated familiar
                            arguments that arms assistance to Somalia encouraged Somali irredentism,
                            had caused bloodshed and unrest within Ethiopia, had been particularly
                            harmful because of its timing, and had not precluded communist
                            assistance. On this last point, he stated that the Somalis had received
                            nine million sterling in assistance from Peking. The Ambassador
                            interjected that there was no military assist-ance. The Emperor rather
                            disdainfully asked what else would it be for.</p>
                        <p>The President in his reply made these points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The U.S. arms program was very small and provided over three
                                    million dollars of assistance over a period of five to six
                                    years;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It was mostly designed for civic action;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The objectives of this policy were exactly the same as
                                    Ethiopian objectives, which was to encourage the moderates in
                                    Somalia and to keep peace and stability in the Horn of Africa;
                                    and</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>If either the Chinese or the Soviets gave military assistance
                                    in significant amounts, the U.S. Government would be forced to
                                    review its policy of arms to Somalia.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In the course of the discussion, the Emperor said that a modus vivendi
                            was necessary between Somalia and Ethiopia and the U.S. must support
                            this. The President agreed. The Emperor also acknowledged that there was
                            no conflict between U.S. and Ethiopian objectives. The President said
                            that in the United States view, Ethiopia was the key country in that
                            part of the world and that it was with that in mind that we made our
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>In the full session, the Emperor again expressed concern over United
                            States military assistance to Somalia. The President reiterated the
                            United States reasons for this action, stating that only time will tell
                            whether these reasons are valid. The United States, he said, was aware
                            of the Somali mission to the U.S.S.R. and the possibility that Somalia
                            might receive some assistance from China. Assistance from these quarters
                            could produce more instability. The United States has made no deliveries
                            to Somalia. It will continue to watch the situation closely and will
                            keep in touch with the Emperor on developments.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor said that he wished to make it plain that he did not feel
                            that the United States should give no assistance to Somalia. He was
                            preoccupied with the kind of arms assistance which would encourage <pb
                                n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>Somalia to provoke Ethiopia.
                            Arms from Somalia have already been used in the eastern part of
                            Ethiopia. The Emperor knows of the United States interest in friendly
                            relations between Ethiopia and Somalia and is prepared to work to that
                            end. If the Somalis are stimulated through military assistance, however,
                            the situation could get out of hand.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in the United States view by responding with some
                            assistance, it is possible to increase influence and promote stability.
                            The United States has had some harsh experiences when it has rejected
                            requests for assistance in such situations. He reiterated that it was
                            necessary to wait and see what developed.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor said that another aspect of his fears was that with the
                            Somali election coming up, Somalis were out-doing one another in
                            attacking Ethiopia. The opposition in Somalia has accused the Government
                            in the Ogaden and the Ethiopians have been forced to retaliate against
                            the tribes.</p>
                        <p>The President said there would be a better view of the situation when
                            information was received on the Somali mission to Moscow. He promised to
                            keep in close touch with the Emperor.</p>

                        <p>On October 16, 1963, the Somali Government presented an aide-memoire to
                            the U.S. Embassy in Mogadiscio stating that when it had previously
                            complained to the U.S. Government regarding large-scale U.S. military
                            aid to Ethiopia, it had received assurances that the United States would
                            not permit its military aid to Ethiopia to be used for aggressive
                            purposes. It noted that the Somali Government had every reason to
                            believe that these weapons were primarily intended by the Ethiopian
                            Government for use against the Somalis under its domination or against
                            the Somali Republic itself, and declared that experience had shown that
                            Ethiopia had no compunction about using these modern weapons against
                            defenseless men, women, and children, as the massacres committed since
                            1960 had shown. Thus, the Somali Government was justified in placing
                            responsibility for Ethiopian aggression on the United States, since its
                            military aid had permitted Ethiopia to carry out its policies of
                            repression and aggression; and it asked the U.S. Government to
                            reconsider its policy of providing large-scale military aid to Ethiopia.
                            (Airgram A-192 from Mogadiscio, October 16; Department of State, Central
                            Files, DEF 19-3 US-ETH)</p>
                        <p>On October 18, the U.S. Government responded that the program of U.S.
                            military assistance to Ethiopia had begun long before the Somali
                            Republic became an independent country and thus could not be construed
                            as being directed against Somalia. It pointed out that the agreement
                            between the United States and Ethiopia stated that the Ethiopian
                            Government would use this assistance exclusively to maintain internal
                            security and legitimate self-defense, and that it would not undertake
                            any act of aggression against any other nation. (Telegram 238 to

                        <p>Points listed by western reps could include: (a) observation that western
                            military aid program is largely grant whereas Soviet policy is usually
                            insist on cash or credit terms; (b) disastrous effect of Soviet arms on
                            Somali budgetary and financial situation. Western powers ask how <gloss
                                target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> can meet payments to <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as well as provide substantial
                            support costs needed to implement Soviet program; (c) despite <gloss
                                target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss>'s proclamations of neutrality,
                            acceptance Soviet arms offer will inevitably lead in minds African and
                            western states to strong identification Somalia with Soviet policies and
                            objectives; (d) western powers recognize that on various and frequent
                            occasions, <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> has reiterated its
                            intention pursue national <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0511"
                            />policy goals only by peaceful and legal means. If <gloss
                                target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> accepts Soviet arms, however, Ethiopia
                            and Kenya will almost automatically conclude that such arms would be
                            available for use in Ogaden or <gloss target="#t_NFD1">NFD</gloss>. On
                            other hand, if <gloss target="#t_GSR1">GSR</gloss> receiving military
                            aid only from western sources, Ethiopia and Kenya would retain some
                            degree of confidence that no encouragement being given by aid suppliers
                            to using of arms in irregular actions. Moreover, fact that west is
                            source of supply would reduce temptation engage in preventive action
                            against Somalia.</p>

                            <p>“The President was also given a brief sketch of the territorial
                                claims situation. He asked whether we could stay in the military
                                picture in some way, possibly in the training area, even though the
                                Soviet program went ahead. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THGJ1"
                                    >Torbert</persName> said that he understood the consensus was
                                that we could not enter a training program at the same time that the
                                Soviet program was starting and indeed the Somalis probably would
                                not want it; however, it seemed advisable that we should maintain
                                careful watch on the situation and be prepared to enter the military
                                training field on short notice if an opportunity presented itself in
                                the medium term future. The President indicated agreement with this
                                idea.</p>
                            <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THGJ1">Torbert</persName> said he
                                felt the next year or so would be a difficult time because the
                                Somali Government would be seeking to justify its turning to the
                                Soviet Government for aid and might therefore make anti-western
                                statements which might tempt us to an indignant retort or a gesture
                                of cancelling our other programs. It seemed, however, highly
                                desirable, at least for the next year or so, to maintain our
                                non-military programs in Somalia in order to keep all the influence
                                we have in key sectors of the Somali Government and economy. He
                                hoped therefore that any contrary pressures in the United States
                                could be kept under control. The President indicated full
                                understanding of this idea and general agreement with it.”</p>

                            but also from the nature of US governmental operations. Thus far the <pb

                            programs affecting Ethiopia have different and not always mutually
                            consistent missions. Our immediate and short-term goals do not seem at
                            first glance entirely consistent with our longer-term objectives. Some
                            are essentially positive and progressive in character, looking forward
                            to considerable change, while others appear negative, preclusive, or in
                            support of the status quo. The risk is always present that the pursuit
                            of longer-term policies relating to reform could unleash forces which
                            could jeopardize immediate US interests. A balance of objectives is
                            needed, therefore, in the interest of a continuing US influence in

                        <p>Political power relationships in Ethiopia still operate within a
                            feudal-type framework. Loyalty to person, family, and clan are far more
                            significant than are institutional ties to the State. The vast majority
                            of Ethiopia's people, an aggregate of disparate ethnic groups, of
                            several different faiths, is still treated by the dominant Christian
                            Amhara minority like conquered subjects. In this fragmented society,
                            respect for military power is a major cohesive ingredient.</p>
                        <p>The present political structure, with the Emperor at its apex, is
                            supported by four main groups. These include two traditional—the
                            aristocracy and the clergy—and two more modern (in both of which the
                            aristocracy is prominent), the armed forces and the government
                            bureaucracy. A discontented younger educated elite is seeking greater
                            power and influence, but within the present system rather than through
                            its abolition.</p>
                        <p>It appears that this system still has a good deal of resilience,
                            political and economic, and should continue at least for the next few
                            years with no great change if <persName corresp="#p_HSI1">Haile
                                Selassie</persName> remains in control. It will probably continue,
                            with certain adjustments primarily within the Amhara oligarchy, if his
                            death occurs within the same short time-span. While there has been
                            incipient plotting against the Government (and there may be new attempts
                            to overthrow the Emperor), thus far these efforts have been disorganized
                            and the dissidents are mindful of the need to retain the present <pb
                                n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0517"/>system. Barring the
                            unpredictable “sergeant's revolt” or assassin's bullet, we do not
                            anticipate a radical and thoroughly revolutionary movement emerging
                            unless the Emperor (1) remains on the throne beyond the next five or six
                            years, (2) makes further reforms which are only window-dressing, and (3)
                            leaves behind him the threat of a prolonged struggle over the
                            succession. The longer this period lasts, however, the more important it
                            will be that the system show valid evidence of constructive development
                            which is uncertain without US pressure.</p>
                        <p>If this estimate is correct, we have more flexibility than would
                            otherwise be apparent both in US policy formulation and timing. Thus we
                            do not face the bald choices of supporting either those in power or
                            those who will probably succeed them. Since those young modernists
                            desiring change are still seeking it through enlarging and modernizing
                            the present system, we should be able to work for the enhancement of
                            their position without necessarily jeopardizing our relations with the
                            governing authorities or upsetting the system. Furthermore, the crucial
                            period in which we have to operate against a major threat to the
                            internal political structure is not just the next few weeks or months
                            but a range of several years. Within this longer interim we see the
                            possibility of dynamic forces in the military and educated elite coming
                            forward. Under the conditions posited above, they would either take over
                            control or support a system which is more progressive but which still
                            rests basically on the ethnic supremacy of the Amhara minority. Our own
                            progress in this interim period could influence the direction in which
                            these forces move and reinforce the social cement needed to build a
                            stronger Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>During this breathing spell, we must make every effort to maintain and
                            improve the climate for Kagnew and to find some means of dampening or
                            extinguishing the unfriendly fires on both sides of the
                            Ethiopian-Somalian border. If we meet these objectives with
                            straightforward and timely action, the strategic influence of the US in
                            the Horn of Africa should be assured for the predictable future.</p>

                        <p>Conversation with Issa at Nairobi touched on general subject US military
                            aid to other countries, with Somali Foreign Minister observing that
                            there had been examples of concurrent US and Soviet military aid to the
                            same country. I replied that where this had happened there had been
                            other overriding considerations which did not exist at present moment in
                            relation to Somalia. However we did not have closed mind on this
                            subject, and future developments might turn out in such a way as to
                            warrant a re-examination of our attitudes. Nevertheless, for the
                            present, mixed military aid was out in view size Soviet arms program,
                            which was largest granted to any single African country, and because of
                            our apprehensions, repeatedly voiced to Somali leaders, that arms
                            program such magnitude would deflect Somalia's meagre resources from
                            priority needs of Somali people and result progressive weakening of
                            economic situation.</p>

                        <p>The seeds of another Algeria have been sown in Southern Africa. Blacks
                            face Whites across a sea of developing hate. With this confrontation and
                            the increasing polarization of racial relations the White supremacists
                            are seeking to strengthen their established positions.</p>
                        <p>The white peoples of these territories—the Republic of South Africa, the
                            Portuguese African possessions of Angola and Mozambique and the Central
                            African Federation (the Rhodesias and Nyasaland)—are taking up a
                            defensive position along a rampart from which they feel there is no
                            retreat. They appear to be developing bonds of mutual fear in the face
                            of advancing Black African nationalism and their governments are
                            contemplating a mutual defense strategy, if not economic and political
                            union as well. Theirs is, in effect, a last white stronghold against
                            black invasion from the north and racialist-inspired upheavals from
                            within.</p>
                        <p>From the north pressing against these white communities comes the tide of
                            nationalism. In this area, 26 newly independent states, mainly black,
                            have found their freedom since the end of World War II. More new black
                            nations will add to these pressures this year and next.</p>
                        <p>The possible collision of these rival forces in a world already full of
                            racial hatreds is highly dangerous. A Black-White confrontation on the
                            southern tip of Africa, particularly in an area where U.S. investments
                            are extensive, and U.S. nationals are numerous, is perilous in terms of
                            U.S. objectives in Africa as a whole.</p>

                        <p>There are even more cogent reasons than these which must give us
                            concern—notably the likelihood of the Cold War being introduced into
                            Africa on the wings of racial bias; the weakening of our own
                            relationships with Africa which would ensure [<hi rend="italic"
                                >ensue</hi>?]; the weakening of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>; and the domestic dilemma with which the U.S. would be
                            confronted in event of such tragedy.</p>
                        <p>It should be the policy of the United States to mitigate the polarization
                            of the races into two warring factions. Unfortunately, this polarization
                            has already proceeded a long way, and our efforts must now be directed
                            toward preventing it from developing so completely that strife cannot be
                            averted. Unless this aim is accomplished, we may be faced with a major
                            racial war, the consequences of which could even mean that masses of
                            white inhabitants will be driven out of Africa. We have not yet made a
                            full assessment of the military potential of the Redoubt group. South
                            Africa could no doubt supply her own military needs but probably would
                            have difficulty in meeting all the needs of her partners.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult if not impossible accurately to estimate the pace of
                            events. The problems of Angola are upon us today. The Rhodesian problems
                            (at least those of Southern Rhodesia) are developing so swiftly they may
                            be with us full force within the next year. The problems of South Africa
                            are only slightly more long range. In all areas time is running out.</p>

                        <p>The following principal points emerged from the discussion with the
                            President on US strategy in the United Nations at the 17th General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of other subjects.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">5. Colonial Questions</hi></p>
                        <p>The President agrees we should oppose sanctions as a way for the Assembly
                            to deal with Portuguese colonial policy and the South African questions.
                            He also agrees we should attempt to get the Soviets off the Committee of
                            17 on the assumption that we would also do the same. The Secretary
                            reported we had made no progress in our negotiations with the Portuguese
                            on the Azores base and that they have linked this question with the
                            United States position in the United Nations on colonial questions. The
                            Secretary said we want to make a strong effort to get the Azores base
                            negotiations completed before the General Assembly gets involved in a
                            number of the Portuguese colonial questions. The President agreed we
                            should see how far we can get with the Portuguese on this matter,
                            although he was not disposed to make concessions on the colonial issues
                            if the Portuguese were not going to make any movement towards moderation
                            and were going to use the base negotiations as a means of exerting
                            pressure on us.</p>

                        <p>Focus of attention was Southern Africa. British agreed with US assessment
                            of importance of area and of necessity of showing progress there in
                            order not to lose gains of decolonization to the north.</p>
                        <p>With respect South Africa, it was agreed that US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassadors should consult together and
                            make recommendations as to possibilities of persuasion and pressure on
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> to weaken apartheid. Re UNGA
                            apartheid resolution, we commented that <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> perhaps less concerned about public posture vis-à-vis
                            the Afro-Asians than the US. Stevens said this not the case but <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was inhibited by problem of High
                            Commission territories.</p>
                        <p>Re Southwest Africa possibility of joint or parallel approach to <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> making clear that US and <gloss

                                >SAG</gloss> in event of unfavorable <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> decision was discussed. Maud strongly favored such
                            approach but Stevens indicated Foreign Office wished to consider
                            further. We expressed view such approach could be useful.</p>
                        <p>Re High Commission territories British would welcome a greater American
                            interest and specifically designation of FSO to cover these
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>Re Federation we emphasized key importance in general Southern African
                            context. British agreed and did not dissent when we expressed view that
                            after Southern Rhodesian elections <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            would feel free to exercise influence in Federation and particularly
                            Southern Rhodesia. We explained tentative US thinking re provision of
                            training assistance in public administration and related fields to
                            African nationalists in Southern Rhodesia and pointed out that this
                            designed inter alia to achieve immediate effect of providing
                            constructive activity for some <gloss target="#t_ZAPU1">ZAPU</gloss>
                            restrictees when released. British reaction was not enthusiastic. They
                            stressed rather the need to improve secondary education facilities with
                            a view to increasing African capabilities over the long run. While not
                            objecting to discussion of US idea with Whitehead, they stressed need
                            for caution. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreed that Whitehead had
                            not closed door to possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss><gloss
                                target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> good offices and apparently do not rule

                                >UN</gloss> role after elections.</p>
                        <p>One interesting sidelight on Federation discussion was that <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> dis-sented from US view that African
                            governments in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia would wish to be assured
                            of early African government in Southern Rhodesia if there were to be
                            continuation of some form of association. <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> held two northern governments would be willing deal with
                            white government in Southern Rhodesia and that issue was really not one
                            of color. The real problem is existence of Federation in present form
                            which stands in way of accommodation among three members.</p>
                        <p>Re Portuguese territories there was general agreement on estimate of
                            situation. British somewhat pessimistic about prospects rapporteur
                            proposal in UNGA. We asked them to suggest individuals who might <pb
                                n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0523"/>serve as rapporteur. British
                            agreed that we both should urge other <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> allies to make known to Portuguese their concern over
                            Portuguese policy in Africa.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>The southern quarter of the African continent has become the last major
                            area of the world in which white minorities still control territories
                            where they are far outnumbered by colored populations. While there is an
                            outside chance of a peaceful transition from white dominance to
                            multiracial democracy, it is more probable that over the next few years
                            southern Africa will see a great intensification of hostility between
                            whites and blacks.</p>
                        <p>This probable development will embarrass the West throughout the
                            Afro-Asian world and could compromise the global U.S. strategy of
                            fostering a cooperative community of free nations across the North-South
                            dividing lines of race and wealth. This in turn would enhance

                        <p>These consequences would be the more certain and the more serious should
                            the white governments of Southern Rhodesia, Portugal and South Africa
                            pool their political, economic and military assets in a common front
                            against black Africa. To prevent such a coalescence and to ease as far
                            as possible the black-white confrontation, the U.S. should as a general
                            strategy chip away at Southern Rhodesia, South-West Africa and the
                            Portuguese territories rather than make a frontal assault on the hard
                            rock of South African apartheid.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> to the President.</p>
                        <p>The basic problem is what position we should take in the meeting of the
                            Security Council late in July when the African states, following the
                            Addis Ababa meeting, plan to force the issue on the Portuguese colonies
                                <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>and on South Africa. Their
                            basic policy is to try to make us choose between Portugal and South
                            Africa, on the one hand, and the rest of Africa, on the other. We wish
                            to evade that choice. We are opposed to sanctions against Portugal and
                            South Africa, to their expulsion from the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, etc. On the other hand, we recognize that the African
                            states have history on their side and probably justice too; and that,
                            unless we want to abandon Africa altogether, we will have to do
                            something to show our support of the principle of self-determination.
                            The question is how far we can go without risking the Azores base and
                            various tracking stations, etc., made available to us in South
                            Africa—or, even more essentially whether these military facilities are
                            so indispensable to us that they must determine our African policy. The
                            choice may well be between the military risk of losing the Azores and
                            the South African tracking stations and the political risk of losing
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>As you will see from the attached documents, the Secretary and Johnson
                            are fearful of pushing Portugal and South Africa too hard, while
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> would like to go at least
                            as far as some form of arms embargo.</p>
                        <p>It is not an easy question. My own feeling is that <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> should make a much more rigorous
                            examination than it seems yet to have made of the alternatives to the
                            Azores and the tracking stations. We should also know much more than we
                            seem to know at present about the prospects of the Salazar regime; I
                            doubt if even this regime can hold out forever against the winds of
                            change. I think it would be a great mistake to base our African policy
                            on the indispensability of the military facilities and the permanence of
                            the Salazar regime if neither of these things turns out to be so.</p>
                        <p>In any case, I hope you will be interested.</p>

                                strategy. The armed forces of independent nations in that area are
                                scarcely able to maintain internal order. There is, however, a need
                                to deny the area to the Sino-Soviet Bloc because of the natural
                                resources and the flanking geographical position of Africa in
                                relation to Europe, the Middle East, and South America.
                                Consequently, the United States must be prepared for contingency

                                between Moslem Arab North Africa and Negro Sub-Saharan Africa. There
                                are indications that the Addis Ababa Conference and the <gloss

                                Africans. Thus, any US position which favored Portugal or the
                                Republic of South Africa would undoubtedly have greater impact on

                        <p>In view of the President's interest in this matter, I suggest you fill
                            him in on the developments recounted below. A full reporting cable is
                            expected from Geneva Thursday morning.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Economic and Social Council has had before it
                            resolutions calling for the expulsion of Portugal and South Africa from
                            the Economic Commission for Africa (<gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                            >ECA</gloss>). Today <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> voted to
                            expel Portugal by a vote of 7-0-11 (U.S., U.K., France). Final action
                            regarding South Africa has been postponed to sometime early next
                            week.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Expulsion of Portugal</hi></p>
                        <p>The principal reason why we were not able to prevent Portugal's expulsion
                            is that it refused to accept associate membership in <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, as have the U.K., France and Spain. We
                            were ready to be helpful in this regard and submit and campaign for a
                            resolution providing associate membership for Portugal as an alternative
                            to expulsion. The Portuguese turned down our suggestion that they accept
                            such status.</p>
                        <p>We abstained on the expulsion resolution, along with the British and the
                            French and others. We explained this vote in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss>, to the Portuguese, and to the press on grounds
                            that: (a) the decision was really made last year by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> that its membership should consist only
                            of African countries; (b) that the U.K., France and Spain have accepted
                            associate membership, which we believe is the appropriate status for
                            Portugal; and (c) that to vote against the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> recommendation for expelling Portugal would be an
                            anomaly since it would imply we believe Portugal, a European metropole,
                            should be a full member and have a status greater than the U.K., France
                            and Spain which accepted associate membership. In short, since Portugal
                            insisted on full membership, the proposition on which we wanted to
                            vote—for Portugal to become an associate member—was not available to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>In order to minimize any adverse repercussions we have explained the
                            above several times to the Portuguese, the latest being about noon <pb
                                n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0532"/>today. The Portuguese, of
                            course, will remain unconvinced that we could not have prevented its
                            expulsion by voting “no” on the resolution. Last night they informed us
                            there were seven sure votes against expulsion and asked us to reconsider
                            our abstention. This appears to be part of a deliberate campaign by the
                            Portuguese to misrepresent the voting alignment and how individual
                            delegates would vote, including our own. We nevertheless took the
                            prudent step of once again checking the vote count this morning. Our
                            delegation reported telephonically, after a meeting of the Western
                            caucus, that the vote count was 7 in favor of expulsion, 0 against, and
                            11 abstentions. This is exactly how the vote came out.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Expulsion of South Africa</hi></p>
                        <p>The situation regarding possible expulsion of South Africa is much more
                            complicated.</p>
                        <p>As a device to prevent adoption of an expulsion resolution, South Africa,
                            in contrast to the Portuguese, heeded our advice and informed <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> that it has voluntarily decided
                            not to participate in the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>. We were
                            therefore in a position to support a resolution which would have the
                            effect of making South Africa a temporary non-participant in <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> in lieu of a resolution calling for its
                            outright expulsion. The non-participation resolution failed of adoption
                            6 in favor (U.S.), 6 against (Soviet bloc plus Africans) and 6
                            abstentions (U.K., France, Australia and Latin America). The Communists
                            and some of the Africans voted against because they favor expulsion,
                            whereas some of our close allies abstained because they felt it was too
                            strong. The expulsion resolution has not yet been voted upon. In this
                            confused parliamentary situation, Ambassador Bingham successfully got a
                            postponement of further voting for a few days.</p>
                        <p>While we wish to make our decision based on a full report from Geneva, we
                            believe our likely next step will be to submit a slightly changed
                            resolution embracing the non-participation formula and to work on the
                            Latins, Australia and the U.K. to support this proposition in order to
                            prevent adoption of the expulsion resolution. We believe there is better
                            than an even chance of succeeding in this tactic.</p>

                        <p>The South African issue will probably be up in the Security Council again
                            in the next couple of weeks and <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> will be here this week to prepare with State a
                            recommendation for a US position for the President's approval. The
                            Portuguese-African issue will remain at low temperatures so long as the
                            talks don't break down. Within State several new proposals are being
                            argued involving expanded student programs and covert assistance for
                            South African and Portuguese-African refugees. I think we need some
                            basic reconsideration and clarification of policy at this point.</p>
                        <p>There are no early or easy solutions in prospect in Portuguese Africa or
                            in South Africa. It will take a long process of political, economic and
                            possibly military attrition before the Portuguese accept the necessity
                            for serious negotiation; South Africa will be even tougher.</p>
                        <p>The United States has interests on both sides of these issues so
                            substantial that we can't afford to “choose sides.” Nor do we have
                            sufficient leverage to compel the antagonists to come to terms. In the
                            past several years, accordingly, we have sailed an improvised, often
                            erratic course between the antagonists, with a series of minor
                            concessions to the Africans as the pressures mounted, while avoiding an
                            irreparable break with the Portuguese or South Africans.</p>
                        <p>While this has been the most sensible—indeed the only sensible—course
                            open to us, we are beginning to run out of sailing room. I think we can
                            gain some space for maneuver, and continue to defer the dilemma, if we
                            raise our present tactic to a deliberate, systematic policy.</p>
                        <p>Here are some things we can do or, in some cases, just do better, to
                            improve our position. They are based on the proposition that since we
                            can't now bet on a winner, we should be hedging our bets and buying
                            time.</p>

                                The key fact is that we are reaching a point where no further
                                concessions can be made to the Africans. We are going to have to
                                take positions which will be more pleasing to the Portuguese and
                                South Africans and less so to the Black Africans, as we did on the
                                Portuguese African resolution in the Security Council in August and
                                on the Southern Rhodesian resolutions since then. Plimpton has
                                already proposed as <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>much in

                                the South Africans. Thus our position in New York will become more
                                difficult, and we will have to seek offsetting gains with the
                                Africans outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. However, we
                                can at least limit our damage in New York if, for negotiating with
                                the Africans, our Mission has clearer guidance on our strategy and
                                purposes. Our performance in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                has been weakened by lack of firm instructions for the Mission
                                itself, which has had conflicting feelings on the African
                                issues.</item>

                        <p>The President said he was delighted to meet Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName>, a distinguished African leader
                            whose role he knew would increase in importance. He said America took a
                            great interest in African affairs, and visits such as Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName>'s gave us the opportunity to
                            increase our knowledge of the state of affairs in the various countries.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> said he greatly
                            appreciated the President's interest and support. He then oulined
                            briefly the historical background of the formation of the Federation,
                            pointing out that the Rhodesian settlers at that time (1953) hoped that
                            it would prevent states like Nyasaland from moving towards eventual
                            independence. It was for this very reason that Nyasaland and Northern
                            Rhodesia wished to break up the Federation, though, once independent,
                            they might move back into a voluntary association of their own.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> said that Iain MacLeod,
                            the Colonial Secretary, was a very close friend of his and that the
                            Colonial Office was working hard to bring early self-government to
                            Nyasaland. Following elections in July the Africans would have a
                            majority in the Legislative Council and then would work out with the
                            British the next steps towards independence.</p>
                        <p>The President changed the subject to the Congo, and asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> his estimate of the situation
                            there. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> said that all
                            friends of the Congo should work to bring Gizenga and Kasavubu together,
                            that both of them were true nationalists and put the good of the country
                            above selfish interests. By contrast, he said, Tshombe was a “Quisling”
                            who thought only of his own interests, and that everyone in Africa knew
                            he was a stooge of Belgian and other mining interests in Katanga. He had
                            no <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>standing as an African
                            leader. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> observed that
                            he thought the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role was essential in
                            the Congo. The President said he was glad to hear this as he thought the
                            smaller and newer countries must look to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> for protection in such circumstances. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> and the President agreed the big
                            powers conflict must be kept out of such situations and the <gloss

                            situations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> mentioned his long
                            friendship and association with <persName corresp="#p_NK2">Kwame
                                Nkrumah</persName> of Ghana, and the President said he had had a
                            most useful conversation with President <persName corresp="#p_NK2"
                                >Nkrumah</persName> on his recent visit to Washington. In response
                            to a question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> said he
                            thought <persName corresp="#p_TAS1">Sekou Toure</persName> of Guinea was
                            too much of a nationalist and “African individualist” ever to be “put in
                            the pocket” of the East. The President said it was his observation that
                            none of the new African states wanted to be in anyone's pocket.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> if
                            he would take a minute to be introduced to the members of his Cabinet,
                            who were meeting next door. On concluding the call, the President
                            assured Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> that he could
                            count on his continuing personal interest in developments in Nyasaland
                            and that we recognized his country's needs for assistance in education
                            and other fields. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> said
                            that next time he came he would bring a “shopping list” with him.</p>

                                    the Ministry that the Consulate General has been instructed to
                                    make the following reply:</p>
                                <p>The United States has long favored the peaceful evolution of
                                    dependent areas to full independence on a democratic basis. The
                                    views of the United States Government on self-determination are
                                    a matter of public record. The statements made by Mr. <persName

                                            >Williams</persName> had said that he thought the U.S.
                                        people and Government were firmly committed to the idea of
                                        self-determination and that he was quite confident that they
                                        were going to back the African people in their aspiration
                                        for self-determination. (Telegram 843 from Lagos, March 9;
                                        ibid., 611.45C/3-961)</note> were a positive reaffirmation
                                    that the United States Government has an abiding attachment to
                                    the consistent application of the principle of
                                    self-determination for all peoples. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>' remarks should not be
                                    construed as indicating in any way the view that independent
                                    states in Africa are subject to what is termed ‘neo-colonialism'
                                    or ‘neo-imperialism.'</p>
                                <p>It is natural that officials of the United States should, from
                                    time to time, make statements concerning the basic principles to
                                    which the United States is committed, e.g., orderly progress
                                    toward democratic self-government. It is not believed, however,
                                    that an expression of general principle should be interpreted as
                                    having the direct, specific local application which the
                                    Ministry's note apparently imputes to one such general statement
                                    made by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the Ministry's question regarding the policy of
                                    the United States toward the Federal Government, it is the firm
                                    belief of the United States Government that the problems of any
                                    country, including the question of the pace of progress toward
                                    democratic self-government, are best resolved by the peoples and
                                    governments concerned. In countries where the population
                                    consists of various ethnic groups, it is the hope of the United
                                    States that political, social and economic progress will occur
                                    without reference to the race of individual citizens.”</p>

                                6. (Ibid., 745C.02/3-662)</note> Department believes that
                            constitutional proposals for Northern Rhodesia, as modified by Colonial
                            Secretary Maudling's announcement on February 28, offer best basis
                            possible under existing circumstances for peaceful political
                            development. While proposals do not guarantee an African majority in the
                            legislature, they appear to make such majority possible if the African
                            parties make a determined and honest effort to participate in the
                            elections. Although both Kaunda and <persName corresp="#p_WSR1"
                                >Welensky</persName> have called the proposals unworkable, neither
                            seems eager or prepared to oppose implementation. We <pb n="514"
                                xml:id="pg_514" facs="0542"/>regard this as favorable development.
                            At present any alternative to these proposals would be opposed by one
                            side or the other and lead to extra-legal means to safeguard or advance
                            the interests of the aggrieved party. Continued indecision in <gloss
                                target="#t_NR1">NR</gloss> would postpone and complicate efforts to
                            establish stable, representative government in the territory and would
                            make the solution of problems at the federal level increasingly
                            difficult. Possibility of strikes, violence, and use of federal troops
                            would be increased. Unrest could also induce Southern Rhodesian
                            authorities to strengthen security measures and postpone further racial
                            advancements. Department favors orderly, peaceful political evolution
                            toward representative government in all territories of the Federation
                            and believes <gloss target="#t_NR1">NR</gloss> constitutional proposals
                            permit such evolution, perhaps not at pace desired by Kaunda but still
                            with unmistakable forward motion. There is no question that all
                            pressures are in direction early establishment African majority in
                                <gloss target="#t_NR1">NR</gloss> and US hopes Kaunda aware this
                            fact and can exercise necessary statesmanship and patience called for at
                            this critical juncture.</p>
                        <p>Department pleased that Pletcher has already made overtures to Kaunda in

                        <p>The complex racial-political situation in the Federation of Rhodesia and
                            Nyasaland is producing strains which could lead to violence and
                            bloodshed if not promptly remedied. The objective of the British
                            Government, which still has ultimate responsibility for the three
                            territories of the Federation, is to bring about rapidly the advancement
                            of the African population and their full political participation in
                            government. The British have declared that there is no future for the
                            Federation if it cannot secure the support of the African majority. The
                            United States supports British objectives while encouraging greater
                            speed in transferring responsibility to the Africans. In Nyasaland the
                            Africans in the Legislative Council already have a majority and, under
                            the leadership of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Hastings
                                Banda</persName>, have achieved a wide measure of self-government.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName> is determined to take
                            Nyasaland out of the Federation though he may be able to continue some
                            economic association.</p>
                        <p>In the protectorate of Northern Rhodesia the British Government has been
                            under extreme pressure from African Nationalists on one side <pb n="517"
                                xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>and the white settlers on the other
                            over the preparation of a new constitution. After a year and a half of
                            controversy both sides have reluctantly agreed to a constitution which
                            calls for elections in October that may result in a slim African
                            majority. Kenneth Kaunda, leader of the United Independence Party
                                (<gloss target="#t_UNIP1">UNIP</gloss>), does not consider the new
                            constitution workable but his party will fully contest the election,
                            nevertheless. Sir <persName corresp="#p_WSR1">Roy Welensky</persName>,
                            Federation Prime Minister, has denounced the constitution which he sees
                            as a threat to Federation.</p>
                        <p>Kaunda has recently told us that his real fear is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName> will use force or other
                            unconstitutional methods to prevent the Northern Rhodesian elections and
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will not come to the defense
                            of the protectorate. We are confident, however, that the British will
                            make every effort short of the use of troops, in their power to prevent
                            any such rash act by <persName corresp="#p_WSR1"
                            >Welensky</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In Southern Rhodesia, which has by far the largest number of white
                            settlers and which has been virtually self-governing since 1923, the
                            Africans have never been allowed to participate in the government.
                            However, the new constitution worked out in London calls for elections
                            this Fall in which Africans may fill 15 seats of a total of 65 in the
                            Southern Rhodesian legislature. The largest African national party,
                            Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (<gloss target="#t_ZAPU1">ZAPU</gloss>),
                            under the leadership of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NJ2">Joshua
                                Nkomo</persName> has recently appealed to the United Nations Special
                            Committee of Seventeen for help in securing democratic rights for
                            Southern Rhodesia. The fear of the Africans is that further political
                            evolution in Southern Rhodesia will be frozen once the new constitution
                            goes into effect, unless the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> retains
                            and exercises control over the political destiny of the colony. While
                            the British dispute this, we are inclined to agree with the Africans
                            that the possibility is real. The United States therefore hopes that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will continue to exercise its
                            influence in Southern Rhodesia, aimed at increasing African
                            participation in government. It appears to us that the potential for
                            real trouble is greater in Southern Rhodesia than in any other part of
                            the Federation. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WE4"
                                >Whitehead</persName> has pressed actively and successfully for
                            removal of racial discrimination and for educational and political
                            advancement at all levels in Southern Rhodesia. In doing so, he may have
                            pushed the white settler electorate about as fast and as far as is
                            politically possible. There is a real danger that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_WE4">Whitehead</persName> takes a too-liberal line, he
                            may be overthrown and a reactionary white group could come to power
                            which could lead to an Algerian type racial stand-off or conflict.</p>
                        <p>The United States recognizes and supports the efforts of the British
                            Government to resolve the complex problems of the Federation by
                            maintaining the present direction and the trend of African advancement
                            in the territories of the Federation, recognizing the difficulties, the
                            hazards, and the injustices which will occur along the way. We also
                            maintain and <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>develop close and
                            friendly contact with the African leadership that will head the Central
                            African states of tomorrow. The attention which the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Committee of Seventeen is now focusing on
                            this area could, we hope, have a helpful effect, both in convincing the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Federation authorities that
                            it's later than they think, and in allaying the fears of Africans that
                            their plight is forgotten.</p>
                        <p>At the same time current consideration in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Committee could have a damaging effect. A number of its
                            members including the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are pushing
                            for the adoption of resolutions which would call on the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to abrogate the 1961 constitution for
                            Southern Rhodesia and recommend early independence for both Rhodesias.
                            The United States Delegation is opposing the adoption of any resolution.
                            We fear in particular that passage of an immoderate text would make the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> task of conciliation more
                            difficult, might make Welensky even more extreme, and might reduce the
                            willingness of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to cooperate with
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>

                            after the elections in March 1963. It was <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> policy to push forward with a broad educational program
                            with the hope that it might be possible for the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> to get rid of Southern Rhodesia in five years or so.
                            This was very much the desire of Her Majesty's Government. After the
                            elections Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WE4">Whitehead</persName>
                            would undertake some forward-looking projects relating to the
                            enfranchisement of the population. Nothing should be done to make
                                <persName corresp="#p_WE4">Whitehead</persName>'s task more
                            difficult, particularly at this time, since the only alternative to

                            Rhodesia has given us a better insight into your difficulties there. We
                            fully appreciate the prime importance of Sir <persName corresp="#p_WE4"

                            compound your difficulties by offering advice from the sidelines.</p>
                        <p>We do, however, have a common problem facing us almost immediately in the

                            question of Southern Rhodesia will be considered next week. We, of
                            course, want to support you to the extent that this support can be
                            effective and consistent with our own necessities. I understand

                                presented the British with very serious difficulties, since granting

                            nation within a year to a year and a half. Although it is now a British
                            protectorate and one of the three constituent territories of the
                            semi-autonomous Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the groundwork has
                            been laid for rapid constitutional advance this year. On November 23,
                            1962, the British Government announced agreement to grant
                            self-government to Nyasaland early in 1963. On December 19, 1962, the
                            British Government announced acceptance of the principle of the
                            secession of Nyasaland from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

                            Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda is expected to become Prime Minister and that
                            simultaneously most, if not all, of the forms of self-government are to
                            be introduced into the territory. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1"
                                >Banda</persName> has told our Resident Consul that secession would
                            be accomplished during the summer of 1963 and that he had no desire to
                            delay the attainment of full independence from the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The problems of Nyasaland are great and will continue for decades. Most
                            of the population engages in subsistence agriculture; schools and
                            hospitals are few; the population of nearly three million is relatively
                            dense and steadily growing. Nevertheless, the new African political
                            leadership, headed by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName>,
                            has resolutely tackled the problems and appears to enjoy the
                            overwhelming and enthusiastic support of the people.</p>
                        <p>United States operations in Nyasaland are moving forward in accompaniment
                            with the constitutional advance. We are planning to raise the level and
                            capacity of our consular representation in the territory while
                            continuing our modest, but effective, information program. Our <gloss

                            now entering the implementation stage. Obligations in <gloss

                            obligations in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 and <gloss

                            approximately the same level. Finally, the arrival on January 15 of

                            a result of our operations and partly as a result of the influence of
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BHK1">Banda</persName>, the United States

                        <p>Field does not believe Africans would be interested in politics if they
                            were spared influence of politician-agitators. He reminded us he gets on

                        <p>To meet the demands of Messrs. Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula, who
                            control the Northern Rhodesian coalition government, Mr. R. A. Butler,
                            as Minister for Central African Affairs, announced in London on March 29
                            that any member of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland had the
                            right to secede from the Federation. As all three territorial
                            governments are now in the hands of parties opposed to the continuance
                            of the Federation and as Nyasaland's right to secede had been conceded
                            in December, this was the actual death knell of the Federation. The
                            British hoped by this decision to clear the atmosphere for talks in June
                            aimed at finding some alternative form of association acceptable to all

                        <p>This development was followed on April 1 by a demand from the Prime
                            Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston J. Field, that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> now state in principle that Southern
                            Rhodesia has the right to achieve independence at a date no later than
                            the secession of either of the other two territories from the Federation
                            or the granting of independence to the other two territories. He set

                            as a pre-condition for Southern Rhodesia's participation in any talks
                            regarding the future of the Central African territories. The British
                            cabinet held an emergency meeting on April 1 and had subsequent
                            discussions on this problem. To date, however, it has not made known its
                            decision.</p>

                            Rhodesian independence at this time. If independence is not granted,
                            however, there is a possibility that the Southern Rhodesian Government
                            may decide to declare independence unilaterally. Sir Roger Stevens has
                            told officers of our Embassy in London that a unilateral declaration of
                            independence by Southern Rhodesia could be prevented only by force and
                            that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> would find it impossible to use

                                >Nkomo</persName>'s appeal seems unlikely to be successful and it is

                        <p>The British share essentially the same objectives as the United States in
                            Southern Rhodesia. From a narrow national interest point of view they
                            would probably prefer to get out as quickly as possible. However, as in
                            the case of other dependent territories, they are showing a marked sense
                            of responsibility and making persistent endeavors to work out
                            pragmatically arrangements acceptable to the various elements concerned.
                            Mr. Harold Wilson, Leader of the Labour Party, paid high tribute to Mr.
                            Butler's handling of this difficult situation in a conversation with a

                            and of our views as to how it should be handled. We have recognized that
                            this is essentially a British problem and sought to extend what

                                that Southern Rhodesia would face when granted independence under
                                the white minority government had considerably increased due to the
                                latest demands voiced by <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Field</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName>. He warned that
                                if independence were granted, it would mean that a situation where
                                250,000 whites would brutally dominate 3,800,000 Africans had been
                                finally decided upon. He asked the U.S. Government to condemn
                                publicly any attempt to grant independence before the present
                                constitution was amended so that every adult person had the right to
                                vote, and to caution the British Government regarding the bitter
                                consequences of such a step. (Telegram 3917 from London, April 8;

                        <p>The developments in the Southern Rhodesian situation during the past
                            several months have been followed with great interest and concern by my
                            colleagues in the United States Government as well as by our delegation
                            at the United Nations where, as you know, we are presently participating
                            in the discussions of the Southern Rhodesian question by the Committee
                            of 24. In the forum we have had an opportunity to express the United
                            States outlook on the difficulties and complexities facing all the
                            people of Southern Rhodesia. In that Committee our representative has
                            made known our support for what the British spokesman described as his
                            Government's wish to see established in Southern Rhodesia “a political
                            climate favorable to liberal and orderly constitutional development” and
                            his Government's readiness to give what help it can consistent with
                            their constitutional relationship with Southern Rhodesia. We have
                            expressed our hope that the new government of the Colony will not adopt
                            an adamant and uncompromising manner and that violence will not be
                            resorted to by any of the parties concerned. The United States has made
                            known its awareness of the complex nature of the internal problems of
                            Southern Rhodesia as well as its belief that the tides of official and
                            political change, like the tides of the ocean, cannot be halted.</p>
                        <p>Speaking officially for the United States, our representative, Mr. Sidney
                            R. Yates, on March 25, 1963 told the Committee that it was
                            understandable that there would be vehement objection to a system which
                            apparently froze political control in a privileged few by means of <pb
                                n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>unrealistic voting barriers
                            euphemistically designated as “qualifications”. On this occasion, as
                            during a previous debate last October, the US representative summarized
                            the hopes of the United States for Southern Rhodesia in the following
                            words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We believe the people of Southern Rhodesia should be given the
                                    opportunity for self-determination—of development of a
                                    government deriving its just powers from the consent of the
                                    governed—all the governed. We would hope and expect to see
                                    changes in the Constitution which would provide for a realistic
                                    liberalization of the franchise looking to universal adult
                                    suffrage.</p>
                                <p>“Secondly, we would hope and expect to see steps provided for to
                                    break down patterns of racial discrimination, to permit the
                                    development of a society which would permit each man to exercise
                                    his talents to the fullest, free from the imposition of any
                                    racial barriers.</p>
                                <p>“Thirdly, we would hope and expect that such self-determination
                                    would bring the establishment of peaceful and advantageous
                                    relations between Southern Rhodesia and its neighbors in Africa,
                                    an association founded on the freely-given support of the
                                    majority of the people concerned.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the same occasion Mr. Yates took note of previous public assurances by
                            the British spokesman in the Fourth Committee late last year that any
                            future change in the relationship between Southern Rhodesia and the
                            United Kingdom could not come about through unilateral action. The
                            United Kingdom has consistently maintained that Southern Rhodesia is
                            neither sovereign nor independent and has asserted its ultimate
                            international responsibility for Southern Rhodesia. Our spokesman, Mr.
                            Yates, stated emphatically that “for our part we do not believe that
                            independence should be granted to Southern Rhodesia until a more
                            satisfactory situation has been achieved within the territory”. On
                            behalf of the United States he urged the United Kingdom “to apply its
                            special influence, regardless of what its legal authority may be,
                            towards the rapid broadening of the franchise and the rapid elimination
                            of racial discrimination.” He pointed out, furthermore, that the United
                            Kingdom has a fine record of cooperation with the United Nations and
                            with the Secretary General. He expressed his confidence that it would
                            embellish that record in the case of Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>You may rest assured that the grave problems of Southern Rhodesia are
                            being followed by my Government with intense concern. Within recent
                            weeks, as you may know, I have had the opportunity of examining
                            personally many facets of the situation both in Salisbury and in London.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> has also
                            been taking a great personal interest in this pressing problem. All of
                            us will continue to do so in the hope that the leaders of Southern
                            Rhodesian opinion will appreciate the heavy responsibility which history
                            is placing upon their behavior and their decisions. It is particularly
                            hoped that the situation in Southern Rhodesia will not be allowed to
                            deteriorate for lack of contacts between the leaders of <pb n="532"
                                xml:id="pg_532" facs="0560"/>all elements of the population. We
                            consider it essential that a continuing dialogue be maintained and that
                            all parties would avoid regrettable precipitate action while there is
                            yet hope that a solution satisfactory to all may yet be achieved.</p>
                        <p>Thank you again for keeping my Government informed of your thoughts.</p>

                        <p>650. Southern Rhodesia. At initiative Ghana, and with general endorsement
                            African group, Security Council will begin debate on issue Southern
                            Rhodesia morning September 9. We expect Ghana will attempt to establish
                            that continuation of situation in Southern Rhodesia likely endanger
                            international peace and security and that British plans for dissolution
                            Federation Rhodesia and Nyasaland will result in transfer in near future
                            of effective power (including substantial armed forces) to present white
                            minority Government Southern Rhodesia. British, on other hand, expected
                            contend situation outside competence <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            and that any action by Council at this time will make it much more
                            difficult to achieve satisfactory solution.</p>
                        <p>US has followed situation in Southern Rhodesia carefully and maintains
                            sizable staff in Salisbury. We feel, therefore, we are in good position
                            arrive at independent evaluation of direction and speed of evolution
                            situation in Southern Rhodesia. We believe this summer's Victoria Falls
                            Conference dealing with procedures for transfer Federation powers to its
                            Southern Rhodesian, Northern Rhodesian and Nyasaland elements was
                            generally successful. Subsequent course events supports this evaluation.
                            For example, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland expected become independent
                            next year under black African governments.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing does not mean US underestimates complexity of dissolution
                            problem nor particular difficulties in Southern Rhodesia. Although we
                            believe British intentions and record good, we have consistently <pb

                            doing much to assure satisfactory outcome.</p>
                        <p>US has reached conclusion that any Security Council resolution on
                            question Southern Rhodesia likely be unhelpful in view extreme
                            complexity situation. While Ghana has insisted on this meeting and has
                            corralled substantial nominal African support, private indications are
                            that many African Governments recognize <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> consideration now untimely and not helpful in getting

                            grateful for the support received from the U.S. There was some annoyance
                            with the Norwegians.</p>

                        <p>In response to a question from the President Sir Roy opened the
                            conversation with a lengthy rehearsal of his well known views on the
                            situation <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0565"/>in Southern
                            Rhodesia—the need for gradualism, the rights of the whites as long term
                            inhabitants, multiracialism, etc.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Sir Roy's estimate of the practical possibility of
                            multiracialism in Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName> conceded that there will
                            be an eventual black majority but reiterated the case for gradualism. He
                            said the whites are fighting for time now and will use violence to
                            defend their basic interests. He expressed some discouragement and said
                            he doesn't see what the next step will be in light of black African
                            intransigence.</p>
                        <p>In response to another question from the President <persName
                                corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName> said that there will be no
                            closer links between Southern Rhodesia and South Africa and that
                            Verwoerd had “repudiated” Southern Rhodesia as already too liberal for
                            South African cooperation. He believes that South Africa will continue
                            down its present road until the sheer impact of reality reveals such
                            serious trouble as to make change unavoidable. However, he argued that
                            there would be some Zulu support for the <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                >SAG</gloss> in event of attack from the north.</p>
                        <p>When the President pressed him with regard to specific steps on the
                            Southern Rhodesian problem <persName corresp="#p_WSR1"
                                >Welensky</persName> expressed the hope that the United States will
                            pressure the British to propose a constitutional settlement. He will
                            urge Butler, in his forthcoming talks in London, to put to Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Field</persName> a proposal for
                            independence coupled to concessions to the black Africans—primarily the
                            blocking third and reform of the Land Apportionment Act. He insisted the
                            British must take the lead in proposing terms for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>When the President asked what would happen if no such settlement could be
                            reached, <persName corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName> said with
                            conviction that it is unthinkable not to find a solution and that the
                            British role and leadership are crucial. He added that his American trip
                            is really only a “facade” for his talks with Butler.</p>
                        <p>On African problems more generally <persName corresp="#p_WSR1"
                                >Welensky</persName> suggested that big power cooperation in
                            stabilizing commodity prices (he mentioned copper) would be a more
                            practical help to Africa than conventional foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that the tide of African nationalism is so
                            strong that as a practical matter we can only try to moderate and
                            influence, not stop it. He suggested that many of the problems are
                            pragmatic rather than moral.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WSR1">Welensky</persName> charged that the Congo
                            has regressed seventy years since independence and declared that in
                            spite of his own prior feelings, he feels that in the present situation
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must stay in the Congo to avoid
                            anarchy.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by the President, <persName corresp="#p_WSR1"
                                >Welensky</persName> observed that he does not think Communism is

                        <p>Mr. Sandys said that the British have made it clear that independ-ence
                            would not be granted on the basis of the present franchise. The
                            situation has now reached a point of deadlock. The Southern Rhodesian
                            Government will not go as far as the Afro-Asian countries want, and
                            these countries probably recognize that some compromise is necessary.
                            The Government is in a relatively strong position: one-tenth of the
                            population is white; they have their own European forces; the police
                            force is African but loyal to the Government.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary's question, Mr. Sandys said that he doubts
                            that the Southern Rhodesian Government will unilaterally declare its
                            independence. There are three possibilities: (1) a solution acceptable
                            to all (2) an illegal declaration of independence (3) Southern
                            Rhodesia's dropping its demand for early independence. The Southern
                            Rhodesians are probably aware of the serious effects of an illegal
                            declaration of independence. Moreover, what would they get out of it?
                            They now pass their own laws, have their own military forces, conduct
                            some of their external relations. They could not get into the United
                            Nations or the Commonwealth; their ability to obtain loans would be
                            wrecked. Since they would be on the “wrong side of the law,” they would
                            be exposing themselves to military attacks from outside. The Southern
                            Rhodesians may continue their clamor for independence, but probably
                            won't <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0568"/>go through with it. It is
                            not clear how long such a situation would last, but short of a solution
                            acceptable to all, it may be the best answer.</p>
                        <p>Sandys said he had been trying to obtain Commonwealth assistance in
                            finding a solution. Canada, Australia, Nigeria, and Tanganyika have
                            agreed to meet jointly with the British and Southern Rhodesians.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FW1">Field</persName>, however, rejects this
                            idea, although he says he is willing to have private informal talks with
                            some Commonwealth countries, presumably on a bilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the British have publicly stated they would not
                            grant independence on the basis of the present franchise. Sandys said
                            they had, and referred to his recent speech in Parliament. (He later
                            read excerpts from this speech.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that we had the impression that African countries
                            are taking a more moderate stand on the subject than a year ago. Mr.
                            Sandys agreed, but said he hoped the U.S. would help “take the heat out
                            of the subject,” particularly by using our influence at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="1" xml:id="d346fn1">On October
                                14, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 1883 (XVIII), “Question
                                of Southern Rhodesia,” by a vote of 90 to 2, with 13 abstentions
                                (including the United States). The United Kingdom did not
                                participate in the voting. The text of Resolution 1883 was
                                substantially the same as that of the draft Security Council
                                resolution vetoed by the United Kingdom on September 13. For text,

                        <p>The Secretary noted that several months ago he had asked Ambassador
                            Ormsby-Gore if the U.S. could privately tell the Africans that the
                            British had assured us that independence would not be granted on the
                            basis of the present electoral franchise. The Ambassador had demurred at
                            the time. Mr. Sandys said that he thought that what he and the Prime
                            Minister have said on this point (for example, his speech in Parliament)
                            adds up to a fairly clear expression of the British position, but the
                            British might be able to make a more precise statement if the U.S.
                            thinks it would be helpful.</p>

                        <p>621. For Ambassador from the Secretary. I have read Portuguese
                            presentation to <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> this week and I have
                            also received intelligence reports on developments in Angola. There is
                            great concern here that Portuguese repression in Angola is even bloodier
                            than has come to light. I am concerned that when details of true
                            situation in Angola inevitably come to public attention this will
                            greatly exacerbate situation for Portugal and for its friends in the
                            world. We plan to discuss the situation privately with French and
                            British and also to take it up in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.
                            In meantime at your discretion you might inform Portuguese officials of
                            our concern and of approach we plan for <gloss target="#t_NAC1"
                                >NAC</gloss>. Could also be pointed out that <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                >GOP</gloss> has not responded to our March 7 presentation, details
                            of which could be repeated.<note n="1" xml:id="d348fn1">Telegram 471 to
                                Lisbon, March 4. (Ibid., 753N.00/3-461)</note></p>
                        <p>We are also fearful that unless steps are taken and bloodshed stopped
                            Soviets may develop increasing inclination send arms to Africa for
                            distribution to Angolan underground. This will inevitably lead to
                            increasingly brutal and widespread Portuguese retaliation. Tempo such
                            developments may tend increase in Angola and that if measures are not
                            taken very soon there may be little chance for orderly change to come
                            about in that territory.</p>
                        <p>In discussing our concern with Portuguese officials you should indicate I

                                Paris, May 9, is not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                753N.00/5-961) On May 23, the Department of State instructed the
                                U.S. Representative to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> to
                                state, if the Portuguese Representative raised the issue, that the
                                U.S. Government had not provided support or aid to Angolan
                                terrorists, although such aid might have been provided by private
                                U.S. groups with no U.S. Government connections. He was also
                                instructed to say that <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Holden
                                    Roberto</persName> had a U.S. visa because he was not regarded
                                as inadmissible, and to point out that it was traditional U.S.
                                practice not to refuse interviews with political oppositionists when
                                they requested them. (<gloss target="#t_Topol1">Topol</gloss> 1649

                        <p>Regarding the background of this issue, it is true that the Union des
                            Populations d'Angola (<gloss target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss>) was involved
                            in the recent terrorism and that the Agency has been giving <persName

                                target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss>, financial assistance for some years.
                            The Department first learned of this connection last March when the
                            Agency raised with the Department the question as to whether it would be
                            in the U.S. interest to support the <gloss target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss>
                            itself. On March 22, the Department responded to the Agency to the
                            effect that we would be prepared to consider a proposal from the Agency
                            regarding possible support to the <gloss target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss> if
                            such support could be developed on a completely non-attributable basis.
                            The Department added that we would like to have a full background sketch
                            of <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Roberto</persName> as well as information
                            on the <gloss target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss>, its mission, present sources
                            of support, etcetera.</p>
                        <p>In response to this the Agency sent us a biographic sketch of <persName

                            it was not necessary for the Agency to advance <persName

                            aid and support to the terrorists in Angola.</p>
                        <p>This would mean, as a minimum, two steps: (1) to stop any regular monthly

                        <p>I am not suggesting any attempt to interrupt any aid which the American
                            Committee for Africa might give him as a private matter. Nor do I

                            to overcome such risks but is enough to involve the US Government in the
                            charge that we are supporting terrorism aimed at men, women and children

                        <p>As a matter of utterly fundamental policy, a country like the United
                            States must use its influence to moderate oppressive regimes on the one
                            side and terrorist movements on the other. We cannot do the former
                            unless our hands are clean with respect to the latter. Nor can the
                            Secretary of State or the President be put in the position of lying on
                            such matters; the answer is not that we two need not just be informed;
                            there are too many situations where such activities can be surfaced and
                            the lie be proved.</p>

                            scheduled, the Defense Department has submitted a Military Annex which
                            invalidates a large portion of the work already done. The major problem
                            the task force now has before it is to define clearly the difference
                            between the view of the State Department and the Defense Department with
                            respect to the Azores base.</p>
                        <p>State feels strongly that we must maintain our posture as a champion of
                            self-determination in Africa as set forth in our position on the <pb
                                n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0574"/>Angolan problem in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. They see the continuance of this policy
                            as absolutely necessary if the U.S. is to have good relations with the
                            Afro-Asian and many other Free World states. They feel that the U.S. and
                            its allies must press Portugal strongly to undertake adequate reforms in
                            its African territories now. They believe quite correctly that the time
                            may come when, because of this policy, the Portuguese may withdraw from
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and/or demand that the U.S.
                            evacuate the Azores base. State's view is that if and when this
                            situation arises, the U.S. must be prepared to abandon the base and/or
                            see Portugal withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the
                            interest of larger and more important considerations.</p>
                        <p>According to the Military Annex, Defense is concerned lest “precipitant
                            and overly aggressive implementation of the policy produce reactions on
                            the part of Portugal and, possibly, Spain which would result in an
                            unacceptable reduction of U.S. capabilities to support required military
                            missions to Berlin, Western Europe, and the Middle East and Africa.” The
                            Military Annex states further: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is the view of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> that
                                    retention of U.S. military facilities in the Azores and Spain is
                                    vital to our ability to execute required military missions under
                                    wartime and emergency conditions. Accordingly, courses of action
                                    which would gravely jeopardize retention of the Azores and bases
                                    in Spain would be unacceptable from a military point of view for
                                    the foreseeable future.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In the present draft of the task force paper, the extent of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s belief in this view is reflected in a
                            caveat over all the recommendations for action which states, “Keeping in
                            mind the sensitivity of base rights problems and our <gloss

                        <p>Faced with this dilemma, Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"

                            future strategy. Following that meeting, Williams now has in mind
                            meeting with you or Walt and, finally, he plans to have a meeting with
                            his counterparts in Defense. All these meetings notwithstanding, I do
                            not believe he will get Defense to alter its view at this stage.</p>

                                the use of American equipment in Angola. I also understand that a
                                recent story in a London newspaper reported the finding of a ‘Made

                                This is going to present problems to us both in Angola and in

                                the reaction of Portuguese Foreign Minister Franco Nogueira to his
                                demarche in telegram 240 from Lisbon, August 16. (Kennedy Library,
                                National Security Files, Countries Series, Angola,
                                8/61-12/61)</note> The Portuguese Foreign Minister informed our
                            Ambassador that it was not a question of arms supply since they have
                            alternate sources, including the Communist bloc, but the important fact
                            was the hostile attitude of an ally in the face of the crisis
                            confronting Portugal. The Foreign Minister said Portugal's national
                            interest was paramount, and that the Portuguese would have no interest
                            in a U.S. victory over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if this
                            meant that Portugal itself would be lost.</p>
                        <p>In view of the Portuguese reaction, the Secretary of State feels that a
                            public statement at this time would only further infuriate them. If
                            inquiry is made, the Department is prepared to state that “the U.S.
                            Government is currently reviewing the whole question of the supply of
                            military equipment for Portuguese overseas territories and in the
                            meantime such shipments have been suspended.” The Secretary of Defense
                            feels that “for the immediate future, the success of our efforts to
                            restrain the Portuguese from the use of U.S. materiel already in Angola
                            is indeed problematical"… and that “a quiet, persistent, but
                            unpublicized campaign appealing to the Portuguese understanding of our
                            position might in time be successful. The critical military importance
                            of our rights and continued use of our facilities in the Azores, and of
                            securing extension of our rights in negotiations which must be
                            undertaken in 1962, are such that any further public pressure on the
                            Portuguese regarding the use of U.S. military materiel in Angola should
                            be avoided.” The Secretary of State feels that Portuguese reaction to
                            our restrictive arms policy and our over-all policy with respect to
                            Portugal's overseas territories makes the outlook for the successful
                            extension of the Azores base agreement less hopeful.</p>
                        <p>My own feeling is that the departments are adequately following through
                            on this problem for the time being. We will keep close watch on it from
                            here and keep you informed of any new developments. We shall wish, at
                            any rate, to bring you fully up to date on the over-all problem of
                            Portugal and its African territories before the new Portuguese
                            Ambassador presents his credentials.</p>

                            <item>Your Meeting with the New Portuguese Ambassador Pedro
                                Pereira</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You are now scheduled to receive the new ambassador's credentials at 1200
                            on Friday (September 15). The State Department has sent you very
                            thorough briefing papers, but you should be aware of several additional
                            points which are outlined below.</p>
                        <p>The signs are that our relations with the Portuguese are going to be very
                            difficult in the forthcoming period. They apparently intend to pull out
                            all the stops in an attempt to bring about a turn-around in our policies
                            toward Portugal and its African territories. The accounts of Pereira's
                            first meetings with the Secretary of State are far from encouraging.
                            Pereira continued to expound the rigid Salazar line of equating
                            Communism and African nationalism. Moreover, we doubt seriously that the
                            much-touted reforms in the African territories will be far-reaching
                            enough or carried out fast enough to allow the Portuguese to remain in
                            Africa without extensive and continuing use of military force.</p>
                        <p>In addition, a group of Portuguese businessmen—“The Overseas Companies of
                            Portugal"—have awarded the public relations firm Selvage and Lee a
                            contract of a million dollars “to place the affairs of Portugal and
                            Angola in a true and proper perspective” in the United States. $500
                            thousand of this amount is to be spent over the first twelve-month
                            period.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we expect that the Angolan item will be inscribed almost
                            immediately on the agenda of the General Assembly which opens on
                            September 19, either by the Africans or the bloc. There is every reason
                            to believe that Portugal will be more sharply denounced than ever
                            before.</p>
                        <p>You also should know that, on the same day the General Assembly opens,
                            the National Broadcasting Company is showing a one-half hour television
                            film on Angola which is strongly anti-Portuguese. It is necessary that
                            you know this because there reportedly are jeeps and napalm bombs shown
                            in the film which might well be of U.S. origin. As State and <pb n="551"
                                xml:id="pg_551" facs="0579"/>Defense reported to you earlier, the
                            U.S. sometime ago instituted a system of control of arms to Portugal,
                            but we have never announced this publicly. In this connection, there is
                            strong feeling in town that the U.S. should make a public statement to
                            the effect that the U.S. will henceforth refuse to make available any
                            arms to Portugal that are to be used in the African territories. A
                            statement of this kind was made by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            on June 27 in Parliament.</p>

                                    minimize the possibility of losing the Azores, recognizing the
                                    grave military consequences which would attend such a loss.”</p>

                        <p>The arrival of a new, probably very active ambassador, the expected
                            activities of the public relations firm, the U.N. debates and the <gloss

                            more outspoken than we have been in the past, especially with regard to
                            the use of U.S. arms in Africa. This is one point we think you should
                            stress.</p>

                        <p>With the end of Portuguese rule in Goa, Diu and Damao and the annexation
                            of Fort Ajuda in August by Dahomey, the image of Portugal in Africa has
                            been severely damaged. Although until recently regarded by the Angolans,
                            Mozambiques and the Portuguese Guineans as a hard and invincible
                            overlord, Portugal will now be regarded as vulnerable; as a nation
                            rapidly in decline. The activities of the insurgents almost certainly
                            will be stepped up, and there is abundant reason to believe their
                            activities will be more successful this year than last.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, Tanganyika is now independent and Nyerere will be willing
                                to provide safe haven for guerrillas operating in Mozambique—the
                                first time that this will be possible. You may recall that we
                                expected an explosion in Mozambique during the Angolan disturbances
                                last summer; one reason it didn't occur was that Mozambique was
                                surrounded by totally unsympathetic neighbors—the two Rhodesias,
                                South Africa and the then U.K. trust territory of Tanganyika.</item>
                            <item>Second, if we ever achieve a situation in the Congo even bordering
                                on calm, the Congolese will most certainly aid and encourage the
                                Angolan insurgents operating from and living in the Congo. This has
                                been the insurgents base for mounting their operations in Angola. It
                                should be a more effective one in the future.</item>
                            <item>Third, there are now considerably more trained Angolan guerrilla
                                fighters than there were a year ago. Training has continued in the
                                Congo. Training has taken place in Tunisia and Algeria and possibly
                                in Guinea and Ghana. <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Holden
                                    Roberto</persName>—the most promising leader among the Angolan
                                nationalists—told the State people last month that active guerrilla
                                operations would soon be resumed inside Angola. The rainy season has
                                only just begun and, according to <persName corresp="#p_RH3"
                                    >Roberto</persName>, “the elephant grass is not yet high enough
                                and there is need for more arms.” The rainy season is ideal for
                                guerrilla warfare in Angola because the roads—which are vital to the
                                Portuguese—are impassable and the guerrillas can operate from the
                                bush. The New York Times has reported that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RH3">Roberto</persName>, while in New York, said his
                                movement would accept humanitarian support from any country, but
                                went on to emphasize that direct military aid would be <pb n="554"
                                    xml:id="pg_554" facs="0582"/>accepted only from African
                                countries. There is no doubt in my mind that the arms can and will
                                be acquired in ever-increasing amounts.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I point all of this out because I think that the Portuguese colonies
                            possibly will present one of the toughest problems in all of Africa. We
                            should plan constantly, utilizing the best brains in town, in order to
                            make sure that we are in the strongest possible position if and when
                            great trouble comes. The Angola Task Force was a small forward step, but
                            its conclusions and recommendations need to be reexamined, up-dated and
                            fortified if the demands of U.S. policy in the forth-coming period are
                            to be met.</p>
                        <p>Ever since the Task Force exercise, I have felt that a small group of
                            carefully chosen high-level people could accomplish more than by any
                            other means. The group should be chaired by someone like <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>, Alexis Johnson or someone
                            from the White House. I think this is the next step we should take.</p>
                        <p>The best man at State on this problem is <persName corresp="#p_DOH1"
                                >Olcott Deming</persName>. Ken Hansen also has a strong background
                            on the problem and played a vigorous role during the Task Force
                            exercise.</p>
                        <p>I have attached a memorandum to the President which I wrote in

                        <p>A draft resolution on Angola, sponsored by a group of forty-two
                            Afro-Asians, was introduced in the General Assembly on January 23 (text
                            attached as Tab A).<note n="1" xml:id="d357fn1">Not attached to the

                                Angola,” which was adopted by the General Assembly on January 30 by
                                a vote of 99 (including the United States) to 2 with 1 abstention,
                                see American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962 pp.
                                949-950.</note> It will probably come to a vote early next week. The
                            draft goes somewhat beyond earlier General Assembly resolutions on
                            Angola, but is essentially moderate in that it neither condemns Portugal
                            nor suggests sanctions. To this extent it represents a victory for the
                            more reasonable members of the Afro-Asian group. However, there are
                            several elements in the resolution which we would prefer to see

                        <p>We have also weighed carefully whether the United States should vote
                            affirmatively on the resolution even if our minimal changes are not
                            accepted. There are a number of important factors involved. We have to
                            take into account that the moderates among the Afro-Asians have sought
                            to keep the resolution moderate with a view to getting our affirmative
                            vote. We need to encourage them to continue such efforts in the future.
                            We also believe it is important that we maintain what has come to be
                            regarded as a significant forward movement by your Administration on
                            colonial questions. A key factor is our relations with Portugal. While
                            an affirmative vote by the United States would come as no surprise to
                            the Portuguese, it is clear that the substance of the resolution goes
                            beyond the position which we informed the Portuguese we were adopting in
                            the <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0584"/>United Nations. It is not
                            possible to assess with precision the extent of the adverse effects of
                            an affirmative vote on the various facets of our relations with
                            Portugal, specifically: the retention of our Azores base rights,
                            Portuguese participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and
                            Portuguese membership in the United Nations. On balance, our best
                            judgment inclines toward the view that Portugal will not make our
                            affirmative vote an immediately decisive factor of retaliation on the
                            Azores question, though the cumulative effect of all of our votes on the
                            Angola question, will undoubtedly be taken fully into account by the
                            Portuguese at such time as US-Portuguese negotiations are begun. This
                            point has been discussed informally with Bill Bundy (Defense Department)
                            who shares a similar assessment.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> favors an
                            affirmative vote on the resolution. There is no doubt that an abstention
                            on the resolution would be widely regarded as a retreat from the
                            position adopted by your Administration last spring.</p>
                        <p>In light of the foregoing considerations, I have sent out instructions to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> which
                            authorizes an affirmative vote on the resolution as a whole, even if our
                            minimal changes are not accepted. In addition, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> would make an interpretive
                            statement regarding the resolution which would put on record our
                            reservations regarding certain provisions in the draft.</p>

                        <p>For your information, the following is an excerpt from a Memorandum of
                            Conversation between the President and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAEII1">Adlai Stevenson</persName> on May 2:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Azores</hi>. The President said that in the nature
                            of things the two issues—Azores and Angola—cannot be separated because
                            Portugal will not permit them to be separated. The Ambassador said that,
                            since the Azores were important not only to American security but to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as a whole, he felt that more
                            of an effort should be made to seek the cooperation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, as well as Brazil, in
                            bringing pressure on Portugal. He reported that he had talked to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> along these lines,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MHS2">Macmillan</persName> had said that
                            Britain would be glad to cooperate to this end, and that Sir <persName
                                corresp="#p_DSP1">Patrick Dean</persName> was ready to do anything
                            he could.</p>
                        <p>The Acheson memorandum was discussed.<note n="1" xml:id="d359fn1">The
                                April 25 memorandum, prepared by former Secretary of State Dean
                                Acheson at Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
                                request, urged that the United States make a determined effort to
                                create a more favorable climate for renewal of the Azores Base
                                Agreement, which was due to expire at the end of 1962. (Kennedy
                                Library, Cleveland Papers, Azores, 4/62-6/62)</note> With regard to
                            Acheson's recommendation that the US not participate in drafting any
                            more resolutions on Angola, the Ambassador said that American
                            participation was essential in order to moderate the resolution; without
                            American participation, any resolution on Angola would be much more
                            extreme. Acheson's recommendation that aid to Angolan nationalists be
                            stopped was not discussed.</p>

                        <p>The difficulties which we are now having with the leaders of the new
                            Algerian Government must recall to the President's mind with particular
                            force the following sentence in his 1957 Senate speech on Algeria:
                            “Instead of abandoning African nationalism to the anti-Western agitators
                            and Soviet agents who hope to capture its leadership, the United States,
                            a product of political revolution, must redouble its efforts to earn the
                            respect and friendship of nationalist leaders.” There can be little
                            doubt that our current difficulties stem in part from the fact that this
                            Government at the insistence of the French Government for a considerable
                            time cut itself off from anything other than covert contact with the
                            leaders of the Algerian independence movement.</p>
                        <p>Our Algerian experience shows that covert contact is not enough.
                            Nationalist leaders seek overt, public association with us as a means of
                            bolstering their position at home and abroad. If we deny them this
                            support, they are the more grateful for—and the more swayed by—the
                            public backing they receive from the Communists.</p>
                        <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0589"/>
                        <p>The recent decision that <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Holden
                                Roberto</persName> should not be received at <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> or the Department has moved me to
                            place before you once again the AF view of the critical importance to
                            long-range U.S. interests of maintaining effective contact with
                            nationalist leaders in the remaining African dependent territories.
                            Whether self-determination or independ-ence is to come early or late to
                            these remaining dependencies, nationalist movements have come into being
                            in each of them. The hopes and beliefs, attitudes and intentions of the
                            adherents of these movements will be influenced by the contacts of their
                            leaders during the formative period. If we cut ourselves off from these
                            leaders, the result can only be, as the President said in 1957, to
                            abandon them to anti-Western agitators and Soviet agents.</p>
                        <p>This may be particularly true with respect to the Angolan nationalist
                            movement. <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Roberto</persName>, the leader of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UPA1">UPA</gloss>, has sought to remain aloof from
                            the Communists. The leaders of the other major group, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA1">MPLA</gloss>, admit to connection with the
                            Communists. By turning our back on <persName corresp="#p_RH3"
                                >Roberto</persName>, we may force him to an accommodation with the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA1">MPLA</gloss> and thus ease the way for the
                            expansion of Communist influence throughout the Angolan nationalist
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>Our policy of aloofness may also prevent our acquiring some influence
                            with the <gloss target="#t_MPLA1">MPLA</gloss>. The newly chosen head of
                            that group, Agostinho Neto, has recently let it be known that he would
                            like to have overt contact with our Embassy in Leopoldville. If we could
                            establish relations with him, we might be able to counteract Communist
                            influence in his group.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese, of course, tell us that <persName corresp="#p_RH3"
                                >Roberto</persName> is a terrorist, and it is true that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RH3">Roberto</persName>'s group stimulated the
                            insurrection in northern Angola. It is clear from the record, however,
                            that today's terrorist is tomorrow's statesman, and much as we deplore
                            the use of violence to obtain political ends, we cannot in our own
                            interest refuse to deal with nationalist leaders because they resort to
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>The problem of contact with nationalist leaders has been with us since
                            the beginning of the Republic. With occasional exceptions (e.g.
                            Algeria), we have traditionally kept our doors open to these leaders
                            despite the displeasure of the established authorities. The
                            Administration has until recently adhered to this traditional position,
                            but it now seems to AF that the doors are closing. Thus to deny our
                            heritage in this last stage of the dissolution of the Western colonial
                            empires would, I believe, seriously damage our position in much of the
                            free world. I <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0590"/>would like very

                                    corresp="#p_MGGC2">McGhee</persName> stated that he did not
                                believe that <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> should
                                at that time press for review of U.S. contacts with African
                                nationalist leaders and reminded the Assistant Secretary of the
                                importance of the current U.S. negotiations with Portugal, which had
                                given rise to U.S. commitments regarding contacts with Portuguese
                                revolutionary leaders. The Under Secretary argued that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> should accept those
                                commitments for the time being and not keep raising the subject as
                                AF repeatedly had done. (Memorandum from <persName

                        <p>The President told the Foreign Minister he was glad to see him, and that
                            he welcomed the chance of discussing with him the general state of
                            relations between our two countries. He said he was aware that there
                            were certain differences between us on how to handle various problems,
                            but he hoped that means might be found to draw our two countries closer
                            together again, in the atmosphere of friendship and cooperation which is
                            characteristic of our traditional relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the President for receiving him and said
                            that he on his part wished to do all that he could to improve relations.
                                <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0591"/>He agreed that there were
                            certain differences between us which were in part due to the importance
                            which the United States attaches to the United Nations, and to the role
                            which the United States plays there. He said that Portugal had certain
                            vital national interests in Africa which are under attack and that
                            Portugal was defending not only her own interests but those of the free
                            world. He said that the whole of Africa was unstable politically, and
                            that if things continued as they are now going the African Continent
                            would become Communist.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that the broad currents of nationalism in the
                            world, including Africa, were creating new demands and stimulating new
                            aspirations on the part of the peoples of Africa, and that unless
                            farsighted and forward looking policies were adopted to meet these
                            demands, we would run into even greater difficulties and make our tasks
                            harder. He said that it was evident from what had happened to former
                            French, Belgian, and British territories in Africa that these pressures
                            stemmed from the basic desires of the populations and were not due to
                            any external agency. He said that the United States had not played a
                            large role in Africa. However, we were concerned that events should move
                            in direct consistency with the broad and peaceful interests of the free
                            world and hoped that the Portuguese Government would pursue policies
                            which would lead toward the creation and strengthening of free
                            societies.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister repeated at some length the classic Portuguese
                            position with regard to the United Nations, and said that it was a forum
                            for the formulation of extreme, unreasonable, and hostile accusations
                            and demands, which could not be met without creating chaos and paving
                            the way for Communist domination.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Foreign Minister whether Portugal could not see
                            its way to proclaiming publicly its acceptance of the principle of
                            self-determination. This would constitute an important move forward by
                            Portugal in the direction of protecting and preserving her position and
                            influence in Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Portugal was not opposed to the principle
                            of self-determination, but that it was not possible for her to take a
                            public position on this. Were she to do so, the Afro-Asian members of
                            the United Nations would then call on her to carry out immediately the
                            provisions of the resolutions that had already been voted, calling for
                            the prompt granting of independence to Angola and Mozambique “by the end
                            of this year”.</p>
                        <p>The conversation concluded with the President expressing his hope that
                            ways would be found to reduce the differences between us so that
                            Portugal and the United States could cooperate more closely in the face
                            of the many grave problems facing both countries.</p>

                        <p>1558. Subject: Angola. We most concerned over reported move introduce
                            Committee 17 draft res on Angola into plenary and believe we should wage
                            major battle to muster blocking third against its passage.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d362fn1">The Committee of 17's draft resolution condemned
                                the mass extermination of the population of Angola and Portugal's
                                colonial war; requested all U.N. members to deny Portugal any
                                support which could be used to suppress the Angolan people and to
                                terminate the supply of arms to Portugal; and asked the Security
                                Council to take appropriate measures, including sanctions, to secure
                                Portugal's compliance. On December 18, the General Assembly adopted
                                a resolution very similar to the Committee of 17 resolution by a
                                vote of 54 to 14 (including the United States), with 18 abstentions.

                                954-955.</note> This resolution aimed not only at Portugal but also

                        <p>We realize that vote in Committee of 17 has made your position most
                            difficult. However, <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss> intends

                                >NATO</gloss> Capital at once should any division develop. You
                            should make it clear that this res totally out of keeping with Salamanca
                            Report on which consideration of Angola question should logically be
                            based. You should also point out that <gloss target="#t_GOP1"

                            visiting mission, announcement of reforms, participation in debate,
                            willingness accept rapporteur should call, if not for recognition in
                            resolution, at least for some diminution in its tone and temper.</p>
                        <p>In corridor discussions we believe you should take following line. (1) US
                            position on self-determination for Angola peoples is constant. To
                            advance towards this goal we put heaviest diplomatic pressures on GOP
                            and our efforts met with success: Portugal agreed accept rapporteur. (2)
                            In spite of this forward step, and in spite of new spirit of moderation
                            Portugal has displayed at this <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, some
                            Africans and Asians apparently intend to torpedo this progress by
                            introduction of propagandistic resolution. (3) Resolution factually
                            wrong on following points: (a) reference to mass extermination of
                            indigenous population is fantasy. While Portuguese claims of peace,
                            order and normalcy are undoubtedly overdone, we know from our own
                            reports and assessments that this much nearer to <pb n="565"
                                xml:id="pg_565" facs="0593"/>truth than wild charges of mass
                            extermination; (b) no arms being supplied by “certain member states”
                            i.e. US, for Portuguese use in Angola; (c) accusations that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> denies all rights and freedoms,
                            practices racial discrimination and uses forced labor are at best
                            distortions of truth and, as far as forced labor concerned, explicitly
                            contradicts findings of <gloss target="#t_ILO1">ILO</gloss> report. (5)
                            US of opinion Salamanca group did responsible job and we ready support
                            resolution roughly along lines recommended paragraph 227 of report. In
                            particular attention all should be called to para 230 which states that
                            chances of peaceful solution would be greatly enhanced if member states
                            tried convince <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> of need to “face
                            political realities and adjust its policies thereto.” This exactly what
                            US has done and precisely what <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> has
                            taken step toward. Tragedy is that entire effort will go for naught
                            because of penchant of some nations heap more and more abuse on
                            Portugal.</p>
                        <p>Dept aware our drive to defeat resolution could possibly endanger
                            whatever chances remain for success rapporteur initiative. On other
                            hand, you have indicated rapporteur has no chance unless <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> agrees more than one representative and
                            blocking third against extreme res may be what is required to increase
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> flexibility on this point.</p>

                            on the Hill. He apologized to the Ambassador for not being able to get
                            back to him earlier. The Ambassador said that he was under instructions
                            to approach the Secretary or Acting <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566"
                                facs="0594"/>Secretary to take up the question of our position on

                            Portuguese-African territories.<note n="1" xml:id="d363fn1">On April 4,
                                the Committee of 24 (formerly the Committee of 17) adopted a draft
                                resolution noting with deep regret and great concern the continued
                                refusal of Portugal to cooperate in implementation of the U.N.
                                resolutions relating to the territories under its administration;
                                noting that Portugal had continued its repressive measures against
                                the indigenous population by the use of military and other forces;
                                and drawing the attention of the Security Council to the present
                                situation with a view to its taking appropriate measures, including
                                sanctions, to secure Portugal's compliance with the relevant
                                resolutions. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 19 to 0, with 5
                                abstentions (including the United States).</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained the position that Mr.
                            Yates had taken during the afternoon's discussion in New York.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d363fn2">U.S. Representative Sidney Yates had stated
                                that because the United States was in sympathy with the attitude
                                reflected in the draft resolution, it would not vote against the
                                text as a whole. However, since the United States also had serious
                                objections to some of the resolution's provisions, it could not vote
                                for the resolution and would abstain.</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that we had felt our
                            position would have been helped if the Portuguese delegation in New York
                            had had advance talks with us on the position that they were going to
                            take. The Ambassador said that he was very disappointed in the position
                            taken by the United States and was sure that his Government would share
                            that view. He wondered why we had apparently changed our position from
                            the strong and determined one we took in the General Assembly last
                            December.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that we took an
                            affirmative position only on the matters where we had consistently
                            expressed views in the past. As far as the sanctions were concerned, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we were very
                            definite in our opposition. The Ambassador explained that he had hoped
                            that the US, because of its position in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>—the fact that it sets an example for other nations—could
                            have taken a different position. He said that he considered this quite a
                            setback. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reiterated that
                            quite frankly we could have been more useful in persuading other nations
                            if the Portuguese Government had been a little more forthcoming. In our
                            opinion, the Afro-Asian Bloc had tried to be a little more restrained
                            than they had in the past. After all, all they were suggesting was the
                            reception of a mission to undertake discussions, and it had not seemed
                            to us that the response of the Portuguese Government furnished any
                            opportunity to start conversations in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> that would be useful. The Ambassador explained that his
                            Government had tried to be helpful but within their interpretation of
                            the true meaning of the Charter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that as far as we could interpret the nature
                            of the mission, the Portuguese were contemplating a kind of meeting with
                            neighboring countries which would really be outside the framework of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Ambassador replied that he
                            had thought that they were working within the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> because the original agreements and understandings would
                            be based on recommendations and procedures of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0595"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded by saying once
                            again that greater advance consultation with our delegation in New York
                            should have occurred and that simply handing us a note did not make it
                            easy for us to appreciate the Portuguese Government's intentions. The
                            Ambassador said that he understood and thanked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> very much for his call.</p>

                                <p>After years of advocating moral suasion and peaceful evolution
                                    and opposing coercive measures, such as sanctions and ostracism,
                                    our moderate approach has not moved Portugal toward acceptance
                                    of self-determination. At the recent Addis Ababa Conference of
                                    African Chiefs of State, the Africans made clear their
                                    determination to see an end put to Portuguese domination of its
                                    African territories, one way or another.</p>
                                <p>African diplomatic pressures are increasing on the United States
                                    as foremost among those countries (the United Kingdom and France
                                    are the others) believed to have it in their power to effect a
                                    peaceful change in Portuguese policies. The avowed intent of the
                                    Africans is to force us either to bring about an acceptable
                                    solution or choose between Portugal on the one hand and Africa
                                    on the other.</p>
                                <p>Ambassador Korry has reported from Addis Ababa on his talks with
                                    many African Chiefs of State and Foreign Ministers, “it would be
                                    a fatal error in my view to believe that the summit merely
                                    produced resolutions.” The African walkout at the <gloss

                                    on to say that failure of the United States to take positive
                                    action with respect to Portugal “could negate our material aid
                                    and political gains of the past year (in Africa).” Sekou Toure
                                    is sending a personal letter to you making essentially the same
                                    point. Recent actions such as Congolese recognition of the
                                    Angolan Government-in-Exile, Liberian intention to expel
                                    Portuguese nationals, and the United Arab Republic and Ethiopia
                                    breaking of relations with Portugal show the determination of
                                    the Africans. There are indications that the Communists will
                                    make a major effort to exploit this issue to compensate for
                                    their failures in the Congo, Guinea, Algeria and elsewhere in
                                    Africa.</p>
                                <p>Such friendly and responsible leaders as Houphouet-Boigny of the

                                    of Tanganyika have told us that their ability to resist
                                    pressures for a radical, violent solution will depend in good
                                    part on the extent to which they can show that the United States
                                    is moving with them in an effort to reach a peaceful and
                                    evolutionary solution. They cannot publicly take issue with

                                    We believe that these individuals and a number of other African
                                    leaders as well are willing to settle for less than <pb n="570"

                                    member which owns the Azores. We seek to maintain close
                                    relations with Portugal despite our strong disagreements with
                                    its colonial policy. Too sharp a break with our past position
                                    may cause Portugal to decide to terminate our use of the Azores,
                                    to adopt a policy of non-cooperation with or even withdrawal
                                    from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and to cancel the
                                    Radio Free Europe broadcasting agreement. We believe the course

                                    the above steps might be taken by Portugal, but we believe it
                                    can be implemented so as to minimize the possible adverse
                                    reaction of the Portuguese. However, at the same time it is
                                    prudent that we consider on a contingency basis any alternatives

                                <p>The totality of U.S. interests argues strongly for a further step
                                    forward, analogous to our action in the Security Council on
                                    Angola in March 1961 and our support for the <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operation in the Congo. It also
                                    seems clear that the best time to take the forward step is when
                                    the Security Council meets late in July. Whatever action we take
                                    at that time will have a maximum impact, enabling us to extract
                                    more initial mileage by a smaller step than would otherwise be
                                    the case.</p>
                                <p>We have prepared a set of policy recommendations for actions to
                                    be taken on the issue of Portuguese territories at the United
                                    Nations beginning with the Security Council. These
                                    recommendations are designed to preserve the opportunity for a
                                    peaceful solution, to protect U.S. interests in Africa and to
                                    seek to minimize the danger of a sharp break with Portugal.
                                    Although they are not sufficient to produce a solution, they
                                    seem to offer a balanced way of handling the present
                                phase.</p></item>

                                    appropriate alternative to Chapter VII sanctions; and (c) to

                                    For our part, we should do everything possible to encourage our

                                refrain from actions rendering more difficult the peaceful and
                                timely achievement of self-determination in the Portuguese African

                        <p>We have supported most of the above elements in previous resolutions
                            either in the General Assembly or the Security Council. The new features
                            would be their combination in a hortatory (Chapter VI) Security Council
                            resolution, the inclusion of a call for nationalist leaders to
                            participate in negotiations directed toward establishing a timetable for
                            self-determination, and a partial arms embargo paragraph. This latter
                            element would “codify” in a Security Council resolution our present arms
                            policy. The United Kingdom sees no problem with such a provision. We
                            have previously voted for a general provision to this effect in the
                            General Assembly in January, 1962 which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Requests all States Members of the United Nations and members of
                                    the specialized agencies to deny Portugal any support and
                                    assistance which may be used by it for the suppression of the
                                    people of Angola.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>We believe it is possible to develop a consensus among the majority of
                            the Security Council along the above lines which would be acceptable to
                            the United States. At the same time, our taking the lead in developing
                            such a forthcoming resolution should enable us to ensure that no
                            unacceptable resolution calling for sanctions under Chapter VII of the
                            Charter or expulsion of Portugal from the Organization will receive the
                            minimum seven votes required for adoption.</p>

                                1951 US-Portuguese letter of understanding which committed us, on
                                Portuguese request, to permit use of US supplied arms in Portuguese
                                Africa. Since our freedom of action on Portugal is in fact greatly
                                limited so long as this understanding is in force, it was agreed
                                that State and Defense would review the problem and possible
                                renunciation of the 1951 agreement, for later Presidential
                                consideration.</item>

                            <item>The President suggested that we should so far as possible, sit
                                back and let others take the lead. He thought the French might use
                                an American lead as a pretext to criticize us to the Portuguese. He
                                thought we should listen to the Africans, Portuguese, etc., express
                                our concern but offer no specific solutions, and let the situation
                                develop next week. He agreed that the timing of any compromise
                                proposal must remain a matter of judgment and flexibility.</item>

                                resolution since this would simply ensure a possibly drastic
                                resolution in the Assembly in the fall.</item>

                            <item>The President agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                    >McNamara</persName> that, even if we reach the point of
                                ourselves surfacing such idea as a mediator scheme, we should avoid
                                if at all possible taking the lead on any embargo proposal. The
                                State Department undertook, at the President's request, to revise
                                our draft resolution language to soften the onesided effect of arms
                                embargo language against Portugal.</item>

                                    >Stevenson</persName> in light of the guidance of this
                                discussion and the President's desire to avoid a conspicuous
                                American initiative to use his own discretion in the development of
                                tactics of a Security Council debate. He stressed, however, that in
                                light of the critical issues up this year, such as a possible test
                                ban treaty, it is of the utmost importance to avoid a risk of losing
                                the Azores.</item>

                                    seek to satisfy the objectives of the moderate Africans in the
                                    Security Council while refraining from initiating or supporting

                                    not likely to risk the loss of the Azores. It would attempt to
                                    preserve our position in Africa by giving the moderates
                                    something to take home, thereby helping to neutralize those who
                                    seek a militant and a violent solution rather than a peaceful
                                    one. It would decrease the opportunities for the Communists to

                                <p>Objective is to get started a process of peaceful change,
                                    stimulated by an independent political negotiator. As you have
                                    recommended, we should insist on a single rapporteur, not a
                                    three-man Commission. As consultations proceed, please consider
                                    whether it would be useful to establish a time period during
                                    which rapporteur would be trying to get dialogue under way, with
                                    the idea that special restraint on arms supply or other
                                    non-peaceful acts in or around territories, might be exercised
                                    during such period.</p></item>

                                <p>While US should assist as necessary to bring about consensus
                                    along above lines, it is important that we not seem to be in a
                                    leadership position especially in those elements of package
                                    (notably arms embargo) that will be particularly offensive to
                                    Portuguese. Every effort should be made to get French, British,
                                    and some members of “middle group” (Norway, Brazil, Venezuela,
                                    Philippines) to take lead in developing consensus around
                                    moderate resolution that can be viable alternative to African
                                    starting position. Within this general framework, you have full
                                    tactical discretion on how much of our position to reveal, when,
                                    and to whom.</p>
                                <p>You will presumably be seeing Nogueira early in the process. You
                                    should discuss with him entire <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>

                                    Portuguese, but also bring out frankly above difficulties which

                                    and we of course will support hearing Portuguese. If Slim's

                                    followed, we can expect that Tunisia, Sierra Leone, Madagascar
                                    and Liberia will ask to represent the Africans as interested
                                    parties. We believe that such procedure would be reasonable and

                            review by the first of the week the bidding on the Security Council

                            are suffering some blows which, rightly or wrongly, are likely to

                                leaders, and to make sure that they talked about the right things,
                                including the means of exercising self-determination. Thus, the
                                United States found the draft resolution unacceptable, since some of
                                its language seemed certain to inhibit such a dialogue. It also
                                could not agree that a threat to the peace already existed. For text

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> presented a New York text
                            proposed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> as of Monday night. He said Governor <persName

                            revisions proposed by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>, the text was negotiable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then showed the President
                            Lord Home's personal letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> objecting to the Washington text worked out by the
                            United States and others on July 26. The President asked what
                            alternative the United Kingdom would propose. He noted that Home's
                            letter was very strong, deserving serious consideration, and that we
                            should listen to any British initiative. He noted also the United States
                            interest in British Guinea is vital, with reference to Lord Home's
                            comment on that country.</p>
                        <p>The President asked for comment on a proposal that we join with the
                            British in abstaining and permitting a Chapter 6 permissive resolution
                            to pass. If the alternative were to lobby for sufficient abstentions to
                            defeat a resolution which would be preferable? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> felt it would be better to
                            abstain passively and permit such a resolution to pass.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the President, who then left the room, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called Lord Home and agreed to
                            show Home a further revised version of the <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> text of this day.</p>

                            it was agreed to recommend to the President abstention, permitting a
                            resolution to pass if it were strictly Chapter 6 and permissive. It was
                            agreed that the President and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"

                                Security in Africa,” by a vote of 8 to 0, with 3 abstentions
                                (including the United States). The resolution urgently called upon
                                Portugal to recognize the right of the peoples of the Territories to
                                self-determination and independence, and requested that “all States
                                should refrain forthwith from offering the Portuguese Government any
                                assistance which would enable it to continue its repression of the
                                peoples of the Territories under its administration, and take all

                        <p>The President asked if he thought we could expect any new initiatives

                            territories. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there
                            was nothing significantly new apparent in his Lisbon talks but something
                            might come from further discussions scheduled with Nogueira here and

                        <p>The President raised the question of the Azores bases and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> suggested the Portuguese
                            want the continuation of the base as leverage on us on African problems.
                            The President agreed but observed that the problem was how far we can go
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and still hold the Azores.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked about the status of our arms embargo on the

                        <p>The Angolan rebellion is now entering the last half of its third year. It
                            has also entered a new psychological and political phase. This study
                            surveys not only the prospects for the nationalist movement, but its
                            policies and general orientation.</p>

                        <p>Militarily, the Angolan situation has changed little over the past year.
                            Rebels and Portuguese alike have followed a policy of entrenchment,
                            while concentrating on improved training for their respective <pb
                                n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0608"/>troops. A small group of rebels
                            (5,000-7,000 active fighters) prevents a large Portuguese force (42,000)
                            from completely pacifying the northwestern sector. The rebels plan new
                            assaults in the near future, perhaps over a slightly broader area.
                            However, they are incapable of seriously challenging Portugal's hold in
                            Angola—certainly not during the next year or two.</p>
                        <p>Politically, the rebellion has entered a new phase in which the
                            configuration of forces and opportunities is significantly altered. The
                            Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU1">OAU</gloss>) has
                            selected <persName corresp="#p_RH3">Holden Roberto</persName>'s
                            Government of the Republic of Angola in Exile (<gloss target="#t_GRAE1"
                                >GRAE</gloss>) as the sole legitimate nationalist agency. Eleven
                            governments have formally recognized the <gloss target="#t_GRAE1"
                                >GRAE</gloss>. It is now unlikely that African states would accept
                            any transitional arrangements in Angola that excluded the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Africans seek a political rather than a military victory in Angola.
                            However, Portugal is unlikely to agree to negotiation under terms
                            acceptable to Africans in the foreseeable future. Thus, with broad
                            African support, the <gloss target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss> will seek
                            during the coming year to secure a firmer military position. The
                            prospects increasingly are for a protracted struggle, a la Algeria.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss> now commands support from
                            tribal groups representing approximately 25 percent of the African
                            population of Angola. These groups are located in the northwestern
                            sector of the country. Faced with enormous obstacles to clandestine
                            organization, the political parties comprising the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss> nevertheless have attempted to extend
                            their influence beyond the northern tribal groups. Heretofore strongly
                            western-oriented, the <gloss target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss> is rapidly
                            assuming a more neutral position and may seek some Eastern European
                            assistance during the coming year—probably for tactical, rather than
                            ideological reasons.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GRAE1">GRAE</gloss>'s rising fortunes have been
                            reflected in the dramatic decline of the rival Popular Movement for the
                            Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA1">MPLA</gloss>). Once a
                            strong contender for pan-African support, the <gloss target="#t_MPLA1"

                        </list>
                        <p>The President inquired of the Foreign Minister how his talks with the
                            African group in New York were going. The Foreign Minister replied by
                            describing the disappointing communique issued by the African group the
                            previous evening in which the Africans rejected the resumption of the
                            talks except under new conditions which they laid down. Franco Nogueira
                            went on to say that the Portuguese had regarded the talks as falling
                            into three headings: (1) conditions in the Portuguese African
                            territories; (2) the threat to peace and security; and (3)
                            self-determination. The Africans had been interested only in discussing
                            self-determination. In order to cut through other discussion they had
                            been willing to concede that conditions were good in the Portuguese
                            territories and that there was no threat to peace and security. The
                            Foreign Minister said the Portuguese Government defined
                            self-determination in the same manner as did the United States
                            Government. If there were to be true self-determination all options
                            should be open including independence. Self-determination as defined by
                            the Africans is not self-determination at all as it is limited only to
                            independence. The African communique shows that the Africans do not
                            accept the U.S. and Portuguese definition of self-determination.</p>
                        <p>The President said that it is true that the Africans say
                            self-determination and independence. We always say self-determination.
                            We mean that all options are open.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister recounted a conversation he had had in New York with
                            the Guinean representative in which he had asked hypothetically if
                            Guinea would accept the results of a plebiscite in Portuguese territory,
                            even one supervised by Guinea, should the result opt for continued ties
                            with Portugal and against independence. The Guinean representative had
                            rejected this saying such a result could not be accepted. The President
                            asked why the Portuguese Government does not say publicly that it
                            accepts self-determination. They would be in a <pb n="582"
                                xml:id="pg_582" facs="0610"/>much more powerful position. The
                            Foreign Minister replied that they had said this in effect and that
                            their position is set forth in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Secretary General's report.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had seen a definition of self-determination
                            ascribed to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> as
                            meaning participation of the people in the administration and political
                            life of the community. Did this exclude opting for independence? The
                            Foreign Minister said it excludes nothing. An examination of Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName>'s statements will
                            reveal this.</p>
                        <p>The President asked where we disagree. The Foreign Minister said we agree
                            on the definition of self-determination but we do not agree on phasing.
                            He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> if this were
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that in
                            conversations he has had over the past months both with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAO1">Salazar</persName> and with the Foreign Minister
                            he believes we differ on our sense of timing. The U.S. feels that there
                            is a tidal wave moving in Africa, that time is telescoped and that there
                            is great urgency in timing. Ten years would be a maximum to bring about
                            conditions where the exercise of self-determination is possible. This
                            would include urgent programs of education and the creation of a
                            situation where the population could exercise the right of
                            self-determination. The real issue between the U.S. and Portugal is
                            timing.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said Portugal does not agree that a tidal wave is
                            moving in Africa. If it is doing so, Portugal believes this is only
                            because the U.S. supports it. More important, Portugal feels that once
                            you make a statement you unleash forces which cannot be controlled.
                            Political forces come to the top which cannot be managed. You start by
                            saying ten years and you end up with ten months. This is the great
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued saying Portugal has now reached a position
                            of political strength where even the Africans admit no war is going on
                            in the Portuguese territories. There is an economic boom in the
                            territories and a return of confidence. Portugal does not see why it
                            should be obliged to submit to the Africans under these conditions.</p>
                        <p>Franco Nogueira said another point arose in conversations he had the
                            previous day with the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName>. In private talks many of the African
                            representatives take moderate positions. They say individually that what
                            Portugal has said in New York about its policies should be enough to
                            satisfy the Africans for a long time. But when the African
                            representatives are together it is another story.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood. Groups are different than individuals.
                            In a group the most extreme becomes the common denominator.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister referred to a conversation he had in New York with
                            an African representative who personally opposed <persName>Ben
                                Bella</persName> and felt that <persName>Ben Bella</persName> was a
                            danger to Africa. He had told the Foreign Minister, however, that
                            publicly he was obliged to support <persName>Ben Bella</persName> and
                            was afraid not to do so.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>The President inquired as to the capability of guerrillas in the
                            Portuguese territories. The Foreign Minister said it was too costly for
                            the Algerians, for example, to send large numbers of guerrillas;
                            secondly the people of the Portuguese territories do not support the
                            guerrillas. Recently during the tour of the President of the Portuguese
                            Republic through the African territories there was not a single untoward
                            incident. The rebels have no support. There are many leaders in Angola
                            who support the Government. They see what is going on elsewhere in
                            Africa and especially in the Congo just across the border. They want to
                            retain the status quo in Angola and they so state to foreign ambassadors
                            and journalists who visit Angola from time to time. To answer the
                            President's question, the rebels do not have a very great strategic
                            capability. They are able to cause incidents but the security situation
                            in such South American countries as Colombia is worse today than is the
                            situation in Angola.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the President the Foreign Minister said
                            Portugal has about 40 to 50 thousand troops in Angola at the present
                            time. One third at any one time are on active duty in the north. The
                            remainder are resting or are on garrison duty.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister had asked African Delegates what else they had to
                            talk about at Addis Ababa after they had condemned Portugal and South
                            Africa. They had replied “nothing.” The Foreign Minister said Portugal
                            still feels that it is the underdog in world opinion. Predictions,
                            however, that Portugal would fall apart have not been fulfilled. He
                            might be accused of bias but in his opinion the situation was far more
                            encouraging than it was two or three years ago.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he was told by an old friend at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that many people were not happy with the
                            Portuguese talks with the Africans, that Portugal was not playing the
                            game. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> thrives on crises and
                            tensions, and the Portuguese talks with the Africans tended to reduce
                            tensions.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has a
                            special atmosphere. The Africans are becoming more extreme. The Foreign
                            Minister had mentioned an African representative who opposed
                                <persName>Ben Bella</persName> privately but felt obliged to follow
                            him. In the President's view that is what we are going to hear more of
                            in the future. The President asked what the Portuguese had said about
                            self-determination at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Franco
                            Nogueira said Portugal had outlined a certain concept which they had
                            said they were implementing. They had indicated precisely the steps
                            planned into 1964 but were unable to be exact as to timing beyond that.
                            These steps had included increased franchise, elections, etc. The
                            Portuguese had indicated two very important things: (1) a plebiscite;
                            and (2) the acceleration of plans for economic development and
                            education. The Foreign Minister said when you expand electoral roles and
                            step up economic development and education, isn't the result
                            self-determination? The Africans say <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584"
                                facs="0612"/>one man one vote. There is no point to this unless
                            there is a structure within which to operate. Such a structure comes
                            about only through economic and educational development. The population
                            then has a stake in the life of the community. At that point it should
                            then have a say in what happens to that community.</p>
                        <p>Franco Nogueira asked what is happening in some African countries where
                            one man one vote exists. The result in many cases is an authoritarian
                            regime where 99 percent of the vote is represented as being for the
                            winning candidate.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said the President would be amazed at what is said
                            about Portugal in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He, himself,
                            had been called the representative of a cannibal regime, for example.
                            These reports are printed at home in Portugal and cause strong adverse
                            public reaction to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There is
                            opposition in Portugal to doing anything which appears to be giving in
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He, himself, would be out of
                            office if he agreed to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> demands.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Foreign Minister had indicated he was happier
                            now about the situation in the African territories than a year ago. He
                            asked if in fact the situation were more secure. The Foreign Minister
                            said that short of an invasion by an army, the situation was secure and
                            under control. The population is not in favor of the rebels. The people
                            have a feeling of security again and have resumed building and
                            investing. There is no problem except in an area of Angola along the

                            Angola. The chief source of the trouble comes from approximately 200,000
                            members of the Bakong tribe who overlap from the Congo into Angolan
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> African
                            group will do. The Foreign Minister said he could not predict but there
                            will probably be a Security Council meeting, perhaps not soon but
                            eventually. The Africans will seek a resolution with strong measures
                            against Portugal. These could include sanctions or even expulsion from
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President said he did not
                            believe the Africans could expel Portugal but he thought they would
                            condemn the Portuguese. The Foreign Minister replied that Portugal has a
                            clear conscience and does not mind condemnation which really does not
                            amount to much. The U.S. bears a large responsibility in Security
                            Council matters and cannot escape this responsibility.<note n="1"

                                S/5481, “All Peoples Have the Right to Self-Determination,”
                                reaffirming previous U.N. resolutions on the Portuguese Territories
                                and calling upon all States to comply with the paragraph of the
                                Security Council Resolution of July 31 that was directed against the
                                provision of arms and military equipment to Portugal for use in its

                        <p>The President replied that this is true. The U.S. does have this burden.
                            That is why we interfere to the extent that we do in Portuguese affairs
                            because sooner or later Portuguese-African problems will come to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where we must take a position. We
                            have been attempting to find a way in which we can be more helpful to
                            Portugal than in the past. In view of the Foreign Minister's optimism
                            regarding the state of affairs in the Portuguese African territories and
                            the problems regarding timing, it is clear that we are not in complete
                            accord. The United States is in a different position than Portugal and
                            must therefore regard matters differently. We are not in entire
                            agreement with Portugal but he thought we would survive our
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>Franco Nogueira said if the Africans turned to the Soviets this would
                            place a great burden on the Soviets. He did not believe the Soviets were
                            prepared to take on the support of all of Africa. Secondly, the Soviets
                            are moving in other ways than the United States. The Soviets are doing
                            great work in secret subversion all over Africa. Houphouet-Boigny, the
                            President of the Ivory Coast, had told him about this. In the view of
                            Portugal, continued links between Africa and non-Communist European
                            nations gives stability to Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he was not saying that the U.S. was
                            responsible for events in Africa but the U.S. must bear some
                            responsibility because of the support it is giving to the trend of
                            events. Independ-ence in Africa has been achieved artificially and this
                            has created a fragile situation conducive to Communism.</p>
                        <p>Houphouet-Boigny had told him that most of the African leaders were very
                            young. What will happen to other young and ambitious Africans if the
                            present leaders stay in office twenty or thirty years? Ambitious new
                            comers find an outlet only through revolt. At this very moment there is
                            a plot in the Ivory Coast which Houphouet-Boigny knows about. The
                            Foreign Minister anticipated that we face a period of unrest ahead in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was glad to have this talk with the Foreign
                            Minister. There is likely to be a debate in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and a resolution. We will do the best we can to make the
                            resolution as restrained as possible. We will keep in close touch with
                            the Portuguese. The struggle is likely to be violent. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is becoming more extreme. Last year's
                            resolutions are not enough and there is a tendency to go to
                            extremes.</p>

                            which he had had with Mr. Hare, Deputy Under Secretary of State for
                            Political Affairs, concerning the proposed agreement with the Union of
                            South Africa for the establishment of a missile and space vehicle
                            tracking station near Pretoria.<note n="1" xml:id="d374fn1">In August

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> stated that Mr. Hare
                            indicated that the proposed agreement was under review by the Department
                            of State and the latter wished to know the importance which the
                            Department of Defense attached to the proposed agreement. This morning,
                            I spoke to General Yates who reaffirmed the long-range need for the
                            facilities as essential to the development of long range missiles and
                            space vehicle operations. General Yates also indicated his view that it
                            was important that we proceed to negotiate a permanent agreement with
                            the Union of South Africa as recommended by Ambassador Crowe. Following
                            my conversation with General Yates, I reaffirmed to Mr. Hare the need
                            for the facilities.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. Hare whether he would like a briefing by the Department of
                            Defense or a letter from the Department of Defense explaining its
                            continuing requirement for the facilities. Mr. Hare said that this would
                            not be necessary but suggested that I record the Defense view in a
                            Memorandum for the Record, a copy of which should be sent to him.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had endeavored to get in touch with the
                            Secretary even before he assumed office and wanted, in the course of
                            this conversation, to set forth some basic considerations upon which he
                            felt there should be an early exchange of views between his government
                            and the new Administration. He was afraid, he said, that if this kind of
                            heart-to-heart exchange did not take place, public positions might be
                            taken on each side which would greatly damage the chances of continuing
                            harmonious United States-South African relations. The Ambassador then
                            spoke for approximately twenty-five minutes from notes, a copy of which
                            he left with Mr. Penfield and which is attached hereto.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d375fn1">Attached to the source text but not printed.</note>
                            Acting on instructions, he also left an Aide-Memoire (copy attached).1
                            At the end of his presentation he made a fervent plea for American
                            understanding of the South African position and for recognition of the
                            principle that one cannot dogmatize about Africa. In this connection he
                            referred to the President's statement when commenting on Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>'s trip in Africa, that “Africa
                            is not simple.” He closed on a personal note of relative optimism by
                            saying that when his friends wrote from South Africa asking what he
                            thought of the chances for a better understanding with the United
                            States, he replied that he was very much impressed with the
                            “intellectual gift” around the President and that he thought this would
                            bring about a fair and reasonable view of South Africa.</p>
                        <p>In an indirect reference to the problem of the black, colored and Asian
                            urban populations, which the Ambassador had not mentioned in his
                            presentation, the Secretary asked whether the objectives of South
                            African policy could be brought about without the full cooperation of
                            everyone involved. The Ambassador replied evasively by referring to the
                            plans for gradual growth toward a commonwealth of independent countries
                            within the present borders of South Africa and the necessity of <pb
                                n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0616"/>white South Africans to

                            others.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the Ambassador's comment on how much the South African
                            Government is doing to educate its colored populations, the Secretary
                            asked whether this was not educating revolutionaries. In reply, the
                            Ambassador said that when he was participating in the conference to
                            organize FAO, an Asian delegate asked him “Why are you doing this; you
                            are preparing to feed us all and we will eventually eat you up.” The
                            Ambassador said that his reply was that this is perhaps true but there
                            are certain imperatives of civilization and ideals which must be
                            followed through regardless of the consequences.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the Secretary reassured the Ambassador that the United
                            States underestimates neither South Africa's contributions to the
                            Western world nor the difficulties of the problems which it faces, and
                            emphasized that our attitude would be based on the most full and careful
                            consideration of all the factors involved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Chet</hi>: As you requested, I have looked into
                            the necessity for concluding an agreement with the Union of South Africa
                            for the establishment in the Johannesburg/Pretoria area of a missile and
                            space vehicle tracking station extending the Atlantic Missile Range.</p>
                        <p>Many months ago it became clear that the full development of our national
                            missile and space vehicle capability would require the geographical
                            extension of our Atlantic Missile Range facilities into the general area
                            of southeastern Africa. Such facilities are required for the testing of
                            missiles at ranges over 5000 miles, and for tracking and telemetric data
                            acquisition in connection with test satellite launchings from Cape
                            Canaveral. These facilities would also be ideally located to support
                            certain test launchings in polar orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
                            California.</p>
                        <p>The use of instrumentation vessels in the area has been considered.
                            However, there is no reasonable prospect that such an unstable platform
                                <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0617"/>could provide the reliable
                            and accurate tracking capability which these development programs
                            demand. Further, a ship-based station could not possibly satisfy the
                            need for local airfields to support the specially-equipped aircraft
                            whose participation is also essential in the long-range missile
                            tests.</p>
                        <p>Possible sites for a land-based facility were discussed in great detail
                            with officials of the Department of State last Spring and Summer. A
                            number of alternatives to the Union of South Africa were examined, among
                            them Zanzibar, Mozambique, the Rhodesias, and Bechuanaland. Some of
                            these presented political difficulties quite as formidable as those in
                            the Union, plus serious technical and logistical difficulties which a
                            site in the Union would not involve. The Department of State therefore
                            agreed in July to sound out the South Africans. In August, given the
                            apparent readiness of the South Africans to cooperate on this defense
                            project despite our acknowledged differences over racial policy, the
                            Department of State agreed to go ahead with the station. While awaiting
                            the arrival of our proposals for a long-term agreement, the South
                            Africans have cooperated fully in occasional use of their airfields and
                            ports, and our use of a temporary site for certain portable tracking
                            equipment. The ultimate requirement, however, involves facilities and
                            activities which we could not reasonably expect to handle indefinitely
                            on an ad hoc and informal basis.</p>
                        <p>We in Defense do not see any effective alternative to a station in the
                            Union of South Africa if we are to handle the development of Transit,
                            Midas, Advent, Ranger, and other programs which will follow from the
                            availability of the Centaur/Atlas and Saturn boosters. A draft agreement
                            satisfactory to both State and Defense has been prepared. We believe
                            that this draft will be generally acceptable to the South Africans,
                            since it follows as closely as circumstances permit the recent
                            U.S.-South African agreement concerning the <gloss target="#t_NASA1"
                                >NASA</gloss> station at Pretoria. The latter agreement, which in
                            our view presented comparable questions of U.S. policy, was signed on
                            September 13, 1960.</p>
                        <p>We urge that in view of the foregoing the negotiating instructions which
                            are now being prepared in working level discussions in State and Defense
                            be forwarded to the Embassy in Capetown as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>The recent action of the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa in
                            withdrawing his country from the British Commonwealth and the recent
                            action of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on Angola have created
                            problems not anticipated in the outstanding national security policy
                            relating to Angola, the Union of South Africa, and the Portuguese
                            possessions in Africa.</p>
                        <p>The present situation appears to call for a review of the policy and the
                            development of such recommendations for change as you consider
                            appropriate under the new circumstances and in light of the probable
                            future developments. In this connection, it seems to me that we need to
                            have a particular look at the provisions with respect to the encouraging
                            of American private capital to seek investment outlets in South Africa
                            and with respect to the purchase of gold and other raw materials that
                            provide a major source of economic support for the South African
                                economy.<note n="1" xml:id="d377fn1">Documentation in Department of
                                State files indicates that Martin Herz of the Bureau of African

                                11-page Department of State paper, “Guidelines for U.S. Policy

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Chet</hi>: As a result of your letter of April

                                    >Gilpatric</persName> pointed out that the use of South African
                                territory for the U.S. missile tracking program posed serious
                                difficulties for the U.S. Government because of the racial policies
                                of the Union Government and the recurring controversies between that
                                government and the United Nations over South West Africa and
                                apartheid. Therefore, he argued, it was unwise for the United States
                                to enter into any long-term military agreement with South Africa for
                                a permanent tracking station, and asked the Department of Defense to
                                investigate other means of satisfying its requirements, such as the
                                use of instrumentation vessels. He also suggested waiting for the
                                views of the new U.S. Ambassador to South Africa before taking any
                                action on the proposed agreement. (Ibid.)</note> I asked the Deputy
                            Director of Defense Research and Engineering and the Under Secretary of
                            the Air Force personally to re-examine the need for a tracking station
                            in the Union of South Africa and possible alternatives to such a
                            station. This study has confirmed that tracking facilities in South
                            Africa or its vicinity will be needed for an extended period in support
                            of Midas, a program of very high national priority. Other important
                            satellite programs which require the support of the facilities are
                            Advent, Ranger, Vela Hotel, and Saint. In addition, the station will
                            provide extended range support for long-range ballistic missile tests of

                                <item>The use of shipborne tracking equipment is definitely not
                                    feasible because the three years required to provide this
                                    equipment would cause completely unacceptable delay in a program
                                    of highest national priority. Additional expenses of the order
                                    of $75 to $100 million would also result.</item>

                                <item>A station on land is necessary in an area, the center of which
                                    would be in the northeastern portion of the Union of South
                                    Africa and which would include the southern portions of
                                    Mozambique and Southern Rhodesia, the eastern portion of
                                    Bechuanaland and the enclaves of Swaziland and Basutoland. The
                                    limits of this area are dictated by the geometrical relations
                                    between satellite trajectories and the ground based instruments
                                    which collect tracking and telemetry data. Specifically,
                                    tracking and telemetry instrumentation at this location is
                                    essential to cover apogee and orbital injection events which
                                    occur over this area.</item>

                                    May of 1962 and an Advent shot in March 1962. Shots are
                                    projected thereafter for various programs through 1964, and the
                                    station would be of great importance in development programs to
                                    follow. The Midas shots must be supported by <pb n="592"
                                        xml:id="pg_592" facs="0620"/>tracking facilities in the area
                                    designated. Lack of data on more than one of these shots could
                                    cause unacceptable delay or damage to the program.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As a result of our review, it appears to us that an early decision must
                            be made—(a) to seek assurances of South African cooperation for
                            continued use and expansion of the present tracking facilities in that
                            country, or (b) to make firm arrangements to move the facilities to one
                            of the other above-mentioned countries in the area.</p>
                        <p>If the latter alternative were adopted, we would want agreement in
                            principle from the country concerned not later that July 1, 1961. This
                            data is dictated by the lead time involved in site surveys, site
                            preparation, and the installation and calibration of equipment. Even
                            with initial access by July 1, 1961, it would not be possible to track
                            the January 1962 Midas shot. Any later date would be unacceptable
                            because it would prevent the tracking of the March 1962 Midas and Advent
                            shots.</p>
                        <p>Even if a site outside of the Union of South Africa is selected for the
                            tracking facilities, we must preserve the good will of the Union to
                            assure the availability of its airfields and ports for the aircraft and
                            ships which must operate in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans if long
                            range missile tests are to be conducted effectively. Similarly, denial
                            of commercial (government or privately owned) communication,
                            transportation and other logistic support within the Union would
                            seriously impede the operation of alternate facilities in one of the
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>In view of the need for an early decision on this matter, we earnestly
                            hope that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName>'s appraisal of the situation will be
                            available soon, and that we can then give expeditious joint attention to
                            the course of action we should take. In the meantime, if you desire to
                            consider the technical details which support the conclusions set forth
                            above, we would be most happy to arrange for their presentation, at your

                            received me cordially this morning on my first protocol visit and
                            expressed desire establish friendly personal relations. With apologies
                            for being extremely busy before his departure for Pretoria for Republic
                            Day ceremonies<note n="1" xml:id="d379fn1">On May 31, the Union of South
                                Africa became the Republic of South Africa and severed its ties with
                                the British Commonwealth.</note> he said he would endeavor arrange
                            one or more long meetings with me soon after his return Capetown for
                            serious discussion our respective policies.</p>
                        <p>We did however engage in substantive conversation briefly. He expressed
                            belief we did not fully understand his government's position and its
                            importance to defense of African continent against Communist menace. I
                            said President has told me he was not sending me here to point finger at
                            his government but that latter must realize importance to us of our
                            relations with African, Asian and Latin American states who had very
                            strong feelings re South Africa's racial policies. We desired maintain
                            friendly relations with Union which we looked to as an old friend and
                            ally but unless his government could develop some flexibility and give
                            in its racial policy this would be very difficult. I wondered also
                            whether his government realized intensity of feeling on South Africa's
                            racial policy which was developing throughout world. He mentioned that
                            it did. While interview was most cordial throughout and he seemed
                            genuinely desirious of maintaining friendly relations with US which he
                            said he greatly admired, his general attitude and reaction tended
                            confirm prevailing impression that there is little likelihood of change
                            in <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> racial policy as long as he
                            remains Prime Minister.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="strong">Dear <persName corresp="#p_DSP1">Dean</persName></hi>:
                            I have recently heard about the proposed agreement with the Union of
                            South Africa for (a) a missile tracking station, and (b) a sale of arms
                            including fighter aircraft.</p>
                        <p>While I am not fully informed about the necessity for this transaction, I
                            am sufficiently concerned to presume to send you this note of caution.
                            At a time when the feeling about apartheid and the policy of the Union
                            of South Africa is rising everywhere, including pressure for sanctions
                            in the U.N., I would think that the necessity must be very compelling to
                            risk the repercussions from a transaction of this kind if and when it
                            becomes known, as it must inevitably. I hardly need add that relations
                            with the rest of Africa, and especially the new states, are important to
                            our security too.</p>

                                source text, but is not printed. On March 16, the United States
                                voted for U.N. General Assembly Resolution 1593 (XV), which appealed
                                to those U.N. members having particularly close and continuous
                                relations with the Government of South Africa to bring all their
                                influence to bear on that government with a view to ensuring that it
                                would live up to its U.N. Charter obligations and give effect to
                                previous U.N. General Assembly resolutions on South West Africa. On
                                April 7, the United States voted for Resolution 1596 (XV) which
                                noted with regret that the South African Government had refused to
                                cooperate with the U.N. Committee on South West Africa and requested
                                that the Committee proceed with its investigation—with or without
                                that government's cooperation.</note></p>
                        <p>Between now and the 16th General Assembly I believe we should instruct

                            approach the Republic Government to urge it to cooperate with the United

                            Africa. At a minimum, we feel that South Africa should resume reporting
                            on the territory in accordance with paragraph 6 of the Mandate
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Even though the International Court of Justice now has the case of South
                            West Africa, we may be faced with extreme resolutions in the 16th
                            General Assembly calling for diplomatic or economic sanctions,
                            divestiture of the Mandate or expulsion from the United Nations. We
                            believe it would be preferable to oppose such extreme resolutions (which
                            in any event may be illegal or unenforceable) and to await the judgment
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>. Then, if the Republic should
                            fail to abide by the Court's decision, the matter could be taken to the
                            Security Council, under Article 94 of the Charter.</p>

                        <p>In addition, the Air Force has raised with <gloss target="#t_ISA1"
                                >ISA</gloss> the desirability of inviting Mr. <persName

                            Test Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. They have suggested a visit on
                            or about the 14th of June because, if present schedules are maintained,
                            that period offers an excellent opportunity to witness missile
                            launchings. The Air Force would make appropriate arrangements for
                            transportation and accommodations.</p>
                        <p>We concur that such a visit could be valuable. It might give Mr.

                            operations and objectives of the Atlantic Missile Range, out of which
                            such problems as the South African tracking station have been generated.
                            If you agree, it is recommended that you extend the invitation. If Mr.

                            </list>
                            <p>The Union of South Africa possesses the most extensive and
                                well-equipped harbors in its part of the world. These ports have a
                                combined capacity to handle approximately 250 vessels, primarily at
                                Capetown and Durban. The facilities include adequate numbers of
                                powerful cranes and excellent floating and graving docks permitting
                                major repair and maintenance work on large ships. For example, the
                                largest graving dock in Capetown would handle the Forrestal class
                                carrier. The nearest adequate facilities are at Bahia Blanca,
                                Argentina, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but even these are not equal
                                in capacity to the facilities at Capetown alone.</p>
                            <p>The South African ports are used regularly by our naval and merchant
                                shipping in peacetime. In the event of emergency, their value would
                                be even greater. Closure of the Suez Canal would require extensive
                                    <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>use of the route around
                                the Cape of Good Hope. The ports would be then needed not only for
                                services to expanded merchant traffic on that route, but also for
                                support of the antisubmarine forces which might, depending upon the
                                nature of the emergency, be required to keep the route open.</p>
                            <p>The facilities would be needed also for support of any general naval
                                operations by a U.S. Indian Ocean Fleet, and would be important for
                                the staging of U.S. forces should contingency operations be
                                undertaken in the southern part of the African continent.</p>
                            <p>In addition, effective U.S. naval operations south of the equator
                                would require additional shore-based communications to supplement
                                our present facilities in Morocco and Ethiopia. In the
                                circumstances, we would have to rely on the use of South African
                                naval radio facilities at Durban and Simonstown.</p>
                            <p>For all the foregoing purposes, naval visits to the ports of the
                                Union of South Africa are most valuable for familiarization and
                                indoctrination purposes should the need for use of facilities become
                                more urgent.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ros</hi>: I am writing to confirm the
                            understanding which was reached at our meeting at the White House
                            yesterday regarding our future course of action on the missile tracking
                            station in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>We will instruct our Embassy in the Union of South Africa to negotiate a
                            two-year extension of existing arrangements in order to retain our
                            present missile tracking facilities there for that period of time. The
                            Navy on its part will undertake to develop seaborne missile tracking
                            facilities to take over the necessary functions upon the expiration of
                            the aforesaid arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the large aircraft order which the government of the Union of
                            South Africa wishes to place with Lockheed, I understand that <pb
                                n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0626"/>we all agreed that it will not
                            be possible under present circumstances for the U.S. Government to
                            authorize it. We will, however, try to avoid giving Lockheed a final
                            decision in this matter until our negotiations with South Africa for an
                            extension of existing arrangements on the missile tracking facilities
                            are complete.<note n="1" xml:id="d383fn1">On August 11, <persName

                                    >Satterthwaite</persName> for negotiating continued use of
                                tracking facilities in South Africa through 1963. He warned that the
                                approach had to be very carefully thought out so as not to create
                                undue resentment or suspicion concerning U.S. motives, and pointed
                                out that South Africans had been given to understand that the United
                                States wanted their cooperation for a much longer period. Gilpatric
                                stated that he had issued instructions concerning the development of
                                shipborne tracking capabilities for use after 1963, but reminded
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName> that it had been
                                previously estimated that it would take 3 years to develop this
                                capability. (Ibid.)</note></p>

                        <p>“Upon instruction from his Government Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> called on FonMin Louw to
                            discuss with him questions that had been <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599"
                                facs="0627"/>raised by Mr. Louw in his conversation with Ambassador
                            on June 30 as recorded in informal memorandum handed to Ambassador on
                            that occasion.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has carefully studied Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName>'s report of
                            this conversation as well as memorandum confirming frank observations
                            made by Mr. Louw. It wishes to respond with equal frankness to those
                            observations because it believes that relations between our two
                            countries should be based, above all, on a clear understanding of
                            respective viewpoints.</p>
                        <p>The US is mindful of long tradition of collaboration between our two
                            countries as exemplified by our brotherhood in arms during First and
                            Second World Wars, during Berlin blockade, and in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resistance against Communist aggression in Korea. US is
                            gratified to note that <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> still adheres
                            to convictions which led to these common actions, convictions to which
                            US continues to be devoted in equal measure. US also is mindful of
                            wholehearted cooperation it has received from <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                >SAG</gloss> in connection with US civilian and military space
                            vehicle and missile research programs, and others.</p>
                        <p>US however would be lacking in honesty and would be untrue to feelings of
                            friendship it holds for peoples of South Africa if it failed to state
                            its profound concern at evidence of increased racial tensions in South
                            Africa and in country's drift toward international isolation. US can
                            only view continuance of South Africa's official policy of apartheid in
                            terms of ultimate disaster to South Africa.</p>
                        <p>US would agree that there is much misunderstanding and misrepresentation
                            in world concerning South Africa's racial problem, and an unwillingness
                            to give credit for what is being done for benefit of Republic's
                            non-white population. There is no escaping fact however that most
                            nations of world, including many who wish to retain close friendship
                            with South Africa find themselves unable to accept a governmental policy
                            which compels and perpetuates a system which denies fundamental human
                            rights to vast majority of country's population only because of color of
                            their skin.</p>
                        <p>Position of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in this respect is
                            well-known to <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>. US had taken view
                            before Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> assumed his
                            duties as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs that
                            situation in South Africa ‘is one that has led to international friction
                            and if continued might endanger international peace and security' as
                            expressed in resolution of UNSC of April 1, 1960.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d384fn2">For text, see American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents, 1960, pp. 635-636.</note> US finds itself unable to agree
                            with <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>'s contention that Republic's
                            racial policy represents exclusively a domestic matter. In our view this
                            policy not only does violence to human rights provisions of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600"
                                facs="0628"/>but tends to weaken position of West in its efforts to
                            resist Communist influence and penetration in newly emerged Afro-Asian
                            nations, a matter in which <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> itself
                            has expressed deep concern. As a consequence US for its own and for
                            world security must continue its disapproval of a policy which arouses
                            emotions and resentments of such large segments of population of
                            world.</p>
                        <p>US regrets that press reports of statements by Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> have given
                            impression in some circles in South Africa that we regard white
                            population as being expendable and that we urge immediate and
                            unqualified granting of political power to vast non-white majority of
                            South African population. This certainly has never been and is not now
                            intention or desire of US. It is because US is thoroughly aware of great
                            complexity of problem and tremendous importance of white population to
                            future well-being of South Africa that it believes in a planned,
                            purposeful and progressive evolution of institutions that would
                            safeguard basic rights of all elements of South Africa's population.</p>
                        <p>US is deeply concerned over ever-widening chasm between whites and
                            non-whites in South Africa and evidence that non-white moderation is
                            being supplanted by non-white extremism which can only endanger future
                            stability of country. US therefore would warmly welcome the beginnings
                            of any steps which <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> could take to
                            permit non-whites to play a greater role in life of their country and
                            which would be apt to remove some of opprobrium which attaches to South
                            Africa not only in eyes of colored people of world but also in eyes of
                            people of most white nations. Should such steps be taken with view to
                            ultimate full participation US would gladly cooperate to fullest extent
                            possible with South Africa in all fields of endeavor to mutual benefit
                            of both countries and to Free World generally. In absence of such
                            indications of change however US could not be expected to cooperate in
                            matters which it believed would lend support to South Africa's present
                            racial policies.</p>
                        <p>On other hand <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> agrees with Mr. Louw's
                            view which we believe is shared by <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                            that there are numerous fields in which our two countries can continue
                            to collaborate closely and fruitfully to our mutual benefit and for good
                            of Free World especially in areas of common defense against threats
                            emanating from Communist Bloc. Mention might also be made of our
                            continued desire to cooperate in fields of missile activity and space
                            exploration, atomic energy and in entire range of scientific, technical
                            and research activities. Furthermore <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            believes it desirable to maintain and strengthen mutually desirable
                            cooperation and exchanges which have existed in cultural, educational,
                            health and welfare and other fields. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            is confident now that divergent views of both Governments have been made
                            clear that relations between our two countries will continue to be
                            characterized by frankness, sincerity and mutual trust as in past.” <hi

                        <p>State and Defense have agreed on desirability negotiating with <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> for continued use and planned expansion
                            of <gloss target="#t_AMR1">AMR</gloss> tracking facilities, at least
                            through 1963.</p>
                        <p>Department has received impression that until US policy towards Republic
                            clarified we cannot expect their cooperation on matters of interest to
                            us. Situation may have changed since July 1 however and Ambassador may
                            feel it desirable to advise <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_SAAF1">SAAF</gloss> informally of US desire
                            discuss tracking station arrangements even before presentation of
                            aide-memoire, particularly if it appears appointment with FonMin will be
                            delayed. As Embassy is aware <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> would
                            like to let contracts within next few weeks for construction necessary
                            to install Phase 2 equipment which should be operational in January.
                            Department's hope is that <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>'s reaction
                            to aide-memoire will be reasonably favorable and that Ambassador can
                            indicate at same time or shortly thereafter US desire discuss tracking

                            essence, he interpreted our policy as one in which we would <pb n="602"
                                xml:id="pg_602" facs="0630"/>cooperate with the Federation only in
                            matters of benefit to the U.S., such as the missile and satellite
                            tracking facilities. On other matters we would not only not cooperate
                            with South Africa, but would oppose it, until it changes its apartheid
                            policy. In Louw's view, the U.S. appears to want “to have its cake and
                            eat it too.”</p>
                        <p>There are two matters of immediate interest to South Africa which, if the
                            U.S. fails to cooperate, would most likely mean the end of South African
                            assistance with respect to our missile and satellite tracking activities
                            there. The first concerns the possibility of South Africa seeking a
                            second drawdown of <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> funds. According
                            to Louw, South Africa hoped not to have to make this second drawing, but
                            would seek it if necessary to strengthen the economy of the country and
                            further to improve the welfare of the Bantu. Louw, however, had heard
                            that the U.S. intends to oppose the second drawdown and indicated that,
                            if this were so, it was a most serious matter in our relationship. The
                            second matter concerns the recent formal request by the South African
                            Embassy here for approval of the sale of seven C-130 aircraft by
                            Lockheed. It is Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName>'s view that refusal of the sale may
                            foreclose any further South African cooperation in the field of mutual
                            defense and make it impossible to negotiate arrangements for the
                            continued use of the tracking facilities.</p>
                        <p>We understand that the State Department is seeking Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s approval of a reply to the South
                            African Embassy which would deny its request for the sale of the seven
                            C-130s. I strongly recommend that you call Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> personally, asking him to hold up
                            action on this until our two Departments can review thoroughly the South
                            African response to the U.S. aide-memoire and its implications
                            concerning future South African cooperation in the field of mutual
                            defense. In this regard, Foreign Minister Louw will attend the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly next week and is
                            scheduled to meet with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName>. I further recommend that you arrange a meeting
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> before then to
                            discuss these problems with him.</p>
                        <p>If Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> should indicate
                            that it had previously been agreed between State and Defense that the
                            sale of aircraft to South Africa should not be authorized, you may wish
                            to point out that this was done in the context of South African desires
                            for F-104s as well as C-130s and with the anticipation that this could
                            be accomplished without jeopardizing arrangements for the tracking
                            facilities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="strong">Dear Mac</hi>: We are now facing a difficult situation
                            in regard to the Republic of South Africa on which I would appreciate
                            your assistance. As you know, the Republic's apartheid policy has made
                            it a primary target of the Asian and African bloc; indeed, of a large
                            segment of opinion in the United States and Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>If we were free agents, our voting position in the United Nations on the
                            Republic and our policies in regard to this government would be designed
                            to encourage a change in the basic attitudes, and in the interval to
                            express our strong disapproval.</p>
                        <p>However, a year ago we agreed with the Pentagon to negotiate for the
                            establishment of the tracking station in South Africa for which an
                            initial agreement runs out on December 31st; as a result we are under
                            direct and indirect pressure to make concessions to this government
                            which are bound to be costly to us in the United Nations and in our
                            relations with the world generally.</p>
                        <p>At present, I can think of five points which bear upon this problem.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p>Naval maneuvers involving a few American warships with
                                    additional vessels from the South African and British navies,
                                    and with Portuguese observers, are scheduled for late October
                                    and early November. This is a continuation of maneuvers held in
                                    1959 and 1960.</p>
                                <p>If it were not for the leverage provided to the South African
                                    government by the tracking station, I do not think we would
                                    consider participating in these maneuvers. Their military
                                    importance can be no more than marginal to us. However, for
                                    South Africa the advantage is very real in that this can be used
                                    to indicate that this Republic is an “ally” of the United
                                    States. The impact in the United Nations when reports of these
                                    maneuvers appear in late October should be carefully
                                    weighed.</p></item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item><p>South Africa is considering the purchase of $100 million worth
                                    of airplanes from a U.S. corporation. Although the transaction
                                    would be for dollars, it requires licenses from us.</p>
                                <p>If it were not for the tracking station, our reaction would
                                    certainly be negative in view of the fact that public opinion
                                    generally would assume that the primary use of these planes
                                    would be to suppress internal disorder.</p>
                                <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0632"/>
                                <p>There is now a fair possibility that South Africa may decide to
                                    buy the planes in France so our present position is to
                                    stall.</p></item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>South Africa has requested $75 million from the International
                                Monetary Fund. Although we have no veto power over such a
                                transaction, our position as a principal contributor is of great
                                importance. We have agreed to the sum of $37.5 million because to
                                refuse to do so would be to break all kinds of precedents. Once
                                again, however, if it were not for the tracking station we would
                                under no circumstances agree to the additional $37.5 million which
                                in the eyes of the world will be connected with the purchase of the
                                airplanes.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The Republic of South Africa is urgently calling on us for support
                                for its membership on the United Nations Outer Space Committee.
                                Although they do not have a chance of being elected even with all
                                the influence we can bring to bear, it would be difficult for us
                                under present circumstances to refuse to make this effort. Yet if we
                                do so we will be taking one more step toward allying ourselves with
                                what is perhaps the most unpopular nation outside the Communist
                                world.</item>

                            <item>When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                    >Satterthwaite</persName> went to Africa, we instructed him to
                                invite black Africans to private and public receptions at his home.
                                We did this knowing that such action would undoubtedly be subjected
                                to criticism by the local government, criticism which we were fully
                                prepared to meet, if necessary leaving our Embassy under the
                                supervision of a Charge.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> has had
                            black Africans to his home privately. But because of our desire not to
                            upset the government in view of pending negotiations for the tracking
                            station, he has not invited black Africans to his public receptions.</p>
                        <p>If we are forced to take these actions, most of which will become known
                            to the public in the midst of a highly explosive United Nations session
                            in which the attitudes of the Asians and Africans will be of decisive
                            importance, we will probably have to pay a heavy political price.</p>
                        <p>I have great sympathy with the Pentagon's problem and I have no desire to
                            make this situation more difficult. However, when the agreement was
                            reached a year ago in an exchange of letters between State and Defense
                            in August and September of 1960, it was agreed that “the (tracking)
                            station would be removed if, due to later political developments in the
                            African area, it should become a net disadvantage to United States
                            interests.”</p>
                        <p>The Pentagon now apparently feels that the tracking station is of such
                            great military importance that we have no alternative but to bargain out
                            the situation as best we can.</p>
                        <p>Because of the basic importance of this question to our political
                            position not only in the Republic of South Africa but in Africa as a
                            whole, I would be grateful if Jerry Wiesner or some other outside
                            authority in the <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0633"/>scientific
                            field could examine the possible alternatives and perhaps bring a fresh
                            mind to bear on the problem.</p>
                        <p>If such a study accepts the view that this tracking station is of primary
                            vital importance to our defense effort and if no other alternative is
                            available, then I suppose we shall have to do the best we can.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this matter with Ros Gilpatric, and he has agreed that
                            we should hold up decisions on the question of maneuvers for a few days.
                            He also agrees that it would be a good idea if Jerry Wiesner, or some
                            other competent outside scientific authority, reviewed the entire matter
                            of our tracking stations.<note n="1" xml:id="d386fn1">See <ref

                        <p>This is a difficult situation with foreseeable political consequences,
                            and I hate to see us take the final plunge without making every effort
                            to try to find a way out of the dilemma.</p>
                        <p>With my warmest regards,</p>

                                review by Jerry Wiesner. Wiesner's review is now at hand, and in

                            McMillan, and to Ros Gilpatric.</p>
                        <p>The following are the facts: The South African station is used for
                            receiving telemetering data to provide diagnostic information in the
                            event of failure in certain of our satellite tests. At the present time
                            the only programs involved are the Midas Ballistic Missile Warning
                            Satellite and the Advent Communications Satellite. Both of these are
                            research programs of importance, but are not among the highest priority
                            Defense Department space programs. If we were forced out of the Union of
                            South Africa, we would have to operate without this particular
                            diagnostic data until either we get another land-based site (the Air
                            Force is seeking a new site, but we shouldn't count on their finding
                            one), or we are able to prepare a tracking ship to substitute for the
                            land-based station. The Air Force estimates that this could not be done
                            until late fall of 1962 at the earliest.</p>
                        <p>However, since the test programs could be carried on, albeit some-what
                            less effectively, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> has agreed to the position that loss of this
                            site would be painful, but not fatal, and therefore we should advise the
                            State Department to proceed in the following manner: neither be
                            deliberately provocative and thus insure that we will be ordered out,
                            nor permit the need for the site to be the reason for compromise on
                            issues which the State Department regards as fundamental in the conduct
                            of its foreign policy.</p>

                            with installation of programmed equipment as already informally

                            foregoing, you should point out US space program requirements under

                            programs and requirements for supporting them are subject to substantial
                            change from year to year. For this reason US believes most satisfactory
                            arrangement would be continuation of present flexible informal
                            undertakings by new exchange of letters. You should also state <gloss

                            delay to South Africans you may wish point out well known fact new
                            administration undertook very thorough extensive review of national

                            As indicated above, results this review show desirability of continuing
                            flexible arrangements of present type of South Africa, subject

                            Africa. Conclusion is that loss this station would be “painful but not
                            fatal.” Conclusion also supports Department's attitude on which
                            State-Defense understanding exists that we will not alter our basic
                            national policy toward South Africa including our opposition to
                            apartheid in order to retain station. Alternatives to South African
                            station would require at best six months to two years to make ready. It

                        <p>Louw stated South Africa's position international issues clearly on side
                            West, anti-Communist, and <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> support
                            could be depended on any future world conflict. However, South Africa
                            unclear where other Western countries stand in relation South Africa. At
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> his delegation not taken into
                            confidence of West and therefore resented being asked how they will vote
                            on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> matters just before vote taken.
                            Ambassador Naude interjected at this point to say day to day contacts
                            with West at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> quite satisfactory but
                            would prefer systematized arrangement. As further example isolation Louw
                            said he not informed US and Western views Berlin issue. Secretary
                            thereupon informed Louw frankly and at length US policy on Berlin,
                            position principal allies, Soviet objectives and our estimate long-range
                            outlook for reunification Germany.</p>
                        <p>Louw said his government disturbed by US aide-memoire September 5
                            especially what he regarded as our policy of “divided cooperation.”
                            Indicated not satisfied so far with US explanation this policy which
                            seemingly based on premise US cannot cooperate with South Africa because
                            it denying human rights. Such conception apparently based
                            misapprehension conditions South Africa and reasons for its policy.
                            Wrong describe South Africa's policy “separate development” as denial
                            human rights since this policy necessary to ensure most fundamental
                            human rights of survival to which South Africa's whites entitled.</p>
                        <p>Louw said objective observer in South Africa would see Bantu developing
                            own independent political and social system. South African white knows
                            we can't transplant white man's system government on Bantu. Therefore

                            systems on ethnic basis to preserve own cultural values. He noted
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> in
                            discussion with him had noted “job reservation” as one example denial
                            human rights. FonMin said this not case, that reserving certain jobs for
                            whites and blacks related to question “survival” and was also means
                            protecting whites and blacks against Coloreds.</p>

                        <p>Louw summarized by saying despite our misapprehensions and despite our
                            criticism and opprobrium toward his government on race policy, South
                            Africa has cooperated and continues cooperate with US in providing
                            missile tracking stations and military facilities, her ports and
                            airfields on highly confidential matters often on short notice. Now he
                            wanted know how <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> intended cooperate
                            with <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary stated he would like see total US-<gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss> cooperation in this troubled world. However, we cannot
                            as nation and people with our history accept apartheid policy. This a
                            major moral issue which affects our relations with other countries and
                            we have chosen take our stand forthrightly in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> in accordance with our beliefs and conscience. Despite
                            this we have for considerable period attempted to act as moderator in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on items involving <gloss
                                target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> and this role quite frankly has been an
                            increasing burden to us. We sincerely hope <gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss> can find ways improve her position in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> these matters and give opportunity for
                            wisdom and time to moderate these issues. Secretary observed that all of
                            us in West presently faced historical problem of coming into some
                            reasonable relationship with non-white world. In this connection he
                            expressed to Louw concern that our Embassy in <gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss> cannot have normal relationship with population that
                            prevails all other countries. Louw responded if Secretary meant that
                            Embassy cannot have Bantu at its receptions that he would always oppose
                            any change in this policy since it would mean for <gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss> accepting social integration and the end of <gloss
                                target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> Race Pride to which it had a right.
                            Secretary summarized by stating that while US and <gloss target="#t_SA1"
                                >SA</gloss> cannot agree on matter race relations he saw no need why
                            this disagreement should infect total range our relations.</p>
                        <p>Louw complained failure US Delegate support his right free speech in
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> debate rather than in statement
                            issued after session adjourned and observed that seemed to him US
                            fearful antagonizing African members <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            Secretary replied principal US delegate unable attend session in
                            question and issued statement as soon as he learned what had taken
                            place. Secretary told Louw he could not accept inference that US
                            positions based on fear other nations rather than on our best judgment
                            what would be in best interests free world. Louw said he wished retract
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>Call ended on cordial note Louw stating he expected be in attend-ance at

                        <p>A congratulatory message from the President will be a source of
                            encouragement to him and all opponents of apartheid, and will be
                            beneficial to us in the over-all African context. The Government of
                            South Africa will, of course, be greatly displeased. However, such a
                            message falls clearly within the strong position this Government has
                            taken on apartheid, and there will be important segments of the South
                            African white population and the press who will understand and applaud
                            our move.</p>

                        <p>Sir Algernon Rumbold opened the discussion and stated that his remarks
                            would be grouped under three main headings: (1) Speculation about the
                            future of the Republic, (2) Negotiations to bring <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>-South African relations up-to-date following the
                            latter's withdrawal from the Commonwealth and (3) Pressures for
                            sanctions against the Republic.</p>
                        <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0642"/>
                        <p>Under heading (1) Sir Algernon commented that there would be no change in
                            the South African Government's policies without a change in the
                            government itself and there was no chance of this taking place. The
                            Afrikaners were tough, stubborn, in-bred people and pressure from
                            outside would simply drive them further into “laager.” Internal pressure
                            was ineffective and if the African people tried to overthrow the
                            government by force they would be massacred. Suggestions about an
                            effective African general strike were pointless since the African people
                            could not afford to keep it up long enough to do any good. The doctrine
                            of “apartheid” was nothing new in South Africa and was deeply ingrained
                            in the backgrounds of all people, black and white, in the Republic. What
                            liberal elements there were came mainly from the English speaking group
                            sprinkled with a few Afrikaner intellectuals.</p>
                        <p>Sir Algernon continued by stating that the British Government [<hi
                                rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] saw no
                            possibility of multi-racial sharing such as was being tried in the
                            Federation.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s major concerns in this area were:
                            (1) the dependence of the High Commission Territories on the Republic
                            and the ease with which the Republic could squeeze these territories if
                            it chose to do so, (2) the safety of the sea routes, the Simonstown
                            base, flying rights and other Defense arrangements, (3) the #900 million
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> investment in the Republic, (4)
                            the fact that 5% of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s total
                            exports were bought by the Republic and (5) the importance of gold
                            production to the Sterling area.</p>
                        <p>Turning to current negotiations with the Republic (heading 2), Sir
                            Algernon explained that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s over-all
                            objective was to cease treating the Republic as a member of the
                            Commonwealth but to arrange means to treat it as a friendly country and
                            protect the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> interests just mentioned.
                            He referred to the present “stand fast” law, which will expire on May
                            31, 1962, and spoke of the complicated new legislation which was
                            required. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, he said, hoped to
                            complete its negotiations with the Republic on this matter before
                            Christmas but the South Africans were very slow. Among the problems
                            which had been or were being discussed were: (1) The Nationality
                            Problem—The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not apply the Irish
                            formula. South Africans would be aliens but certain South Africans would
                            have the right to register as British up to 1965. Special provisions
                            would be made for the High Commission territories and free movement
                            between them and the Republic would continue. (2) Customs—The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wanted the customs agreement between the
                            H.C. territories and the Republic to continue. (3) Extradition Problems.
                            (4) Defense—The Simonstown base would continue, there would be
                            provisions for the defense of the sea routes and for flying rights and,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would provide certain types of
                            military equipment and military training (but not anti-riot equipment or
                            training). (5) Sterling Area—The Republic would stay in. (6)
                            Commonwealth <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0643"/>Preference—It
                            would continue. (7) Sugar Agreement—It had been completed.</p>
                        <p>Sir Algernon stated that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believed
                            sanctions against the South African Republic would be
                            counter-productive. Therefore, he said, the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> would not apply sanctions, would not support a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move to do so and certainly would not
                            sever diplomatic relations. The African people, Sir Algernon said, would
                            be the first to suffer from sanctions and the people in the High
                            Commission territories would be adversely affected. Imposing sanctions
                            would create an awkward precedent. Who would be next? The <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not wish to prejudice her interests
                            in the Republic. Furthermore, sanctions would tend to force the present
                            opposition into alignment with the Nationalist Government since no South
                            African could approve a move designed to harm the economy. Finally, Sir
                            Algernon said he doubted whether sanctions would be effective in view of
                            the basic strength of the South African economy.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName>
                            responded stating that the U.S. did not have such important interests in
                            South Africa as the British. He noted U.S. investment, the tracking
                            station and the U.S. Navy's anti-submarine interests but said that the
                            U.S. was unwilling to compromise its principles to maintain those
                            interests. Therefore, the U.S. was relatively free in South Africa as
                            compared, for example, with Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Assistant Secretary said that U.S. policy towards the Republic was
                            based on three factors:—(1) South Africa's economy could make great
                            contributions to Africans and to the rest of the African continent.
                            Accordingly, the U.S. hated to see it destroyed. (2) The U.S. and the
                            Republic shared a common western heritage, had been comrades in arms in
                            two world wars and in Korea and were both unquestionably anti-communist.
                            (3) Apartheid, however, was obnoxious. It created a breeding ground for
                            communism and made U.S. relations with the rest of the African continent
                            very difficult. Therefore, U.S. policy was to “rifle in” on the aspects
                            of South Africa we did not like but support those aspects we did like.
                            We had conveyed this policy in an Aide-Memoire to the Republic but it
                            had been viewed as a serious impediment to the maintenance of friendly
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Examples of our policy in action were:—(1) <hi rend="italic">The Aircraft
                                Sale</hi>—They wanted fighters and transports but we approved only
                            transports. (2) <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                    >IMF</gloss> Loan</hi>—We had scrutinized this closely but had
                            approved the first tranche since first tranche approvals were
                            traditionally granted by the Fund. (3) The Tracking Station—We were
                            going ahead with this but we would not sacrifice our policies or our
                            freedom of action to get it.</p>

                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> said
                            the U.S. might<note n="1" xml:id="d393fn1">At this point in the source
                                text the word “would” is crossed out and replaced with a handwritten

                            would help the U.S. position with the rest of Africa. He commented that
                            the U.S. had opposed sanctions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            and might continue to do so. The U.S. wanted to “zero in” on the real
                            targets but, at the same time, it did not want to force the Republic
                            into “laager.” The U.S. recognized that South Africans were tough and
                            wanted to show them it was just as tough.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the discussion which followed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName> advanced the view that the West
                            African nations would attack the U.S. and the U.K. for an “easy” South
                            African policy and would turn to the Soviet Union. Sir Roger Stevens
                            replied that this was a problem but he believed it could be met. He said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not believe its South
                            African policy would seriously damage the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>'s relations with other African nations. He felt that the
                            other nations appreciated that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was
                            a large trading partner with the Republic and pointed out that India had
                            opposed sanctions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> too. Sir
                            Roger warned that the question of how apartheid was attacked was crucial
                            and stated, “you must be careful you don't do more harm than good.”</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> reiterated that
                            the U.S. believed it was necessary to do something about apartheid and
                            expressed the belief that the time of the Europeans in South Africa was
                            limited. Sir Roger and Sir Algernon replied that if this were true there
                            were only two possible results. Either a “bloody revolution,” which
                            would be a “terrible mess,” or a gradual “leavening of the lump” on the
                            race question. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> believed that the
                            latter was the best hope. Sir Roger added that the U.S. would bear a
                            very grave responsibility if it gave any encouragement to Africans to
                            attempt to overthrow the South African Government.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> asked whether
                            sabotage of the Republic's gold mines would not cripple the economy. The
                            British delegation replied that the situation in the mines was quite
                            good and there was no history of disorders in this sector. However,
                            there were undoubted economic weaknesses in apartheid and the Bantustan
                            border development plan was described as “just talk.”</p>
                        <p>At the close of the meeting Governor Williams stated that the U.S. wanted
                            to be sure that U.S. inter-racial policies were reflected in its
                            operations overseas. Accordingly, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJC1"
                                >Satterthwaite</persName> had been instructed to hold inter-racial
                            dinners and improve contacts with non-Europeans. Sir Roger commented, “I
                            presume the U.S. does not want to provoke a break in diplomatic
                            relations with South Africa.” Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> replied that the U.S. wanted to maintain
                            diplomatic relations as long as relations were meaningful but it would
                            run the risk of a break if its operations were restricted.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked
                            Ambassador Naude regarding the size of population of South West Africa
                            and was told it was about one-half million persons. On being asked what
                            the attitude was towards their present associations with South Africa,
                            Ambassador Naude remarked that a plebiscite had been held in 1946 which
                            indicated that the majority wished to continue their association with
                            South Africa. The South African Ambassador then reminded Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> that, at Versailles, Smuts had
                            pressed hard for the mandate system for places such as Iraq where
                            eventual independence could be envisioned. However, some places in <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0648"/>the world were of such a nature
                            that they had to be regarded as an integral part of the mandating
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> confirmed his knowledge of
                            these “C” mandates, and asked the Ambassador what he felt was the
                            attitude of the inhabitants of South West Africa towards South Africa at
                            the present time.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he did not feel he could express himself on this
                            topic. He stated that some of the inhabitants of South West Africa are
                            not happy with the present situation, but he felt that the so-called
                            “representatives of the people of South Africa” did not represent the
                            thinking of the majority of the people of that area when they testified
                            at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. One South West African who was
                            at New York three years ago was now completely discredited by his own
                            people, and had gone to live in Scandinavia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then asked the
                            Ambassador why, if his Government really had confidence in the attitude
                            towards it of the people of South West Africa, they did not “nail down”
                            the fact that those Africans were pleased with their present
                            relationship to South Africa.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Nujoma opened the conversation by describing the recent <gloss

                                n="1" xml:id="d398fn1">On November 19, by a vote of 96 (including
                                the United States) to 0 with 1 abstention, the Trusteeship and
                                Non-Self-Governing Territories (Fourth) Committee adopted a draft
                                resolution on South West Africa that reaffirmed the inalienable
                                right of the people of South West Africa to independence and
                                national sovereignty, condemned the continued refusal of the South
                                African Government to cooperate with previous U.N. resolutions on
                                South West Africa, requested the Secretary-General to appoint a
                                Technical Assistance Resident Representative for South West Africa
                                and to take all necessary steps to establish an effective U.N.
                                presence in South West Africa, and urged all member states to
                                refrain from any action likely to hinder the implementation of
                                present and previous U.N. resolutions on South West Africa.</note>
                            as being very good, but in view of South <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623"
                                facs="0651"/>Africa's defiance of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> he wondered how it could be implemented. He suggested
                            that the US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could use
                            influence on South Africa and this would lead the territory to
                            independence. This point was made several times during the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName> asked him what are the
                            South African Government's objectives in South West Africa and whether
                            the Bantustan policy would be applied. Mr. Nujoma responded that the
                            South African Government wants to incorporate the territory into the
                            Republic, and that the Territory's Africans have opposed the Bantustan
                            policy as they have opposed partition. He recalled that the 1958 <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Good Offices Committee suggested
                            partition with South Africa continuing to administer the Northern
                            Territories. This would provide South Africa with a supply of labor, and
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO1">SWAPO</gloss> has fought this.</p>
                        <p>Turning to another point, Mr. Kuhangua said that <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO1">SWAPO</gloss> is thankful for what the US has
                            done—support for all the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions,
                            offers of scholarships, and a commitment to the International Court
                            case. However, more than voting is required; we should seek to implement
                            the resolutions. <gloss target="#t_SWAPO1">SWAPO</gloss> wants the US to
                            help the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuhangua referred to the need for the United States to establish a
                            consulate in Bechuanaland, or if possible in South West Africa, in order
                            to assist South West African students stranded in the High Commission
                            Territories and to serve as a listening post. The recent <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution called for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Specialized Agencies to operate in the
                            Territory. Mr. Kuhangua asked if it would be possible to send in the
                            Peace Corps. There are many ways the US can act. The Episcopal Bishop of
                            Damaraland, an American, is very sympathetic and US financial assistance
                            could be given to him to expand his educational, health, and other
                            social services.</p>
                        <p>Later in the conversation Mr. Kuhangua pointed to <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> action in Mississippi. He said we have an obligation in
                            South Africa and a great role to play there, for South African policy is
                            an insult to the world. Mr. Mathews replied that it is one thing to
                            persuade and another to be persuaded. The <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> position is perfectly clear. How effective this will be
                            is hard to say. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THJ1">Tasca</persName> added
                            that the International Court case will be very important for the South
                            Africans can be very stubborn. Our real hope is in building up public
                            opinion in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kuhangua commented that some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members mistakenly feel that political action is proscribed by the court
                            case. That case is a clear attack against apartheid. The South African
                            Government will be reluctant to become involved in a war unless South
                            Africa is attacked. While <gloss target="#t_SWAPO1">SWAPO</gloss>
                            opposes violence, there may be no other alternative solution.</p>
                        <p>Later, at the end of conversation, Mr. Nujoma reiterated his pleas for US
                            support saying that the situation is explosive. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW4">Fredericks</persName> replied that we are trying
                            to use our powers of persuasion at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            and in talks <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0652"/>with South Africa
                            officials. In Mississippi we acted to deal with our own problems. We
                            hope that other countries will see this resolve. While we can take such
                            steps in our own country, we are not free to do so elsewhere. We are
                            agreed on the nature of the problem in South Africa, the question is how
                            to determine steps that will be persuasive enough. Mr. Campbell said a
                            very real effort of persuasion is being made, but he was not sure much
                            has been accomplished. In this regard Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FJW4"
                                >Fredericks</persName> said he had talked to a great number of
                            visitors. Our approaches were not simply to officialdom. One is never
                            sure of the results of these talks. He did not want to give any idea of
                            optimism, simply that we are trying.<note n="2" xml:id="d398fn2">On

                        </list>
                        <p>The South African Naval Chief of Staff urgently asked our Naval Attache
                            in Pretoria to ascertain informally whether the US Government would be
                            willing to entertain a request to permit the purchase of two or three
                            modern conventional attack submarines of about 1700 tons, and would
                            provide crew training for key personnel. Our Ambassador notes that our
                            present policy with respect to South Africa, of which they have been
                            advised, permits the sale of military equipment for external defense,
                            and that this request could be given favorable consideration provided
                            submarines were available.</p>
                        <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0656"/>
                        <p>Submarines of this class are understood to cost approximately $40 million
                            each. They would have to come from new construction, and there would be
                            a three-year lead time from acceptance of order to delivery.</p>
                        <p>There are both benefits and difficulties inherent in this South African
                            request. An affirmative reply to South Africa would aid in maintaining
                            good military relations, this being of evident consequence in the light
                            of the importance to us of various US military facilities and rights in
                            the country, particularly tracking stations for Atlantic Missile Range
                            operations, port facilities, and overflight rights. In the event the
                            Suez Canal is closed to us, the Navy believes South African harbor and
                            dock facilities are virtually irreplaceable. It is doubtful these
                            strategic interests will be materially changed within the period in
                            which the submarines would be delivered to South Africa.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the prospect of growing racial conflict in South
                            Africa and of intensified international condemnation of the South
                            African Government will make significant US arms deliveries to that
                            country increasingly costly to us in political terms. Our efforts to
                            encourage a moderate African approach to the problems of Southern
                            Rhodesia and Portuguese Africa will be made more difficult. Furthermore,
                            if South Africa's international position continues to deteriorate, it is
                            probable that delivery of US submarines in 1966 could have highly
                            unfavorable repercussions abroad and at home.</p>
                        <p>On balance, however, in terms of our political relations with South
                            Africa and potential benefits to our balance of payments, I believe we
                            should give an affirmative reply to this informal inquiry and be in a
                            position at least to discuss this sale. Military assistance credits
                            should not be made available. It should be noted that the sale may not
                            eventuate, since the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is also offering
                            similar submarines for mid-1967 delivery, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> price may be lower than ours.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate your views.<note n="1" xml:id="d401fn1">On March 22,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear George</hi>: During the spring and summer of
                            1961, <persName corresp="#p_BCB1">Chester Bowles</persName> and I
                            discussed the requirement for a missile tracking station in the Republic
                            of South Africa. These discussions resulted in our agreement to proceed
                            with negotiations for the use of a station at Grootfontein through the
                            end of 1963. In turn, I agreed that Defense would undertake to develop
                            ship-borne tracking capabilities for use after that time. As you know,
                            an Agreement was subsequently concluded with South Africa which
                            authorizes our use of a tracking station there through 1963, and
                            thereafter subject to six months notice.</p>
                        <p>It is the purpose of this letter to advise you that we are planning to
                            reorient our efforts to obtain a ship-borne tracking capability for the
                            South African area by up-grading one or more of the ships now used by
                            the Atlantic Missile Range. While it was our original intention to
                            secure a sophisticated tracking ship at an estimated cost in excess of
                            $40 million, the current and foreseeable requirements do not warrant
                            such an expenditure at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Grootfontein station has contributed greatly to our missile program.
                            It will continue to be of importance after 1963 and I would hope that we
                            could continue to use the station after that time. As I indicated
                            earlier, however, we would be prepared to withdraw from the station
                            should this prove politically necessary.</p>

                                a speech by Foreign Minister Louw that spoke of the dramatic
                                increase in power of the Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations, and
                                declared that this bloc was getting some support from Western
                                countries that were more concerned about export markets in new
                                African countries than about the fate of their fellow whites in
                                South Africa. (Ibid.)</note> In absence Ambassador Naude Counselor
                            Dunn called into Department for discussion points raised reftel.
                            Department officer told him Louw speech based on two erroneous pieces
                            information. Emphasized 1) our hope Louw doesn't attribute economic
                            interest as motivating factor our policy vis-à-vis new African states
                            which of course untrue and 2) fact Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"
                                >Williams</persName> did not address conference but simply attended
                            in role of spectator as he might any representative American group
                            discussing Africa. At conclusion of conversation, during which points
                            contained circular telegram 1778<note n="2" xml:id="d403fn2">Not

                            his government. He agreed to do so but commented it will probably whet
                            Louw's appetite as he is spoiling for a good fight.</p>
                        <p>Decision call in Dunn motivated in part by his visit to Department
                            yesterday apparently on <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> instructions
                            to protest remarks attributed to Governor <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"

                            Department officer gave Dunn copy of Maryland speech and noted it
                            contained nothing which had not been said on other occasions by US
                            officials. Fact press item re <persName corresp="#p_WGM1"

                                >Telegram 115 from Cape Town, May 2, analyzed the most significant
                                points in the 125-page draft Bantu laws amendment bill.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I took advantage of Foreign Minister Louw's absence
                            from country to request interview with Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName> in his capacity as Acting
                            Foreign Minister. This took place yesterday afternoon and lasted more
                            than an hour. I first told him of my concern re Bantu laws amendment
                            bill. This bill was so long and complicated that our Embassy had made an
                            analysis of it. It would appear clearly from this analysis that all
                            Bantus outside Bantustans of which there must be some six to seven
                            million would in future be deprived of all their present rights to
                            permanent residence in such areas. They would moreover be entirely
                            subject to decisions of Ministry of Bantu Administration and lower
                            officials and these decisions could not be appealed to Courts. I was
                            therefore leaving him a copy of our analysis in hope that he would have
                            it examined and let us know if it is wrong in any material respect. If
                            not I thought he should know that reaction of US and world opinion in
                            learning of harshness of the terms of this law would be alarmingly
                            strong and would more than negate favorable aspects of Bantustan program
                            with which his Government was moving forward in Transkei.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister said he would not go over our analysis now but would give
                            me some background on subject. He began with consolidation of previous
                            Bantu administration laws made in 1945 and talked at considerable length
                            about his own experience as Minister of Native Affairs (1950-1958). He
                            described misunderstanding by outside world of actions he had taken as
                            Minister to bring Missionary Schools under Government control. This was
                            done however because he had found that under previous system more and
                            more money was being spent annually by Government on same number of
                            Bantu students. As result of steps he had taken this situation was
                            corrected although Missionaries disliked it and it was widely
                            misunderstood abroad. In case of present amendment he said that actually
                            these amendments would go a long way in removing certain frictions.
                            Nevertheless he recognized that certain clauses did present “something
                            new” but did not believe that these clauses went so far as to nullify
                            all favorable aspects of the legislation. At conclusion this discussion
                            he promised to have our analysis examined by appropriate <pb n="632"
                                xml:id="pg_632" facs="0660"/>officials and I again emphasized strong
                            reaction such extreme legislation would have on US and world
                            opinion.</p>

                            Minister exercised all his charm and powers of persuasion on me. While I
                            cannot hope that our analysis and my presentation will dissuade him from
                            going ahead with this legislation, they will at least serve to warn him
                            of our strong reactions to this inhumane measure. Analysis handed him is

                                    it is clear that our two governments are confronted with a
                                    difference of opinion on the subject of multi-racial receptions
                                    in celebration of our Independence Day which seems
                                    irreconcilable at this time.</p>

                            to hold a diplomatic reception on the morning of July 4 would seem to
                            relieve the <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> of the difficulty of
                            being “a party to a deliberate breach of the customs and conventions of
                            this country by the Embassy of the United States” and that it is in fact
                            for this very reason that we are giving such a reception.<note n="2"

                                    >Williams</persName>' memorandum stated that it was time to
                                review U.S. arms supply policy toward South Africa and argued that
                                the United States should be thinking in terms of a total arms
                                embargo. He noted that the current partial arms embargo policy was
                                equivocal, was not an effective pressure on the South Africans, and
                                was considered inadequate by the African countries and by many in
                                the United States who were concerned about racial discrimination.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WGM1">Williams</persName> pointed out that
                                a total arms embargo would fall far short of the complete sanctions
                                already recommended by the General Assembly, and argued that this
                                was the only way the United States could convince both world and
                                domestic opinion that it meant business in its disapproval of
                                apartheid. (Ibid.)</note> raises again some far-reaching issues
                            which ought <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0662"/>to be considered
                            within a broader framework of policy than that relating to the attitudes
                            of the independent states of Africa.</p>
                        <p>At the heart of the issue is how we relate ourselves to those countries
                            whose internal arrangements and practices are not only foreign to our
                            own way of thinking but, in many cases, repugnant to us. Let us accept
                            the general notion that the United States should use its influence
                            steadily and persistently in the direction of the principles inscribed
                            in the United Nations Charter as well as in our own basic commitments to
                            constitutional processes, human rights, etc. It is another question, it
                            seems to me, to extend such influence into the field of sanctions and
                            into actions which, if consistently and conscientiously applied, would
                            interrupt our relations with perhaps half of the existing community of
                            states. Also involved is the position in which we would be if other
                            states undertook to apply sanctions against us because of practices of
                            our own to which they take the strongest exception.</p>
                        <p>It is true that we have the strongest objections to apartheid in the
                            Union of South Africa; we have said so repeatedly and have asserted our
                            view to the point where our relations with the Union of South Africa are
                            in a continuing state of tension. But I believe it is worth reminding
                            ourselves that there are other states where obnoxious practices of one
                            sort or another exist—and in some of them in the most exaggerated form.
                            I have in mind Bulgaria, Burma, China, Czechoslovakia, Ghana, Haiti,
                            Hungary, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Rumania,
                            Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UAR1">UAR</gloss>, Viet-Nam,
                            and Yugoslavia. I have not listed some of the smaller African states
                            whose internal practices reflect varying degrees of totalitarianism nor
                            all of the Arab states whose attitudes in religious minorities or
                            constitutional principles leave much to be desired. The question, it
                            seems to me, is whether we ourselves precipitate sharp crises in our
                            relations with other states over such issues or whether we try to
                            maintain the structure of international relations in order to be able to
                            work doggedly and persistently toward the decent world community which
                            is our main objective. I will admit that apartheid presents a case of
                            unusual difficulty but I would not put it ahead of the violations of
                            human rights within the communist bloc or in certain countries governed
                            on an authoritarian basis with which we have correct and sometimes even
                            friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>I would draw a sharp distinction between our deep concern with respect to
                            racial discrimination in the United States and the way in which we
                            crusade on that very issue outside the United States. The United States
                            is our responsibility; our failures are our failures; we live under a
                            constitutional system in which we can do something about it. But no one
                            has elected us to undertake such responsibilities in other countries.
                            The President has reminded us that we are not interested in a Pax
                            Americana. <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0663"/>It seems to me, a
                            fortiori, that we are not the self-elected gendarmes for the political
                            and social problems of other states.</p>
                        <p>It would be hard to find a single state with which we have relations
                            where it is not necessary for us to try to develop good relations
                            despite important differences in points of view or in action.
                            Specifically with regard to the Union of South Africa, I have felt that
                            we cannot compromise our own attitudes toward apartheid, that we must
                            use our influence wherever possible to modify their position on that
                            matter, but that we must then also try to sustain good relations in
                            other respects despite the severity of our differences on that
                            particular issue. It has seemed to me, therefore, logical that we should
                            not assist the Union of South Africa with means of enforcing its
                            apartheid policy but that we should assist them in playing the kind of
                            role which they have already played in two World Wars and which now is a
                            part of a total confrontation affecting the life and death of our own
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>A proposal for us to embark upon sanctions against the Union of South
                            Africa must, it seems to me, be a part of a package of proposals for
                            sanctions against other states in other situations where different but
                            obnoxious situations obtain. And such proposals should include some
                            concept of priorities—that is, what are the situations which cause us
                            the deepest concern?</p>
                        <p>I have no objection to the most intensive study of apartheid or other
                            situations causing us concern. But I do think that we must give careful
                            thought to the broader questions of 1) how we relate ourselves to the
                            other 94% of the world's peoples whom we can influence but cannot
                            control, and 2) where the interests of the American people lie with
                            regard to actions designed to require someone else to act as we would
                            like to have them act.<note n="2" xml:id="d406fn2">On July 12, <persName

                                that a complete arms ban was the least that the United States could

                                prevent more radical and violent action on their part. He admitted
                                that an arms ban might jeopardize the use of certain tracking and
                                naval facilities in South Africa, but argued that this would be a
                                calculated risk and relatively small in comparison to what else

                        </list>
                        <p>Finding the official comments on our South African holdings somewhat
                            vague, I made some inquiries and discovered that while nothing we have
                            there is vital, there is a close relation between the South African
                            missile tracking station and our satellite photography. This station is
                            a part of the system of observation of these satellites, and while the
                            program would not be interrupted if we should lose it, prudence would
                            dictate certain additional technical developments to permit effective
                            observation of the satellites, and the total cost of replacement is
                            estimated to be on the order of $50 million.</p>
                        <p>In the context of the importance of satellite photography as a whole, $50
                            million is not an enormous amount of money, and undoubtedly some part of
                            this sum will be paid out even if we keep the missile tracking station
                            in South Africa because of a constant desire to refine and improve this
                            vital system of information gathering.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is a good deal of reason to doubt that we would lose the
                            missile tracking station automatically even if we take a stiff line on
                            arms shipment.</p>
                        <p>Still, I thought you would wish to know the order of magnitude of the
                            replacement cost that we might face. I myself remain quite favorable to
                            the Black African position, in spite of this possible dollar cost.</p>

                                Embassy</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary began by stating that he was not responding primarily to
                            the letter from Mr. Louw—that would take considerable study—and
                            continued by saying we are greatly concerned about the Security Council
                            meeting, and others have been sounding us out. A rough time was ahead.
                            The basis of our position in the Security Council meeting will be our
                            opposition to apartheid as a political doctrine. We anticipate a very
                            great controversy in the Council. The Soviet Union will make the most of
                            its opportunity to develop divisions within the free world and to be the
                            champion of the colored races—the same old game. Basic to the United
                            States' policy is the intention to oppose expulsion of South Africa from
                            the United Nations, and mandatory sanctions under Chapter 7. We will be
                            under enormous pressure but do not intend to give in. The Secretary said
                            he did not know what was going to come out of this situation, but he
                            imagined that there might be a resolution which we could support that
                            would oppose apartheid and suggest the appointment by the Secretary
                            General of a high-level special representative to discuss with the South
                            African Government any prospect of a solution more generally acceptable
                            to peoples throughout the world and more in accord with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. The Secretary said he was not
                            debating the merits of this proposal, only indicating the possible
                            direction that a high-level rapporteur might take. Also, there might be
                            a recommendation under Chapter 6 against the export of arms to South
                            Africa which could be used to facilitate the enforcement of
                            apartheid.</p>
                        <p>Our present expectation is that after 1963 we might have to refrain from
                            sending any arms to South Africa. This is not finally decided, nor when
                            we might make this public. It would not be part of the Security Council
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say he did not know the end of the trail, where
                            we are heading, and wished that the Ambassador could help him in that
                            respect.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0668"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Naude expressed appreciation at this opportunity and said it
                            was ironical that ten years ago we were fighting together on the same
                            side, and now South Africa will not even be supplied with arms to use
                            against a common enemy. He did not know how his people would feel—he was
                            greatly disturbed. The Secretary reminded the Ambassador that more than
                            once he had assured the latter of the American anxiety to cooperate with
                            South Africa as much as possible. But the United States point of view
                            must include its strategic interests and the world situation. He
                            expressed the hope that the Ambassador would pass on to his government
                            that the South African problem was a heavy burden to the United States
                            and was creating problems for its strategic interests around the world
                            with respect to facilities, postures, the cooperation of armed forces.
                            This was the direct cause of a situation that was admittedly ironic and
                            also tragic.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Naude then said certainly, South Africa would have to face up
                            to the situation that now the United States' strategic interests
                            elsewhere were more important than those in South Africa. The Secretary
                            replied that he had hoped we would not come to this situation, but our
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff were concerned about our over-all strategic
                            interests, considering the adverse effect of the South African
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Naude said that the South Africans in the past had stood with
                            the United States when the chips were down. He expressed a desire to
                            make a few comments about American strategic interests with respect to
                            South Africa. He had heard a military expert describe the importance of
                            Indonesia and Cuba to the Communists because they lie in narrow seas
                            connecting larger bodies of water such as the Indian Ocean and the
                            Pacific. The same was true of South Africa—it was at a point where two
                            great oceans meet. The South African military effort was aimed at
                            bolstering South Africa's capabilities there. Another important aspect
                            of the strategic situation was the important resources of South Africa.
                            He expressed certainty that the Chiefs of Staff were familiar with South
                            Africa's many strategic minerals, but he also wanted to call the
                            Secretary's attention to the importance of South Africa's gold
                            production, with particular reference to the U.S. Government's action
                            yesterday raising the bank rate. It was of both strategic and economic
                            importance to the United States and its allies that the gold production
                            of South Africa was in the hands of a friendly country.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then referred to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan
                                Cleveland</persName>'s figure of speech about a light at the end of
                            the tunnel. He said that he felt there was still some degree of
                            misunderstanding in the United States about South Africa's situation. It
                            was one of survival, not prejudice. Apartheid envisaged the eventual
                            disappearance of racial discrimination. This would not come tomorrow,
                            but this did not mean that it would take 100 years either.
                            Discrimination would come to an end, but right now it was in the <pb
                                n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0669"/>interests of both sides. The
                            Secretary asked if that concept of the disappearance of discrimination
                            was in Mr. Louw's letter, and the Ambassador assured him that it was.
                            The Ambassador said that South Africa only needed some help in holding
                            the line. It needed time. The United States had a tremendous
                            responsibility, as well as influence, in this situation. The Secretary
                            interjected that our influence in other capitals of the world was about
                            the same as in Pretoria. The Ambassador proceeded to develop the point
                            that the United States was to a large degree responsible for releasing
                            revolutionary forces in the world. He expressed the view that the goal
                            of a great power should be to play down tensions and try to get people
                            to talk together, but the United States without even opening its mouth
                            had released dangerous forces in the world. The Secretary wondered if
                            these forces were not deeply rooted in the nature of man. He wondered if
                            this discourse had not been going on for 2,000 years. Did not man, like
                            most animals, not like to be pushed around too much? The Ambassador
                            indicated that the Secretary had used this same point with him before.
                            The Secretary then said that these troubles were popping up all over the
                            world because of a basic tendency in man's nature. The South African
                            Ambassador still adhered to his argument that the United States had
                            released great forces of a revolutionary nature. He pointed out that
                            Israel was a very basic part of U.S. policy despite its irritation to
                            the Arab world. All South Africa asked, he said, was that it should be
                            treated like Israel; that it was a little nation that needed similar
                            support for survival. The American solution for its own racial problems
                            was not one that could be applied beneficially for South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was not suggesting that a solution practical
                            for the United States should be applied to South Africa. He understood
                            there were about 3-1/2 million whites in South Africa. Did not their
                            survival in a sea of blacks depend on a policy of accommodation with
                            them? The South African Ambassador replied that the accommodation could
                            only be made along the lines of the South African system of apartheid.
                            South Africa was a Western nation which had to be preserved among
                            African nations. South Africa could maintain itself except for the
                            attitude of the outside world. The difficulties had largely come in the
                            last ten years, particularly because of the United Nations. He admitted
                            that the South African Government recently had given itself extreme
                            powers of repression, but he said this was natural considering the
                            extreme threats that were coming from other parts of Africa. The United
                            States should not make these difficulties of South Africa even
                            worse.</p>
                        <p>The South African Ambassador referred to the new Transkei state as an
                            indication of the aim of South African policy. In the last two or three
                            weeks Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName> had
                            stated that the Transkei was just one of several Bantu nations which
                            would emerge, that the Transkei was only the first step. South Africa
                            hoped to make a breakthrough with <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642"
                                facs="0670"/>respect to its relations with other African states by
                            means of this policy of setting up Bantustans, but <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> events which the Secretary had
                            foreshadowed would make the implementation of this Bantustan policy even
                            more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Regarding suggestions that South Africa should make small adjustments of
                            policy, the Ambassador said Foreign Minister Louw maintained that South
                            Africa could not be flexible regarding its basic policy. The Ambassador
                            said that the United States and Russia could not be flexible either
                            about the essentials of their policy. If South Africa made modifications
                            in basic policy, all racial groups would suffer. Flexibility had to be
                            found in other ways such as South Africa's withdrawal from the Economic
                            Commission for Africa. This was something South Africa could do.</p>
                        <p>United States spokesmen have suggested that South Africa's policies were
                            preparing the way for a Communist takeover in Africa. The South African
                            Ambassador said he had just been reading Chernov's (sp?) book The Soviet
                            View of Africa and found the aims of its policy expressed in this book
                            shocking. Only in the last hour he had found that in South Africa there
                            was an organization financed by the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Naude said that if a horizontal adjustment of South African
                            society were made (by this he meant the opposite of vertical apartheid,
                            the suppression of racial groups), the whites would be swamped and
                            southern Africa would be in a more chaotic condition than the Congo had
                            been. This would have grave consequences for American strategic
                            interests. The white group in South Africa was only a handful but it was
                            advanced compared with the people around it. It would take a great deal
                            of power to keep the situation under control if horizontal adjustments
                            were made. A South African leading newspaper repeatedly has said
                            recently that 5 million non-Africans in South Africa (whites, Coloureds
                            and Indians) would not accept the rule of a non-Western majority. There
                            would be resistance and bloodshed. It was not pleasant for him, the
                            Ambassador said to point this out, but presumably the United States
                            would have to be the power to enforce order in this chaotic
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador repeated the intention of ending all discrimination in
                            South Africa. He said that his country realized that in this day and age
                            it was not possible to continue the old practices. He closed with an
                            anecdote about John Adams telling a Livingston that our Puritan
                            forefathers had had to hang their Quakers because they could not afford
                            agitators in their midst while they were threatened by Indians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that he would have to end the interview because
                            of the President's press conference, but there had been a new note he
                            had not heard before in the Ambassador's remarks, and the Secretary <pb
                                n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0671"/>expressed a desire to have a
                            two-hour talk with the Ambassador this week—not the following day
                            because of the pressure of other business, but Friday or Saturday
                            morning. He suggested that the two countries need to discuss the
                            possibility of some breathtaking invention which might salvage the
                            interests of both South Africa and the United States. The Ambassador
                            expressed his readiness to carry on a further discussion.<note n="1"

                            Council meeting, subject to the following comments:</p>
                        <p>The President thinks the statement in paragraph 1(f) should be reframed
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is our current expectation that we will wish to stop further
                                    arms shipments to South Africa after the end of 1963, but we
                                    have not yet decided when to make this intention public.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Our discussion with the South Africans should be in the context of our
                            conviction that the course we are adopting represents the minimum
                            changes necessary if we are to be able to assist in preventing much less
                            satisfactory results, from South Africa's own point of view. It should
                            be emphasized that we intend to oppose Chapter VII measures and that our
                            own suspension of arms shipments will not be of critical importance to
                            South Africa since we are not a prime source for South Africa in this
                            field at present.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes it made clear that in our judgment it would be best
                            for both sides to maintain our existing cooperation in other fields.</p>

                            <item>It is not proposed that we initiate a resolution but that we
                                propose modification of an African resolution with regard to arms
                                embargo. Our position goes beyond what you have previously approved
                                in this important respect: it supports a recommendatory (not
                                mandatory) total arms embargo but with a qualification—a phrase
                                which explicitly says that the embargo is “without prejudice to
                                requirements which may arise for maintaining international peace.”
                                If the Africans refuse to accept this language we would fall back to
                                accepting unqualified language but in voting would make explicit our
                                reservation on arms for “maintaining international peace.”</item>

                                permissive total arms embargo, that France will abstain on any such
                                resolution, and that the British will probably go along with

                                President stating that the resolution before the U.N. Security
                                Council was more contentious than the Department believed was useful
                                or effective, but recommending that, with one amendment, the United
                                States should vote yes on it. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                    >Ball</persName> proposed that the U.S. Delegation be instructed
                                to try hard to eliminate the recommendation for a boycott of all
                                South African goods. If the boycott feature was eliminated, it
                                should vote affirmatively on the resolution as a whole. If it was
                                not eliminated, the United States should abstain. Attached to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s memorandum is a

                            position as of last week but it is probably the best we can do. To
                            organize enough votes to abstain it to death would require your personal
                            intervention with the Venezuelans, Norwegians and possibly the
                            Brazilians. Nothing in the resolution is so bad as to justify this or
                            the even more drastic alternative of casting our first veto.</p>
                        <p>Specifically we would abstain on the whole resolution unless the economic
                            boycott provision is eliminated (which it will almost surely be). We
                            would abstain on some rhetoric in the preamble that is inferentially
                            critical of countries that have previously supplied arms. And we would
                            carefully explain our understanding of the vote—that this is not Chapter
                            7 (mandatory) action; and that we reserve the right to ship arms for the
                            common defense.<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">On August 7, Ambassador

                            worth the President's weekend reading, which showed pretty convincingly
                            that if the United States were to get into any economic reprisal
                            situation with South Africa, the South Africans would have much the best
                            of it. (Ibid., Brubeck Series, South Africa, South African Arms

                        <p>The subject of sanctions against the Republic of South Africa is as
                            complex as it is topical. This paper presents one segment of that
                            subject. It examines a range of possible unilateral US economic measures
                            towards South Africa and estimates their immediate economic impact both
                            on South Africa and on the US. It does not attempt to calculate the
                            impact of multilateral sanctions nor the psychological-political
                            repercussions in South Africa of economic deprivations.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Abstract</hi></p>
                        <p>In general, any feasible US economic sanctions would have little economic
                            impact on South Africa. Among large-scale South African exports, only
                            chrome ore and rock lobstertails depend overwhelmingly on the US market;
                            US purchases of these items account for only about eight percent and one
                            percent of South African exports to the world, respectively. Among South
                            African imports from the US, there appear to be no critical items which
                            South Africa could not do without, although South Africa would suffer
                            temporary inconvenience in shifting to substitute items or alternate
                            sources of supply, especially for spare parts for existing stocks of
                            American machinery and vehicles.</p>
                        <p>South Africa, on the other hand, has some economic leverage on the US. US
                            assets in South Africa are probably at least five times greater than
                            South African assets in the US. The international standing of the US
                            dollar and, by extension, the stability of the integrated Western
                            monetary system, is to a degree dependent on the orderly marketing of
                            gold. South Africa accounts for about 65 percent of Free World gold
                            production, and <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0675"/>it could
                            encourage upward pressure on free market gold by withholding sales. This
                            might induce sudden heavy demands on US gold reserves.</p>
                        <p>Yet symbolic US economic sanctions might have important political
                            repercussions within South Africa. What these might be—reinforcement of
                            apartheid and go-it-alone policies, encouragement of non-white
                            resistance, or a change in direction towards non-racialism—depend on
                            internal South African dynamics. A Departmental strategic study
                            currently under way will attempt the latest and most systematic analysis
                            of this fundamental aspect of the problem.</p>

                            his govt envisages establishment of eight to ten states within confines
                            of the Republic. They would be linked through a confederation or
                            federation. Would be fully independent and doubtless members of <gloss

                        <p>Secretary inquired as to discourse now going on between <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> and non-white leaders. Naude gave
                            indirect answer saying that efforts to create Transkei native state
                            require a great deal of consultation with Blacks. Asked about
                            disparities between land allocated to Whites and Blacks Naude said much
                            of land occupied by Bantu is far better than that of many Whites but
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> is committed to make more land
                            available to Bantu.</p>

                        <p>Secretary asked about measures <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> could
                            take for more fruitful discussion pressing problems. Might begin he
                            commented by liberalizing Bantu Education Act and the pass laws. Naude
                            replied such laws and other forms discrimination which Americans dislike
                            will pass away. Some control over freedom movement necessary prevent
                            overcrowding of cities and to save primitive Bantu from being
                            deAfricanized. Discrimination will disappear with creation native
                            states. In response question if there wouldn't still be considerable
                            admixture of people Amb acknowledged urban Bantu present continuing
                            difficulty but Bantustans will offer counter attractions and Black flood
                            into cities will end.</p>
                        <p>Naude complained that many US officials speak of their desire keep a
                            US-South African dialogue going but dialogues are difficult to maintain
                            when South Africa is whipped publicly. Secretary replied he would be
                            delighted to have something to support. <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                >SAG</gloss> should seek position its friends could defend. We don't

                            done. Naude said Odendaal Report will be released before UNGA meeting.
                            The report will be a starting point.</p>
                        <p>Secretary felt <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> has view of Territory
                            entirely different from rest of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He
                            asked why <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> doesn't take initiative

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said that an idea was
                            being put forward at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for
                            “strategic sanctions” against South Africa. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> was opposed to the application of sanctions except when
                            there was a threat to peace. The trouble with Security Council
                            resolutions was that they were mandatory. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> would accordingly have to veto any “strategic sanctions”
                            resolution as it was unlikely that enough abstentions could be obtained.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1">Stevenson</persName> had
                            indicated, <persName corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said, that
                            the U.S. might go along with some selective sanctions.</p>

                        <p>The President replied that we had gone along on the arms embargo. We
                            would not go beyond that and would not support sanctions. The question
                            was how best to stop them. He thought that the British should not be too
                            disturbed at the idea of casting a veto.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Jooste and Ambassador Naude asked to see me alone for a few minutes
                            after a conversation covered by another memorandum.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d418fn1">Not printed.</note> Mr. Jooste told me in great
                            confidence that the South African Government is most seriously and
                            urgently considering withdrawal from the United Nations. He said that
                            they had in mind three elements: (a) South Africa's own national
                            interest in the face of repeated and almost unanimous condemnations and
                            repetitions of embarrassments and harassments in the United Nations and
                            its component organs; (b) withdrawal from the United Nations might serve
                            to reduce difficulties for certain countries with whom South Africa has
                            had long and friendly ties and (c) South African withdrawal from the
                            United Nations might indeed be of some assistance to the United Nations
                            itself since it would continue to have an important role to play and
                            might not be damaged by a continuation of the present situation.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Jooste that this was a matter of such seriousness that I would
                            not wish to comment off the cuff; that I would not wish to give any
                            views of our Government off the cuff, but that I would make the
                            following preliminary comments: (a) that the South African Government
                            might wish to consider carefully the reasons for its withdrawal and
                            examine <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0681"/>realistically whether
                            the purposes to be achieved would in fact be achieved by withdrawal. For
                            example, the withdrawal of South Africa would not cause the South
                            African issue to disappear from the United Nations agenda; (b) I could
                            tell him straightaway that the United States would not wish to ask South
                            Africa to withdraw in order to make things easier in the United Nations
                            for the United States. Although it is true that we have had many painful
                            situations confronting us in the United Nations because of the South
                            African problem, we felt that these were problems inherent in the
                            situation itself and that under no circumstances would we suggest their
                            withdrawal to ease our own situation; (c) I added that I was quite sure
                            in my own mind that they should not give weight to their withdrawal as a
                            means of assisting the United Nations. Indeed, although I know of no way
                            in which the question could be posed, it would be my impression that if
                            the question of South African withdrawal were put to the membership of
                            the United Nations, there would be a large majority indicating that they
                            should not do so. I noted that the earlier effort to expel or suspend
                            South Africa had gathered no substantial support and was now in my
                            judgment a thing of the past; (d) on the question of any comment which
                            we might have to make with respect to South Africa's own interests, I
                            felt that that was a matter in which I would not wish to speak without
                            further consideration since no such comments should be made
                            irresponsibly. I told him that if we had anything further to say, we
                            would try to do so in the next very few days.</p>

                        <p>There is a good chance that the South African issue and, perhaps, the
                            Portuguese-Africa issue will be up again in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Security Council in November. One of the hard-to-measure
                            factors we will face, as we did in <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654"
                                facs="0682"/>August, is how strong African opinion is on these
                            issues and, therefore, how tough a political issue it really is for us
                            with the Africans.</p>
                        <p>On this score, the attached analysis<note n="1" xml:id="d419fn1">Current

                            (based in part on a thoro canvass of our African posts) suggests that
                            the factor of African reaction may be less important than is sometimes
                            claimed. There was very little evidence, in the African press, in
                            statements to our Embassies, or in other forms of any great African
                            concern with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> performance. In fact
                            our status in Africa probably improved because of our vote on the South
                            African resolution and because the Portuguese agreed to talk to the

                            not, however, very relevant to our current problem about how to handle

                            which the Secretary of State will be sending over a paper Monday. He
                            will propose, in effect, that we hold the line at our position of the

                        <p>There is a debate going on within State over proposed action to stop US

                            proposals will probably not mature for a while but the economic sections

                        <p>The heart of the attached study is a “long range proposal” (210-231)
                            which picks up a remark of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VHF1"
                                >Verwoerd</persName>'s and develops from it a scheme for a set of
                            modest reforms by the South African Government in return for which the
                            US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would give categorical support
                            to the South African Government politically. While the reforms are
                            modest and gradual, they are basic because the South African Government
                            would have openly to scrap apartheid—a complete admission of defeat for
                            its present policy.</p>
                        <p>What is particularly interesting about this proposal is that within the
                            US Government support for it ranges from the liberal, pro-Black Africans
                            (such as the authors of this piece) to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJC1">Satterthwaite</persName> and the CAS in South
                            Africa. (The latter of whom is as far to the right as any one in the US
                            Government on the subject of South Africa.) The scheme may, therefore,
                            be a starter in two ways—first as a serious proposal to the South
                            Africans and second, if they refuse it, as a public US gambit which
                            would seriously split Verwoerd's near-monolithic present white support.
                            The second point might be important, because the complaint of South
                            African liberal whites now is that, by being so militantly hostile, the
                            Western powers are driving even liberal white South Africans into the
                            Verwoerd camp. In any event, even if it has practical interest, there's
                            serious doubt whether South Africa is yet ripe for such a proposal.</p>

                            apartheid in South Africa. This policy has been developed in close

                        <p>We propose to continue opposing mandatory sanctions and to indicate

                            we think appropriate to deal with the problem. At the same time, in
                            order to show our continuing concern about apartheid and to help deflect
                            support from a more radical resolution, we would be prepared to
                            interpret our existing policy on arms restrictions to include an embargo
                            on materials used primarily in the production of arms and ammunition.
                            The Norwegians have developed such a proposition; Governor <persName

                            addition, we would be prepared to accept a suitable version of an expert

                        <p>I agree with your proposed course of action on South Africa in the
                            Security Council and share strongly your view that, having made a major
                            concession in August, we cannot get in the position of having to make
                            substantial new concessions on this issue every few months. I think it
                            important, therefore, that in announcing our willingness to apply the
                            arms embargo to “materials for the production of military equipment” we
                            make it very clear that we regard this as merely part of the position we
                            voluntarily took in August and that the August resolution should be
                            given a more reasonable further term to do its work.<note n="1"

                        <p>You will recall that in September you authorized exploratory technical
                            talks regarding South Africa's interest in a $90-130 million purchase of
                            submarines with the clear understanding that the talks would involve no
                            express or implied commitment on the part of the U.S. to sell and that,
                            in any event, no decision would be made before the end of this year. As
                            a result of a first round in South Africa, State and Defense are now
                            considering a South African proposal for another round of exploratory
                            talks here in the near future.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>
                        <p>The prospective value of sale, however, is now down to about $38 million
                            due to South Africa's preference for a smaller, cheaper submarine which
                            the Navy got ELCO to design expressly to meet South African needs. South
                            Africa also has indicated interest in some other military purchases, of
                            which the only plausible one seems to be a $ 35-40 million air defense
                            system for their Simonstown Naval Base.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that in the Security Council debate in August we
                            announced termination of all military sales to South Africa by the end
                            of this year but reserved the right of possible future sales where
                            required for “the common defense.” With the South African issue becoming
                            steadily more difficult internationally, we now have two problems: <list>

                                <item>In order to retrieve some balance of payments value, should we
                                    not only continue submarine talks, but also entertain some
                                    additional South African requests such as the Simonstown air

                        <p>Some weeks ago the African Bureau appointed Ulrich Haynes, a young Negro,
                            as Desk Officer for Southwest Africa and the High Commission
                            Territories. They have now scheduled him for a trip to the Hicom
                            Territories and we are getting into a first-class fight with South
                            Africa over the matter.</p>
                        <p>The South Africans first objected to any visa, then after several
                            exchanges, have now offered grudgingly minimum physical transit rights
                            through South Africa to the Hicom Territories.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has called the South
                            Africans in and taken a very tough line on our claim to normal
                            diplomatic treatment for Negro officers. However, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VHF1">Verwoerd</persName> is apparently making the
                            decisions himself and we may reach an impasse.</p>
                        <p>Specifically we are demanding a visa to permit 3 days consultation with
                            our Embassy in Pretoria and travel by auto to the Hicom Territories. We
                            are awaiting a Verwoerd reply. Meanwhile the South African Foreign
                            Office has informed us that their real objection is to Haynes'
                            assignment to the Southwest Africa desk (which, for their part, reflects
                            their view of Southwest Africa as part of South Africa).<note n="1"

                        <p>Unless the South Africans back down, given the position the Secretary has
                            taken, we may find ourselves in a minor diplomatic war—bringing home the
                            Ambassador and leaving the First Secretary in charge or similar actions.
                            And, since it seems to me evident that AF really wanted to test this
                            one, it may well become a public issue of some news interest. It is
                            obviously a parallel to the Arab boycott of Jews, and even (with regard
                            to access rights to the High Commission Territories via South Africa) a
                            faint parallel to Berlin—all this and civil rights too.</p>
                        <p>We are now waiting for the South African Foreign Office to get a reply
                            from Verwoerd on our demand for normal diplomatic treatment. This may
                            come up, therefore, while I am away next week.</p>
