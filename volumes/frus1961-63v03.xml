                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy. This volume
                    also includes documents from the private collections of various government
                    officials connected with U.S. policy toward Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series is
                    edited by the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of
                    State. The editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in
                    accordance with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary
                    of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925:</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating the place
                    in the text where the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose
                    of concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>To avoid publication of matters that would tend to impede current
                            diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>
                        <label>b.</label>
                        <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                            details.</item>
                        <label>c.</label>
                        <item>To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals
                            and by foreign governments.</item>
                        <label>d.</label>
                        <item>To avoid giving needless offense to other nationalities or

                            upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one
                            qualification: in connection with major decisions it is desirable, where
                            possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the
                            decision was made.</item>

                        1961-1963, Volume III</hi></p>
                <p>Preparation of this volume proceeded in 1984 on the basis of a research plan
                    developed by the editors after a preliminary review of repositories in both
                    governmental and private agencies. From the outset the editors approached their
                    research realizing the need to supplement the written record of U.S. policy
                    during the Vietnam war with interviews of officials who participated in the
                    policy process. They also reviewed those oral history interviews of participants
                    already in existence and available in various locations. Oral history citations
                    are provided in the footnotes to the text.</p>
                <p>On the basis of their preliminary research and review of already published
                    documentation, including the 1971 “Pentagon Papers,” the editors developed the
                    following six areas of focus for further research and the selection of documents
                    for inclusion in this volume: 1) Discussion and formulation of policy in
                    Washington; 2) Policy implementation in South Vietnam; 3) The relationship among
                    the United States Government, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                    government, and dissident elements in South Vietnam; 4) The implications of the
                    Buddhist crisis which developed in May; 5) U.S. intelligence assessments of the
                    situation in Vietnam and the viability of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                        >Diem</persName> government and the prospects of a potential coup; and 6)
                    U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. The editors did take careful account of
                    the documentation in the “Pentagon Papers,” but have, in general, sought to
                    avoid reprinting documents already published there.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion and formulation of policy in Washington:</hi>
                    President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">John F. Kennedy</persName> made the
                    important policy decisions on Vietnam, based on advice from the Washington
                    foreign affairs community, either orally at meetings or in documents submitted
                    to him. The records of these meetings with the President and advice provided to
                    him in writing are a focus of this volume. The editors are confident that they
                    have had complete access to all the Presidential written records bearing on
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The most important repository for records on high-level policy formulation is the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">John F. Kennedy</persName> Presidential Library.
                    The records of the Department of State, to which the editors had complete
                    access, also include a large collection of Presidential and National Security
                    Council documentation. The papers of the President’s Military Representative,
                    General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell D. Taylor</persName>, at the
                    National Defense University in Washington, D.C., were also of unusual
                    importance. The documents in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                    Papers provide a unique record of <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                    >Taylor</persName>’s advice to the President on Vietnam and records of some
                    meetings both at the White House and at the Department of Defense for which
                    there are no other accounts. Department of Defense records, especially files and
                    papers of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert S.
                        McNamara</persName>, located at the <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"
                    />Washington National Records Center, were an important subsidiary source. A
                    private collection, the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">W. Averell
                        Harriman</persName> Papers, were also of considerable utility. Used with the
                    late Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s permission
                    when they were still in his possession, these papers are now housed at the
                    Library of Congress, Manuscript Division. The <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Roger
                        Hilsman</persName> papers, located at the Kennedy Library, also proved an
                    important source of documents not found in official files.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Policy implementation in South Vietnam:</hi> The editors also
                    selected documentation that covered the implementation of
                    Presidentially-established policy and a small range of lesser policy decisions
                    that did not reach the White House or were resolved in the Department of State
                    or other agencies of the foreign affairs community. The files of the Department
                    of State, the Department of Defense, the Kennedy Library, and the United States
                    Information Agency are the primary documentary sources for these decisions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The relationship among the United States Government, the
                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government, and dissident
                        elements in South Vietnam:</hi> From the development of the Buddhist crisis
                    in May 1963 to late August 1963 when this volume concludes, relations between
                    the United States and the Republic of Vietnam were strained. The extensive
                    reports of U.S. Embassy relations with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                        >Diem</persName> government come primarily from the central files of the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>The fact that the United States was in close contact with dissident elements in
                    South Vietnam makes events in Saigon crucial to understanding U.S. policy. The
                    editors have, therefore, included a considerable number of telegraphic reports
                    from the Embassy and the Central Intelligence Agency Station in Saigon on
                    relations with dissident Vietnamese. Central Intelligence Agency records were
                    obtained from the Kennedy Library, Department of State files, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Papers, Department of Defense records,
                    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff files. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    provided full access to the Department historians to Agency documents in the
                    Presidential libraries, and many of these documents are printed here. Some
                    access was eventually provided to documentation retained by the Agency itself,
                    but too late for documents to be included in this volume. Significant
                    declassified material obtained from the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    archives for 1963 will be printed in a subsequent volume in the <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">The implications of the Buddhist crisis which developed in
                        May:</hi> The Buddhist crisis had a profound effect on political
                    developments in Vietnam, and a corresponding important effect upon U.S.
                    assessments and U.S. policy toward Vietnam. Telegraphic reports from the Embassy
                    in Saigon, the Consulate in Hue, and the Central Intelligence Agency Station in
                    Saigon were the primary source of information on the unfolding of the crisis.
                    Much of the material relating to the Buddhist crisis was found in the central
                    files of the Department of State.</p>

                    This volume and its companion, which documents the latter part of 1963 (volume
                    IV), include communications between the Central Intelligence Agency and its
                    Station in Saigon. In addition to these telegrams, a representative selection of
                    finished intelligence assessments prepared by the U.S. intelligence community is
                    printed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. military involvement in Vietnam:</hi> The editors sought
                    to include documentation that illustrated the relationship between military
                    planning and strategy and the conduct of relations with the Republic of Vietnam
                    and other countries. No attempt was made ot document operational details of U.S.
                    military involvement in Vietnam. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                        >Taylor</persName> Papers, the files of the Secretary of Defense and the
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the
                    Washington National Records Center, and the decentralized files of the
                    Department of State’s Vietnam Working Group are the principal sources for this
                    topic.</p>
                <p>The editors also devoted significant attention to the sensitive question of press
                    coverage of developments in Vietnam. For documentation relating to public
                    affairs and press relations, the files of the United States Information Agency
                    are important.</p>
                <p>The editors of the volume are confident that the documents printed here provide a
                    comprehensive and accurate foreign affairs record of United States policy toward
                    and involvement in Vietnam during the first eight months of 1963. The
                    declassification review process for the documents selected for this volume,
                    outlined in more detail below, resulted in withholding from publication only 1.2
                    percent of the original manuscript.</p>

                    history interviews for this volume.</p>

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted. The
                    editors were <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>not always able to
                    determine the precise chronological order of documents produced during periods
                    of crisis and intense activity, particularly during the Buddhist crisis. In
                    these cases they used their best judgment.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the Foreign Relations series
                    follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by guidance from the Editor in
                    Chief and the chief technical editor. The source text is reproduced as exactly
                    as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an omission in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also
                    used to indicate text that has been omitted because it deals with an unrelated
                    subject (in roman type) or because it remained classified after the
                    declassification review process (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source footnote also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates if the
                    President and/or his major policy advisers read it. Every effort has been made
                    to determine if a document has been previously published and this information
                    has been included in the source footnote. If two or more different accounts of a
                    meeting or event of comparable value are available and one or more is already
                    declassified and published, the editors chose to print the still unpublished one
                    and obtain its declassification.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in this volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and summarize and provide citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when applicable to
                    supplement the official record.</p>

                <p>Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic and
                    functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of the
                    U.S. Government, and appropriate foreign governments regarding documents of
                    those governments. The principle guiding declassification review is to release
                    as much information as is consistent with contemporary requirements of national
                    security and sound foreign relations.</p>

                                    Through January 1963, the Department of State continued to use
                                    the decimal central file system familiar to users of previous
                                    volumes of the Foreign Relations series. In February 1963, the
                                    Department changed its decimal central files to a
                                    subject-numeric central file system. This is the first volume to
                                    be published in the Foreign Relations series in which documents
                                    selected from the Department’s central files come primarily from
                                    the new system. As part of the transition to the new system, the
                                    Department of State encouraged its indexers to cross-reference
                                    extensively and to include the first page of the referenced
                                    document in the cross-referenced file. The system allows the
                                    researcher to use a basic file and find other pertinent files by
                                    noting the cross references.</p>
                                <p>The subject-numeric system was divided into broad categories:
                                    Administration, Consular, Culture and Information, Economic,
                                    Political and Defense, Science, and Social. Within each of these
                                    divisions were subcategories. For example, Political and Defense
                                    contained four subtopics: POL (politics), DEF (Defense), CSM
                                    (Communism), and INT (Intelligence). Numerical subdivisions
                                    further defined them. An important file for the Buddhist crisis

                        <p>On January 2, 1963, regular army and civil guard forces of the Republic
                            of Vietnam engaged a Viet Cong battalion at the village of Ap Bac in
                            Dinh Tuong province, 35 miles southwest of Saigon in the Mekong Delta.
                            The South Vietnamese forces enjoyed a 4-1 numerical advantage in the
                            battle, and, unlike the Viet Cong, were supported by artillery, armor,
                            and helicopters. Despite the disparity of numbers and weapons, the Viet
                            Cong battalion inflicted heavy casualties on the government forces and
                            escaped with minor losses. Three American advisers were killed in the
                            fighting and five helicopters were shot down.</p>
                        <p>The United States Army Command in the Pacific reported the battle to the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff as “one of the bloodiest and costliest battles of
                            S. Vietnam war” and noted that the battle “will provide enemy with
                            morale-building victory”. (Summary telegram 677 from <gloss

                            Country Series, 1/63) Lieutenant Colonel John P. Vann, senior United
                            States adviser to the Seventh Division of the Army of the Republic of
                            Vietnam, filed an after-action report on the Ap Bac operation which
                            concluded that the operation was a failure. Vann attributed the failure
                            to the poor state of training of the South Vietnamese units, a system of
                            command which never placed a Vietnamese officer above the rank of
                            captain on the battlefield, a reluctance to incur casualties, an
                            inability to take effective advantage of air superiority, and a lack of
                            discipline in battle. (After-Action Report by Senior Adviser 7th

                            Vietnamese forces at Ap Bac had made a number of errors, but he
                            characterized them largely as errors of courage rather than cowardice.
                            “It took a lot of guts”, he wrote, “on the part of those pilots and <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0029"/>crews to go back into the area to
                            try to rescue their pals.” “Like any engagements in war”, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> concluded, “there are days-and
                            there are days. This day they got a bear by the tail and they didn’t let
                            go of it. At least they got most of it.” <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName>’ assessment closely paralleled that of Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Harry D. Felt</persName>, Commander in

                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> noted that it was “important to
                            realize that bad news about American casualties filed immediately by
                            young reporters representing the wire services without careful checking
                            of the facts.” He conceded that the South Vietnamese forces had made
                            mistakes at Ap Bac based upon faulty intelligence and inexperience, but
                            he added “along with the bad news of damage to helicopters and three
                            Americans lost, there is good news which you may not read about in <hi

                            other military operations being undertaken successfully by South
                            Vietnamese forces, and concluded: “It also hurts here when irresponsible
                            newsmen spread the word to American public that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                        <p>At this point some thirty-six hours after having arrived in Saigon, I

                            inevitably gives a sense of movement and progress. The trouble is,
                            however, that the progress and the movement is highly uneven. One would
                            wish that this is the fault of the Vietnamese, and it is to a
                            considerable extent. But I am afraid that a great share of the
                            responsibility belongs with the Americans. We have the impression that
                            any one of these programs such as the strategic hamlet program or really
                            any of the others requires precise and efficient coordination of the
                            different activities of many different American agencies. And you also
                            have the impression that this coordination is not really being
                            accomplished. One example is the failure to provide a police program
                            that even remotely is phased in with the provision of wire for the
                            strategic hamlets and radios for the strategic hamlets. Thus you have
                            strategic hamlets going up enclosing Communists inside their boundaries
                            with no provisions for wrinkling [<hi rend="italic">winkling</hi>?] out
                            those Communists. Other things are similar. You have also the impression
                            that the military is still too heavily oriented towards sweep-type
                            operations. There is still the same emphasis on air power as there was
                            before. Almost every operation so far as I can tell still begins with an
                            air strike which inevitably kills innocent people and warns the Viet
                            Cong that they should get moving for the troops will be coming soon. I
                            think it justifies [<hi rend="italic">signifies</hi>?] that the
                            Americans are as much to blame for this as the Vietnamese. That <gloss

                        <p>One of the reasons for their optimism is apparently the vigor with which
                            the South Vietnamese government and especially Brother <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> have pushed the strategic hamlet
                            program. (<persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName> also
                            mentioned that without <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName>
                            enthusiastic and vigorous backing, the strategic hamlet program would
                            probably not have gotten off the ground. He went on to say, in fact,
                            that he is wrong in his worry earlier this year that the Vietnamese
                            would endanger the program by doing too much of it in too many places.
                            He now feels that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was not
                            wrong in doing this because it attracted a great deal of attention to
                            the program all over Vietnam and hence got an essential momentum.)</p>
                        <p>Beyond the above it is hard to see exactly what specific basis there is
                            for the Embassy’s optimism. Partly it is a question of mood. The sense
                            of activity is much stronger. The morale of the Vietnamese at least in
                            Saigon is higher principally because something is being done and because
                            so much American aid which is so visible has appeared. On a factual
                            basis, they cite as reasons for optimism the increased activity of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>—they are going out more often,
                            attacking more often, and even occasionally engaging in night attacks.
                            (However, see the Memcon of the Conversation with General Ed
                                Rowny.)<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3"><ref target="#d4">Document

                        <p>I mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> the
                            figures that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> gave me—that
                            18,000 Viet Cong had been killed this past year, but that the total Viet
                            Cong regular strength nevertheless rose from 18,000 to about 22,000 to
                            24,000 with the sympathizers and supporters remaining about the same.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> scoffed at this and
                            said that the explanation was only that the statistics were more
                            accurate, meaning that last year <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0032"
                            />there were considerably more than 18,000. I still find this hard to
                            believe completely, however, since that would have given a total of
                            around 42,000 regulars in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> last
                            year and I am sure that though the intelligence was not very good, it
                            was considerably better than that differential would indicate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> is running a so-called
                            Junior Country Team which is apparently the guiding direction of the
                            American effort on the strategic hamlet program. He is reportedly doing
                            an excellent job at this. However, I do think his optimism stems in part
                            from identification with the local scene and that it is not entirely
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>I told [<hi rend="italic">queried</hi>?] both <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and <persName>Bill
                                Trueheart</persName> on the question of whether the officials, both
                            civilian and military, were frustrated by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s failures to delegate since this could be a very
                            serious morale problem while parliamentary elections are not. They both
                            said that the officials that they and their staff contacted did not
                            evidence any such frustration nor had they heard of any from other
                            American representatives reporting on their contact. (This, of course,
                            could be attributed to the morale improvement as a result of American
                            aid and might not, therefore, be a permanent phenomenon—i.e., the
                            frustration might manifest itself again if there is no substantial
                            progress in the war itself as opposed to progress in the arrival of
                            American aid.)</p>
                        <p>Part of our discussion concerned the Cambodian problem. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is very strong in the view
                            that he could persuade the South Vietnamese to be exceptionally
                            forthcoming in a settlement with Cambodia of their outstanding problems
                            if the United States were willing to back bilateral guarantees for
                            Cambodia rather than an international conference which the South
                            Vietnamese fear. He thinks the quid pro quo of the U.S. opposing a
                            conference would be sufficient to make the Vietnamese forthcoming. It
                            was agreed that he would draft a cable inviting instructions to explore
                            the problem with the Vietnamese government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> are also pleased with the
                            Montagnard program. Paradoxically, one of the things that pleases them
                            is the way that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has managed to
                            take arms away from the Montagnards without alienating them so far as we
                            can tell. Here the device the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> used
                            was to take the people who are giving up weapons out to the new villages
                            so that they could see that their weapons were being given to other
                            Montagnards who are in less secure areas. The reason that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> are pleased, of course, is
                            that the Sough Vietnamese Government is nervous about the Montagnards
                            and about their having too many arms and extremely anxious that the arms
                            be taken away as the areas become more secure. (I am myself a little
                            nervous that the weapons are being taken away prematurely. The <pb n="7"
                                xml:id="pg_7" facs="0033"/>Montagnard strategic hamlet program is
                            essential if the infiltration routes are to be cut and I am surprised to
                            find the areas are regarded as secure so soon.)</p>
                        <p>I questioned <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> on the progress
                            made in providing police for the strategic hamlets. Apparently an
                            experimental program for one or two villages has been started, but
                            nothing much more. (This to my mind is an enormous gap in the
                            implementation of the strategic hamlet concept.)</p>

                        <p>Ed Rowny is a Major General here on a special mission to provide new
                            weapons and techniques for use in South Vietnam over and above the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program. This is a result of the
                            fact that Rowny was the Executive Secretary of the Howze Board, which
                            made a study of modern techniques of conventional war and mobility last
                            year. He was scheduled to take command of a division in Korea as the
                            youngest division Commander in the Army, but was switched to South
                            Vietnam because of his unique background and experience.</p>
                        <p>I have known Rowny for some 15 years—first when he and I were graduate
                            students together at Yale studying international politics. He is a most
                            unusual Army officer in that he has had advance training in the
                            political side of the equation and this training has taken root in a
                            sophisticated and excellent mind. His judgments from the situation,
                            therefore, are ones to which I would give great weight.</p>
                        <p>Rowny is optimistic, but with considerable reservations.</p>
                        <p>One of the greatest troubles he feels is <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"

                            sends and forwards to Washington only those that he and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> deem appropriate. Rowny says
                            that on one occasion <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> called
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> down for infoing the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> also exercises a very tight
                            personal control over requests for equipment. For example, Rowny will
                            recommend to <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> the
                            introduction from Department of Army sources rather than <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, of some new weapon or technique or
                            some such. If <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> decides
                            that it will contribute to the war in Vietnam, the Department of the
                            Army will then honor the request. But <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> must also concur and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> has not concurred on a very high percentage of the
                            requests. Rowny feels that his operation is about fifteen percent
                            effective, the rest of the time and energy going into attempting to
                            persuade <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Rowny has been on some 20 operations. He describes the typical one as
                            follows. The troops are scheduled to move at a certain hour in the
                            morning. Usually there is a considerable delay waiting for a previous
                            air strike. The air strike is then made on a village at which the Viet
                            Cong is reported to be ensconced. The helicopters then move out, the
                            troops are landed outside the village and they start forward. After a
                            little while there is a flurry on the right and someone drags a peasant
                            out of a rice paddy where he had been hiding. The peasant is bound and
                            taken prisoner as a “suspected Viet Cong.” They then proceed up the road
                            towards the village. Some time later another flurry appears on the left
                            and a man runs towards the jungle. He is shot and killed and marked down
                            as a Viet Cong since he ran.</p>
                        <p>They then proceed to the village which is deserted except for an old man

                            >as</hi>?] Rowny describes her. Under interrogation the senile old man
                            or addled girl points toward some spot in the jungle, or some cellar or
                            something. The troops go there and drag out a man who is hiding who is
                            then bound and captured as a “suspected <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss>.” The operation has now reached noon. Everyone sits
                            down, cooks their rice and meal. Patrols are sent out and around finding
                            nothing and then an hour or so later the helicopters come to pick the
                            troops up and take them back to their regular billets.</p>
                        <p>We discussed why [there are] such elaborate operations, which are
                            preceded by bombing, warning the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and
                            proceeding so slowly as to give the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            ample time to escape. Rowny puts it down to two things. One, reluctance
                            on the part of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> really to
                            engage in a battle. <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0035"/>As he says,
                            they do not really want to tangle with the enemy, they want to be
                            completely safe and not have any really serious fight. The second reason
                            is <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s attitude towards
                            “defeats.” <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s cold
                            propaganda line, as we well know, is that there must never be a defeat
                            even a small one, but only one long series of victories. (For example
                            where the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was pleased with my speech
                            given in Chicago,<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">For text of this speech,

                                >USIA</gloss> which had distributed 2000 copies in English to
                            translate it into Vietnamese because it admitted that there were some
                            dark spots in the picture and that there was some reason to be cautious
                            about one’s optimism.) Rowny told of the story where one of the much
                            better commanders, more aggressive commanders, took a group out, killing
                            three Viet Cong officers and 60 regular Viet Cong troops capturing their
                            weapons in a stiff battle in which the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1"
                                >ARVN</gloss> lost one officer and several men. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was furious at this “defeat”; to
                            lose an officer is a defeat in his eyes. This pressure for only
                            victories and only total victories at that, leads to excessive caution
                            on the part of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, in Rowny’s
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>The fact remains that the extended jungle patrolling extended in time

                            power, on sweeps, on strikes, and so on.</p>
                        <p>The one encouraging note in the military picture is that some of these
                            operations are of the “clear and hold variety.” That is the troops go
                            out at least a site north of Viet Cong if they do not, or only rarely,
                            seize them or surround them and the province chiefs and what civic
                            action teams are available, then put in strategic villages providing the
                            hold part of the clear and hold.<note n="5" xml:id="d4fn5">This confused
                                sentence suggests that the tape recording was again difficult to

                            are some of these operations among the sweep operations and, of course,

                            apparently does not like a bureaucratic fight and wishes to avoid it if
                            possible. For example, he makes no protest when <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> moves squads around on the <pb

                            will make <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> happy, okay. He
                            feels that <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> is a good
                            officer and competent, but not an imaginative and driving, highly
                            motivated or creative officer.</p>
                        <p>Rowny is very high on <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and
                            he feels that if <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> were off
                            his back and if he had the authority, that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> would be able to manage the war very well
                            indeed, although Rowny added that he, of course, had no real basis for
                            this kind of prediction since he had not seen <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> in action, but was only giving
                            this as his impression that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> would do a good job if given more opportunity
                            and scope.</p>
                        <p>Rowny feels that what is really saving us out here is the high quality of
                            the sergeants, lieutenants and captains. We discussed the failure on the
                            civilian side to give as much impetus and vigor to what is going on out
                            here as it should do and Rowny said that he had discussed this with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> chief, and with <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> fellow, who seems to be doing such a
                            good job in the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> part of the
                            strategic hamlet program. Both <persName corresp="#p_PRC1"
                                >Phillips</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Mecklin</persName> pointed out that the civilian agencies simply
                            cannot lay their hands on the high-quality, high-talented younger people
                            that the military can just arbitrarily assign to Vietnam, that the
                            civilian tasks can be better accomplished by the high-quality
                            lieutenants and captains than they could be by the much lower quality
                            civilians that would be the only ones available.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting that a number of these captains and majors are becoming
                            strong advocates of fewer sweep operations and more civil and political
                            action programs which tends to bear out <persName corresp="#p_MJ1"
                                >Mecklin</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_PRC1"
                                >Phillips</persName>’ judgments.</p>
                        <p>Another problem that Rowny discussed was the Air Force vs. Army-Air. The
                            Air Force is very reluctant to provide escort aircraft for helicopter
                            missions. They put “interdiction” on a higher priority than supporting
                            or escorting helicopters and “retaining command of the air” at an even
                            higher priority. There is, of course, no air opposition so it is hard to
                            justify failure to support the helicopters on the grounds of maintaining
                            air superiority. One wonders what they would interdict also, since any
                            movement is by infiltration routes. Apparently what they mean by
                            interdiction is precisely the air strikes on reported <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> villages. The Army has gotten around this
                            a little bit by using the Mohawk in an air-support role. The problem
                            here, however, is that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has
                            put a restriction on what the Mohawk can carry limiting it only to
                            machine guns rather than the rockets and other equipment that it could
                            carry. To some extent this had had a beneficial effect in that the
                            combination of using the Army Mohawk and its light armament has made the
                            Air Force somewhat more forthcoming in providing some air support for
                            the helicopter operations. The situation, however, seems to be far from
                            satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>Judging from what Rowny said, <persName corresp="#p_FMV1"
                                >Forrestal</persName> and I have begun to wonder whether it is wise
                            to approve the requested augmentation in Farmgate.<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d4fn7">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3, Document

                            permission might be good as a disciplinary measure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> posed the question to
                            Rowny as to whether it would be impossible to issue instructions to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> which in effect kept
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in the act for
                                supplies,<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and all of this,
                            administration in other words, but cut <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> out as regards operations, policy decisions, and so
                            on. Rowny said that there was no reason at all that this could not be
                            arranged without ruining the military’s chain of command. He thought it
                            was easily possible and certainly desirable.</p>
                        <p>The following represents <persName corresp="#p_FMV1"
                            >Forrestal</persName>’s remembrance of the Rowny conversation. Rowny
                            made three separate points.</p>
                        <p>The first point was the relationship of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> to the South Vietnamese operation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> runs the South Vietnam operation
                            like a ship. He interferes in details of tactical planning. He denies
                            requests for equipment. <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            cannot communicate directly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> actually directs some tactical
                            operations from Hawaii.</p>
                        <p>The second major point is that the Air Force is not always providing
                            adequate close aerial support. The Mohawk, for example, is an airplane
                            which could carry a great deal more armaments and provide good close
                            support, but the Air Force does not want tactical aircraft in Army
                            hands. Rowny also feels that there is a tendency to use air power for
                            interdiction rather than for close support.</p>
                        <p>The third major point that Rowny made was concerned with personnel. The
                            best people are the majors, captains and lieutenants. The poorest people
                            are at the staff level in all of the agencies. The top levels, meaning
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> are good. And also <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName> is excellent. The
                            intermediates are not at all good and <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TWC1"
                                >Trueheart</persName> are effective by calling on the captains and
                            majors and by-passing or detouring the top intermediate levels of the
                            military. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is no good at all,
                            except for <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName>. Rowny
                            also feels that there are too many American generals in South

                        </list>
                        <p>Present were the heads of all the agencies there. The first item on the
                            agenda was the planned operation beginning today which was a very large
                            scale sweep operation directed against a headquarters in Tayninh
                            Province. This is a very large scale affair and, of course, comes very
                            close to the Cambodian Border which aroused <persName corresp="#p_FMV1"
                                >Forrestal</persName> because of the implications of the Cambodian
                            problems. The result was to impress those peasants with Washington’s
                            concern about the relationships with Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> raised the
                            question of this desire to overfly Laos in order to get photographs of
                            Tchepone and the buildup which he suspects is taking place there. He
                            also wants permission to probe in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Another agenda item was the operation in the Ca <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> Peninsula in which two Marine
                            battalions will be landed. This is a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            stronghold which the government has been unable to enter since 1945.
                            Additional motives for the operation are the problem of charcoal for
                            Saigon and also an attempt to cut off the export of fish from the Viet
                            Cong territory to Singapore. The Embassy has doubts about this since
                            they feel that it will tie down the two Marine battalions for many, many
                            months. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>’
                            response was to imply that the Marine battalions might not otherwise be
                            used and that it was a clear and hold operation. Other of the Embassy
                            doubts are that in the whole area of clear and hold only four strategic
                            hamlets are planned and the Embassy feels that these four will be
                            inhabited by women and children only and that they will require the
                            resettlement of people and will be in effect concentration camps. It is
                            recognized by everyone concerned that this operation is an exception to
                            the general rule.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> described several
                            clear and hold operations in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            strongholds, Phu Bon also in a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            stronghold, An Lac area also a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            stronghold. Others he mentioned as examples are Phu Yen Province, Vinh
                            Binh Province, Quang Ngai Province, and the Ben Cat area.</p>
                        <p>The question of napalm came up for discussion with the Ambassador making
                            the point that the South Vietnamese already had napalm and we could not
                            control completely their use of it. And General</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0039"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> making the point that
                            napalm really put the fear of God into the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> and was very effective. This led to a discussion of
                            Farmgate and the requested augmentation. Apparently, air strikes have
                            gone from one hundred a month to over a thousand a month partly as a
                            result of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> learning more about
                            our air power and how to use it.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> also mentioned
                            that following Tet he hoped for a nationwide intensification of <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> offensives. This is his word now for
                            the so-called explosion.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador raised the point about the Cambodian bid for neutrality
                            and his fear that this would be associated within South Vietnameses’
                            minds the desire [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for U.S. cutback in U.S.
                            presence which might come early in ‘63. The Ambassador was very fearful
                            that these two would make the South Vietnamese afraid that we were
                            getting out and seeking a neutral solution for all of Southeast Asia.
                            The Ambassador felt that this was to be handled very carefully and if it
                            caused us a break with the French, he was willing to accept that
                            cost.</p>
                        <p>I raised the question of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            inability to delegate and asked whether this was leading to frustration
                            on the part of technical and professional and bureaucratic elites. The
                            Ambassador said that he thought that there was considerably less
                            frustration both at the provincial and the national levels for three
                            reasons. First, because of our aid and the momentum that has been
                            generated these officials now have more to do than they ever did before.
                            The second, they have a plan which they understand and are following and
                            third, the mere fact of momentum lifts morale and dissipates doubts. I
                            suggested that this morale might be shortlived and due mainly to our aid
                            and participation only to emerge [<hi rend="italic">submerge</hi>?]
                            again if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s habits about
                            failing to delegate continued.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of this in which the Country Team generally
                            sided with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and said that
                            usually when he interfered he was right and the other people were wrong.
                            My net reaction was that the case was not entirely persuasive.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> and I spent four and a
                            half hours with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. It is
                            perfectly obvious that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regards these long conversations as a form of amusement. He schedules
                            them when he has plenty of free time and it is a substitute for bridge,
                            movies, music, or social evenings. He, of course, monopolizes the
                            conversation, but what it does illustrate is his very profound knowledge
                            of his own country. There is no facet of it that he does not know
                            everything about. He spoke at great length about the Montagnards of
                            which he knows a great deal. He concentrated upon the differences in the
                            different tribes and their nature, and the way they behaved, and so
                            on.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> also described in great
                            detail the recent activities of the province chief in Tay Ninh and the
                            operations there. There was a headquarters located in Tay Ninh province
                            of the Viet Cong. By accommodation [<hi rend="italic">a
                            combination</hi>?] of airdrops and sweeps on the part of civil guard and

                            rice supplies, a radio, a Viet Cong colonel and so on and so forth were
                            captured. In addition a great many Viet Cong were killed.</p>
                        <p>He also described in great detail the operations in Mackaday Zone D. This
                            is adopting the long advocated but rarely done long-range patrols by
                            ranger companies. At the time he was talking, these four or five day
                            patrols had killed a total of 108 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with
                            very few losses to themselves. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s general plans in this called for keeping the
                            reserves outside of Mackaday but to parachute or helicopter them in if
                            the long-range patrols ran into overwhelming resistance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> also had some criticisms to
                            make of the Plei Mrong operation and of our Special Forces there. His
                            major criticism was that the defense perimeter was badly planned and
                            organized. Unfortunately, I am afraid he is right.</p>

                        <p>The Farmgate now has eight B-26s, eight T-28s, four C-47s, and four
                            U-10As. The complement is 43 officers and 104 airmen. The augmentation
                            requested is for eleven B-26s, five T-28s, two C-47s, and 130 additional
                            people. The Vietnamese Air Force on the other hand has two fighter
                            squadrons; one squadron of T-28s consisting of 25 airplanes and one
                            squadron of AD-6s consisting of 25 airplanes. We had a long discussion
                            of the procedures by which targets are selected and fired. In brief,
                            there are two ways in which targets are selected. The first is through
                            the photographic interpretation route. If the American <gloss
                                target="#t_PIC1">PIC</gloss> sees a suspected area, it reports it to
                            the Vietnamese <gloss target="#t_PIC1">PIC</gloss> who on confirming
                            this gives it to corps and corps to division. The other route is if it
                            is requested by a division which then goes straight to the joint
                            operations center and a strike is laid on.</p>
                        <p>Thus the key is the division. It is the division that really decides
                            whether they will bomb a village or not. There is a US air liaison
                            officer at the division level but he does not usually participate in
                            target selection, but only in laying on a strike.</p>
                        <p>There are roughly two kinds of strikes. One is the close support, that is
                            when a unit is actually in contact with the enemy and is fired upon. No,
                            wait, there is a fallacy here. Close support is when the planes actually
                            accompany the troops. One circumstance, of course, would be when the
                            troops were fired upon and the planes were then bombed but under the
                            rubric of close support would also fall air strikes done in preparation
                            in softening up of a ground attack. (I will check on this today.)</p>
                        <p>The other kind of strike is the so-called interdiction. An interdiction
                            strike is a bombing and/or strafing run on a suspected <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> installation indicated by
                            intelligence.</p>
                        <p>There are roughly 1,000 strikes a month. In November, 32 per cent of
                            these were interdiction, 53 per cent were in direct support and 15
                            percent were other, i.e., reconnaissance and so on. Thus over 300
                            strikes per month are pure interdiction and it is unknown how many of
                            the 15-53 percent are strikes based on intelligence rather than strikes
                            on people who are actually shooting at the ground forces.</p>
                        <p>There are 63 so-called free areas which change constantly.</p>
                        <p>The request for augmentation is based really on three things. First, the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is “learning more how to use
                            air power and calling for it more.” The second is that there are nine
                            active divisions and if you total up all the odd SCSDC and civil guard
                            companies and so on, a <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0042"/>total of
                            51 divisions equivalent all of whom are calling for air support. The
                            third justification is in anticipation of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>’ “national intensification”
                            which he is planning to begin immediately following Tet. (This is what
                            we understood as explosion in the states.)</p>
                        <p>The American Air Force here is, of course, terribly sensitive on this
                            issue of “indiscriminate bombing” and really quite defensive in their
                            conversations with us. The key to the issue is, of course, intelligence
                            and this is something we will look into today.</p>

                            <item>Is there a plan? The answer is no. There are five or six plans
                                many of which are competing. There is, consequently, great
                                confusion.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>How about implementation? Are the military and political action
                                coordinated? The answer-Imperfectly at best. There are huge gaps in
                                what people are doing. For example, the police program has not even
                                begun to get off the ground, and this raises the possibility that
                                the strategic villages will be built around Communists and will rot
                                from within which could bring the whole thing down in
                                shambles.</item>

                                which permits effective meshing of our various efforts?
                                Answer—Individual agencies are doing a superb job (e.g., <persName

                                it cannot really be said that there is wide understanding of [<hi

                            <item>South Vietnam has made some military progress in its struggle with
                                the Viet Cong due largely to extensive US support. The Viet Cong,
                                however, continue to expand the size and effectiveness of their
                                forces, and are increasingly bold in their attacks. Furthermore,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s political
                                improvements have not kept pace with purely military
                                achievements.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Various statistics indicate government progress against the Viet
                                Cong during 1962, but these can be misleading as a basis for a
                                conclusion on who is winning. For instance, Viet Cong casualties
                                during 1962 were reported at more than 30,000 including some 21,000
                                killed in action. Yet current Viet Cong strength is estimated at
                                22,000-24,000 regulars, as opposed to an estimated 17,600 last June.
                                This suggests either that the casualty figures are exaggerated or
                                that the Viet Cong have a remarkable replacement capability—or
                                both.</item>

                            <item>The ratio of weapons captured to weapons lost has recently turned
                                in favor of the government. For example, in October and November,
                                the last two months for which complete statistics are available, the
                                South Vietnamese lost a total of 736 weapons and captured 860. But
                                many of the Communist weapons are old French equipment or crude
                                homemade rifles and pistols, while government losses are generally
                                modern US weapons.</item>

                            <item>The number of government strikes has certainly increased during
                                the past year. But all too frequently the Viet Cong are gone when
                                the strike force arrives. Hence, a pure count of government-mounted
                                operations may indicate a more determined government policy but not
                                necessarily a weakened enemy.</item>

                            <item>Nor is it completely safe to judge the condition of this enemy by
                                the type of operation he mounts. Widespread small-unit attacks do
                                not necessarily mean that the Viet Cong are on the defensive any
                                more than a series of battalion-size operations necessarily heralds
                                the advent of positional war. Each type of action is an integral
                                part of the strategy known as “mobile warfare”-essentially a war of
                                attrition.</item>

                            <item>The South Vietnamese, with extensive US assistance, have
                                instituted military and political measures which have had some
                                success in curbing the insurgency menace. Training has been
                                intensified, counterguerrilla tactics have been improved, and force
                                levels augmented. These, in conjunction with new US-provided or
                                operated equipment and US tactical advice, have all resulted in a
                                measure of increased effectiveness, mobility and aggressiveness on
                                the part of government forces. A recent reorganization of the
                                military command structure is designed to facilitate quicker and
                                better responses to Viet Cong military moves.</item>

                            <item>In the political sphere, various counterinsurgency projects-of

                                improved the local security situation in some areas and made some
                                    <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0047"/>progress toward
                                persuading the rural population to identify its fortunes with those

                                operations-where an effort is made to follow up a military success
                                with a political action program-have been encouraging. So too have
                                been the results of work among the Montagnards and a heterogeneous
                                variety of civilian paramilitary units known collectively as
                                Citizens Irregular Defense Groups.</item>

                            <item>The overall effectiveness of the counterinsurgency effort,
                                however, continues to be blunted by the government’s political modus
                                operandi. Assorted control measures designed to guard against
                                disloyalty in the military forces hobble their combat effectiveness.
                                Recent military appointments have removed some competent officers
                                from responsible positions and replaced them with others deemed more
                                loyal. The political danger of acting without the protection of
                                explicit orders is frequently responsible for unit commanders’
                                reluctance to exercise initiative. Provincial administration remains
                                a major weakness; in some areas counterinsurgency programs have been
                                carried out in such a way as to antagonize the peasantry further.
                                Insensitivity to real or fancied popular grievances or to issues of
                                popular interest such as corruption has done little to enhance the
                                regime’s internal image.</item>

                            <item>The Viet Cong actively exploit the government’s domestic political
                                shortcomings. The Viet Cong-controlled National Front for the
                                Liberation of South Vietnam purports to combine all shades of
                                political opinion and works vigorously to identify itself with the
                                peasantry, as do the Viet Cong troops. On 1 December 1962, 793 of
                                2,530 South Vietnamese villages were either physically held by the
                                Viet Cong or subject to their control. The government controlled
                                1,617 and the remaining 120 were not under the effective control of
                                either side. This represents a gain of 27 villages for the Viet Cong
                                since 1 October 1962 and 75 for the government. While the government
                                does seem to be showing some progress in the contest to win control
                                of the countryside, it is difficult to establish a really meaningful
                                trend because the total number of villages in South Vietnam
                                fluctuates with administrative reorganizations. In the areas

                            <item>The Communists, however, face some very serious problems. Recent
                                government operations have destroyed Viet Cong food stores and there
                                are increasing reports of low morale as a result of hunger and the
                                lack of medical facilities. This situation seems most acute among
                                Viet Cong in the highland regions. Despite their improving ability
                                to down helicopters, the Viet Cong are finding it difficult to
                                concentrate and move troops in the face of greater South Vietnamese
                                mobility. While it is difficult to assess the exact damage being
                                done by air strikes, Viet Cong prisoners have expressed the fear
                                these strikes instill in the individual guerrillas.</item>

                        <p>Early in 1962 the U.S. undertook to canvass <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> members and certain other Free World nations on
                            increased economic aid to Viet-Nam with emphasis on commercial import
                            which could provide local currency for assisted projects. Preliminary
                            soundings by Ambassador <persName>Riddleberger</persName><note n="2"

                            agreed on the political importance of Viet-Nam’s struggle, they were
                            somewhat reluctant to come forward with increased aid; especially of the
                            grant commercial import variety.</p>
                        <p>By mid-year a consensus had been reached that a proposed aid coordinating
                            group for Viet-Nam should be handled outside <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> since at this stage of <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss>’s evolution, a group on a hot point in the cold war
                            could compromise <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>’s economic
                            character. We then proposed the formation of an informal Saigon group
                            outside <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> which would have no
                            connection with the OECD body and would for the present receive no
                            publicity.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that a coordinating body should meet in Saigon which would
                            serve two main functions. First of all it would serve as a vehicle for
                            reviewing the aid contributions made by the various members and thus
                            expose duplication or areas of neglect. Secondly it would give us a
                            means to get across the financial facts of life to the other western
                            nations that had a more peripheral interest in Viet-Nam. Thirdly, it
                            would provide the necessary spadework for a later meeting of senior
                            officials from capitals that could discuss the policy issue of
                            commercial import aid for Viet-Nam. Australia, France, Germany, Italy,
                            Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom agreed to participate in the
                            Saigon Group.</p>
                        <p>Beginning August 31 three meetings of the Saigon Group have been
                                held.<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">Records of this meeting and

                            others.</p>
                        <p>At the second meeting,<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">September
                                14,1962.</note> the Australian and German Ambassadors agreed to draw
                            the attention of their governments to the desirability of paying plaster
                            costs of their project aid. The third meeting<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6"
                                >September 27,1962.</note> was more encouraging. The British
                            predicted they would provide more paramilitary aid rather than expanded
                            economic aid. The group unanimously adopted a report<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d12fn7">The report is entitled “Conclusions of the Experts

                            country. This report, while not binding the countries to its
                            conclusions, called for long term loans to cover the local currency
                            costs of sponsored projects.</p>
                        <p>The meetings in Saigon have shown a certain amount of success within the
                            limits set by the circumstances. One year ago most western countries
                            were probably quite sceptical both of South Viet-Nam’s future and our
                            commitment to it. By now they are probably reassured on both points.
                            This does not mean that they feel an obligation to increase their aid
                            significantly. Continuing efforts in Saigon, Washington, Paris, and the
                            respective capitals are required to capitalize on these earlier
                            soundings.</p>
                        <p>In October we directed our embassies to approach their host countries on
                            the possibility of financing the local currency costs of projects they
                            assist in. This was to be done without weakening our earlier stand on
                            commercial import aid. So far there has been no reported reaction to
                            this approach.</p>
                        <p>Viet-Nam was discussed briefly in December at a Far East Regional meeting
                            of <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> in Paris. Germany indicated that
                            it was considering grant commercial import financing. France claimed
                            that Viet-Nam had not made use of previous general import credits (which
                            are not grant in nature). Japan indicated that remaining reparation
                            credits should be used before additional aid is made available.</p>
                        <p>Since then we have received indications that the Australians are
                            seriously considering adopting a commercial aid program for Viet-Nam
                            including agricultural and dairy products.</p>
                        <p>In summary there are encouraging signs that Australia, Germany, Japan
                            could be moving toward a commercial import program. This possibility did
                            not exist before our efforts began a year ago. The UK will provide
                            slightly increased paramilitary aid, but is inclined to hold off on
                            anything else because of the demand for Indian aid. Italy has had no
                            experience in this area, but is showing limited interest.</p>

                        <p>During his recent visit to the Far East, Assistant Administrator

                            of the commercial aid program (such as spare parts) which are
                            particularly suitable for financing by other countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pros:</hi> 1. Jets for photo-reconnaissance are needed
                            in Viet-Nam now. This need is being filled by U.S. planes and pilots. If
                            the Vietnamese are given these planes they can then assume one of the
                            responsibilities which they will have to undertake as we phase out. Most
                            Vietnamese pilots have jet training and it is believed that they could
                            take over fairly quickly.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> also points out that since the
                            Cambodians have jets Vietnamese morale would be improved if they too had
                            these planes.</p>
                        <p>3. The six jets which <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would like to
                            give the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> have been suitably modified
                            and are now ready for delivery.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cons:</hi> 1. The Vietnamese don’t need jets now. This
                            job is being done very well by the Americans. As you remember General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> told Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in October that he
                            had everything he needed.</p>
                        <p>2. To give the Vietnamese jets would put both the United States and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in flat violation of Article 17
                            of the Geneva Accords. We could be cited for a substantive violation by
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Viet-Nam and to give the
                            Vietnamese jets might have a bad effect on our attempts to get <gloss
                                target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Laos to function more effectively. It
                            is true that we are flying jets over Viet-Nam and have been cited by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> for doing so. However, these
                            jets are under our control and can be pulled out at any moment if the
                            international situation makes it in our interest to do so.</p>
                        <p>3. If we give jets to the Vietnamese we increase the risks of border
                            violations over Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>4. Jets under Vietnamese control would be a small but significant
                            escalation in the terms of the war we are now fighting. It would give
                            the Communist countries an excuse to introduce jets into North
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>5. It is true that at some point jets should be turned over to the
                            Vietnamese as we phase out but this is far in the future.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi></p>
                        <p>Giving jets to the Vietnamese now would not increase their military
                            potential or shorten the war; it would significantly increase the risks
                            of international incidents and repercussions. It would to a significant
                            degree change the terms of the limited war which are now quite well
                            understood on both sides in Viet-Nam.</p>

                                necessary, since it was a policy question affecting U.S.
                                international relations. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_BWP1"

                                reconnaissance jets are already doing the same job.” A handwritten

                        <p>The Group discussed at length the question of relating press coverage in

                            also agreed that it might be desirable to arrange background briefings
                            for key members of Congress in the hope of heading off adverse reaction

                        <p>“I today informed the Secretary of our discussion in the Special Group
                            (C.I.) yesterday of U.S. press coverage in Viet-Nam. In addition, the
                            Secretary suggested that we have Saigon look into the possibility of
                            ‘keeping a book’ on correspondents out there for a period of perhaps two
                            weeks or so which perhaps in some way could demonstrate the present
                            apparent bias of many of them toward reporting only defeats or alleged
                            defeats and ignoring the successful operations. What the Secretary had
                            in mind was Saigon keeping track of the offers made by ourselves or the
                            Viet-Namese to the correspondents to cover successful operations and
                            constructive accomplishments and the number of these accepted by the
                            correspondents as compared with their acceptance when they sensed a less
                            successful operation. Depending on the results of such a record, we
                            could then decide what use could best be made of it.” (Department of

                        <p>The members, in general, agreed that there has been some improvement in
                            the situation in South Viet-Nam during the last year. However, this has
                            seemingly not affected the ability of the Viet Cong to maintain the size
                            of their forces through local recruitment. It was also noted that it is
                            extremely difficult to obtain significant information on the extent of
                            infiltration of personnel or supplies.</p>

                        <p>The Group agreed that progress is being made, but that much more remains
                            to be done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> discussed
                            this subject with Japanese officials during his recent trip, and also
                            with the German Ambassador in South Viet-Nam. The latter suggested that
                            it should be taken up with the German Government from the Washington
                            level. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> has asked the

                            the latter’s visit. It was agreed that the field should develop specific
                            types of assistance needed from third countries, and that Washington
                            would then contact the respective capitals to seek cooperation. State

                                                to evaluate and meet the infiltration problem is
                                                hindered by political decision to halt air and
                                                ground reconnaissance and harassment in Laos. Thus
                                                our political willingness to remain passive to these

                                            <p>The border control problem in Cambodia is essentially
                                                academic if the Laos question is not addressed.
                                                Freedom to move into Cambodia is a matter of
                                                convenience to the Viet Cong. If Laos is open,
                                                support can enter SVN-without use of Cambodian
                                                territory. If Laos borders are sealed, it should be
                                                easier politically to focus Sihanouk’s attention to
                                                the remaining and lesser problem.</p>

                            <item>The second factor is the matter of US willingness to take actions
                                to discourage further <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> support
                                for the Viet Cong. This issue also is related to strengthening
                                Souvanna control in the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. If a
                                truly neutral regime can be fostered in Laos, <gloss

                                effective route of support and the need for US pressures to dissuade
                                    <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> subversion in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would decrease. On the other hand,
                                if the Laos situation continues in its present form, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> problem sharpens. We may be faced
                                with a decision as to the relative advantages between chancing

                            <item>The last major factor is the state of the political climate in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. No amount of military
                                effort can succeed if the parallel political action program to
                                include economic and social reform is not positive and enlightened.
                                To measure this factor requires varied shades of information perhaps
                                not available. It is clear that the economic and social side is
                                getting unprecedented attention. If a responsible political
                                evaluation were made and was adverse, the question of how to achieve
                                corrective action that was not politically disruptive to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would remain. On balance, this
                                factor probably should remain secondary to the first two for the
                                time being. This may not be possible, however, because this rather
                                intangible issue that on the surface can be confronted without risk
                                of war (while the alternatives cannot) is the first target of those

                                would expect an uprising of despair. It is of vital importance that

                            <item>It is interesting that analysis of the several factors which limit

                                comes back to the matter of a neutral Laos. There is a legal base
                                for stronger political action in the Accords. Evidence exists that

                                influencing Communist moves there. What is needed is a review of the

                                through strong diplomatic pressures to avoid a long war in <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ben</hi>: During Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s recent visit, one of the
                            subjects discussed at some length was the augmentation of Farmgate. Some
                            time prior to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s
                            arrival, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, without clearing it with
                            the Embassy, requested that Farmgate be augmented by 10 B-26’s, 5 T-28’s
                            and 2 C-47’s. By the time we found out about it, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had already approved it. During Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s visit the Ambassador
                                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0059"/>pointed out this lack of

                            who expressed surprise that the Embassy had not been consulted and said
                            he would ask his staff to coordinate with the Embassy on such matters in
                            the future. Because the Farmgate augmentation in question was of limited
                            size, and therefore appeared to have no serious political implications,
                            the Ambassador concurred in it ex post facto.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we learned that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            had informed <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> that it was

                            without a significantly increased US commitment in Viet-Nam. The Admiral
                            also informed <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> that, in endorsing
                            the latter’s first Farmgate augmentation request, he had felt obliged to
                            state to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that there would be no
                            additional similar requests. He asked <gloss target="#t_MACV1"
                                >MACV</gloss> to study the matter further in light of his views, and
                            to tailor its request accordingly. He agreed to receive the request but
                            did not commit himself to it.</p>
                        <p>After the Admiral’s departure, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            consulted the Embassy. The Ambassador said he could go along with a

                            and Caribous) if in General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"

                            meet the increased requirements of the “National Campaign.” (As you will
                            note from a message<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">Not found.</note> through

                            Ambassador took a firm stand against the additional strike aircraft
                            (B-26’s and T-28’s), using the same arguments that Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> had used and, in addition,
                            expressing concern that a request of such size for additional strike
                            aircraft could raise political questions at home regarding the soundness
                            of the Administration’s policy in Viet-Nam and the ground rules under
                            which we are operating here. In light of the views of Admiral <persName

                            and will seek the Ambassador’s concurrence on any request going to

                                <item>Increases in costs throughout the plan years are generally
                                    attributable to the earlier acquisition of major items of
                                    material, increased usage rates, and to the costs of intensified
                                    training programs. The additional material costs are
                                    particularly evident in the Air Force program as a result of the
                                    earlier acquisition of aircraft and the increased aircraft
                                    flying hour authorizations. Increased training ammunition
                                    requirements are due to the training program placing increased
                                    emphasis on completing required courses; increased availability
                                    of trainees; and, in the later plan years, an extensive
                                    replacement training program.</item>

                            The government claims to have built more than 4,000 Strategic Hamlets,
                            and although many of these are nothing more than a bamboo fence, a
                            certain proportion have enough weapons to keep out at least small Viet
                            Cong patrols and the rudiments of the kind of social and political
                            program needed to enlist the villagers’ support.</p>
                        <p>The program to arm and train the Montagnards, which should go far toward
                            choking off the infiltration routes, has also made progress. There are
                            29 U.S. Special Forces teams training Montagnards (as well as certain
                            minority groups in the Delta), with eleven more teams on the way. By
                            mid-autumn training camps had been set up in all the provinces bordering
                            Laos, and a system of regular patrolling started <pb n="50"
                                xml:id="pg_50" facs="0076"/>that hopefully will one day cover the
                            entire network of trails in the mountain regions. Under this program
                            over 35,000 Montagnards have been trained, armed, and assisted in
                            setting up their village defenses, the eventual goal being one hundred
                            thousand.</p>
                        <p>In both the mountain regions and the heavily populated lowlands, the
                            areas through which one can travel without escort have been enlarged. In
                            contested areas, the government is beginning to probe out, gradually
                            repairing the roads and bridges cut by the Viet Cong as they go. In some
                            of the moderately populated areas fringing the Delta and the coastal
                            plain, as for example Binh Duong province, isolated villages have been
                            bodily moved to positions along the roads where they can be more easily
                            defended.</p>
                        <p>As of December 1, the Vietnamese government controlled 951 villages
                            containing about 51% of the rural population—a gain of 92 villages and
                            500,000 people in six months. The Viet Cong control 445 villages with 8%
                            of the rural population-a loss of 9 villages and 231,000 people in six
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The impact of previously authorized U.S. aid programs is also beginning
                            to be felt. On the military side, U.S. advisors, helicopters, air
                            support, and arms have given the Vietnamese military new confidence
                            which they are showing by increased aggressiveness. For the first time
                            since the war began in 1959, for example, the government forces began in
                            September to capture more weapons than they lost. From January to
                            August, government forces captured 2,728 weapons but lost 3,661. But in
                            September and October, they captured 908 weapons and lost only 765.</p>
                        <p>On the Strategic Hamlet and civilian programs. U.S. aid is just coming
                            in. Strategic Hamlet “kits” are now arriving, a U.S. military advisor
                            has been stationed with each province chief, and twenty of the forty-one
                            provinces will soon have a U.S. Rural Development advisor as well.
                            Finally there is considerably more optimism among Vietnamese officials
                            than there was a year ago, although it is probably based more on the
                            visible flow of U.S. aid than on an objective analysis of actual
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong, in sum, are being hurt—they have somewhat less freedom of
                            movement than they had a year ago, they apparently suffer acutely from
                            lack of medicines, and in some very isolated areas they seem to be
                            having trouble getting food.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Qualifications</hi></p>
                        <p>Even so, the negative side of the ledger is still awesome. The Viet Cong
                            continue to be aggressive and are extremely effective. In the last few
                            weeks, for example, they fought stubbornly and with telling results at
                            Ap Bac, near My Tho. They completely escaped an elaborate trap in Tay
                            Ninh province. They fought their way inside the perimeter <pb n="51"
                                xml:id="pg_51" facs="0077"/>of a U.S. Special Forces training camp
                            at Plei Mrong, killing 39 of the trainee defenders and capturing 114
                            weapons. And they completely overran a strategic hamlet in Phu Yen
                            province that was defended by a civil guard company in addition to the
                            village militia, killing 24 of the defenders and capturing 35
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>Probably even more significant are the figures on Viet Cong strength.
                            Intelligence estimates credit the Viet Cong with actually increasing
                            their regular forces from 18,000 to 23,000 over this past year in spite
                            of having suffered what the government claims were losses of 20,000
                            kil1ed in action and 4,000 wounded. Part of this increase may result
                            from nothing more than better intelligence, but even so it is ominous
                            that in the face of greatly increased government pressure and U.S.
                            support the Viet Cong can still field 23,000 regular forces and 100,000
                            militia, supported by unknown thousands of sympathizers.</p>
                        <p>What these figures suggest is that the Viet Cong are still able to obtain
                            an adequate supply of recruits and the large quantities of food and
                            other supplies they need from the villagers of South Vietnam itself.
                            Infiltration by sea has been effectively blocked since early in 1962. As
                            for infiltration by land, captured documents, POW interrogation,
                            evidence gathered by patrolling, and other intelligence indicates that
                            3,000 to 4,000 Viet Cong at the most have come over the so-called
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> trails since
                            January, 1962. As to supplies, there seems to be no doubt that the
                            trails have so far been used only for specialized equipment, such as
                            radios; for medicines; and perhaps for a few automatic weapons, although
                            no weapons have yet been captured which could be proved to have been
                            brought in after 1954. Thus the conclusion seems inescapable that the
                            Viet Cong could continue the war effort at the present level, or perhaps
                            increase it, even if the infiltration routes were completely closed.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Villagers’ Attitudes</hi></p>
                        <p>The question that this conclusion raises—and the basic question of the
                            whole war—is again the attitude of the villagers. It is difficult, if
                            not impossible, to assess how the villagers really feel and the only
                            straws in the wind point in different directions. The village defenders
                            in many of the strategic hamlets that have been attacked have resisted
                            bravely. But in an unknown, but probably large number of strategic
                            hamlets, the villagers have merely let the Viet Cong in or supplied what
                            they wanted without reporting the incident to the authorities. There is
                            apparently some resentment against the Viet Cong about the “taxes” they
                            collect and suspicion based on the stories the villagers hear about what
                            is going on in the North. But there may be just as much resentment and
                            suspicion directed towards the government. No one really knows, for
                            example, how many of the 20,000 “Viet Cong” killed last year were only
                            innocent, or at least persuadable villagers, <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52"
                                facs="0078"/>whether the Strategic Hamlet program is providing
                            enough government services to counteract the sacrifices it requires, or
                            how the mute mass of villagers react to the charges against <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> of dictatorship and nepotism. At
                            the very least, the figures on Viet Cong strength imply a continuing
                            flow of recruits and supplies from these same villages and indicate that
                            a substantial proportion of the population is still cooperating with the
                            enemy, although it is impossible to tell how much of this cooperation
                            stems from fear and how much from conviction. Thus on the vital question
                            of villagers’ attitudes, the net impression is one of some encouragement
                            at the progress in building strategic hamlets and the number that resist
                            when attacked, but encouragement overlaid by a shadow of uneasiness.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi></p>
                        <p>Our overall judgment, in sum, is that we are probably winning, but
                            certainly more slowly than we had hoped. At the rate it is now going the
                            war will last longer than we would like, cost more in terms of both
                            lives and money than we anticipated, and prolong the period, in which a
                            sudden and dramatic event would upset the gains already made.</p>
                        <p>The question is where improvements can be made-whether in our basic
                            approach to fighting a guerrilla war, or in the implementation of that
                            approach.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The Strategic Concept</hi></p>
                        <p>We feel that the basic strategic concept developed last year is still
                            valid. As mentioned above, the Viet Cong have gotten trained cadre and
                            specialized equipment from the North, but the vast bulk of both recruits
                            and supplies come from inside South Vietnam itself. Thus the strategic
                            objectives of the war in South Vietnam, as in most guerrilla wars, are
                            basically political—not simply to kill Viet Cong, but to win the people.
                            Although the strategic concept has never been spelled out in any one
                            document, the consensus seems to be that it consists of the following
                            objectives: (1) to create the incentive for resistance in the basic
                            population by providing for a flow upward of information on villagers’
                            needs and a flow downward of government services, and by knitting them
                            into the fabric of community decision-making; (2) to provide the basic
                            population with the means and training for resistance; and (3) to cut
                            the guerrillas’ access to the villagers, their true line of
                            communications, by essentially police-type measures for controlling the
                            movement of goods and people. In this context, the military objectives
                            are also threefold: (1) to protect installations vital to the economy
                            and government; (2) to provide rapid reinforcement for villages under
                                <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0079"/>heavy attack; and (3) to keep
                            the <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> guerrilla units off balance and
                            prevent them from concentrating by aggressive but highly discriminating
                            and selective offensive military operations.</p>
                        <p>This combination of civilian and military measures is designed to reduce
                            the guerrillas to their die-hard nucleus and isolate them in areas
                            remote from the basic population. Only when this is done does the task
                            finally become one of killing Viet Cong, of simple elimination.</p>
                        <p>As we say, this concept seems sound. For, even though it is difficult to
                            assess the attitudes of the villager, two assumptions seem reasonable.
                            The first is that the villagers will be prudently cooperative with the
                            Viet Cong if they are not given physical security, both in the military
                            sense of security from attacks on their village and in the police sense
                            of security from the individual acts of terror and retaliation. The
                            second is that if the villagers are in fact politically apathetic, as
                            they seem to be, they are likely to remain so or even become
                            pro-Communist if the government does not show concern for their welfare
                            in the way it conducts the war and in the effort it makes to provide at
                            least simple government services. It may be that these measures will not
                            be enough to create popular support for the government and the incentive
                            to resist, but it seems obvious that support could neither be created
                            nor long maintained without them.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Implementing the Concept</hi></p>
                        <p>Thus it is in the implementation of the strategic concept that there
                            seems to be the greatest room for improvement. Success requires, first,
                            full understanding of the strategy at all levels of the government and
                            armed forces, and, second, the skills and organization for effective
                            coordination of military activities with civilian activities. Some parts
                            of the Vietnamese government do understand the strategy, but in other
                            parts the understanding is imperfect at best. The same is true of the
                            necessary skills and organization. Specific areas in particular need of
                            improvement are listed in the paragraphs below, which discuss both
                            programs and continuing issues and conclude with a proposal as to how
                            the United States might increase its leverage on the Vietnamese
                            government so as to bring the improvements about.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Lack of an Overall Plan</hi></p>
                        <p>The most serious lack in South Vietnam is that of an overall plan, keyed
                            to the strategic concept described above, through which priorities can
                            be set and the coordination of military and civilian activities
                            accomplished. In spite of U.S. urgings there is still no single
                            countrywide plan worthy of the name but only a variety of regional and
                            provincial plans, some good and some not so good. There are, for
                            example, a number of special plans—the Delta Plan, Operation Sunrise,
                                <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0080"/>Operation Sea Swallow, Waves
                            of Love—; several plans developed by the commanders of the Corps and
                            Divisional areas; and an unknown number of plans developed by each of
                            the forty-one province chiefs. Regional and provincial plans are, of
                            course necessary, but they should be elements of a country-wide plan
                            rather than a substitute for it. As it is, the impression is strong that
                            many of these plans are both inconsistent and competitive.</p>

                        <p>One result of the lack of an overall plan is the proliferation of
                            strategic hamlets that are inadequately equipped and defended, or that
                            are built prematurely in exposed areas.</p>

                        <p>The second result is that essential aspects of the strategy are
                            neglected. The police program is an example. An effective police system
                            is vital to guard against Communists remaining inside strategic hamlets,
                            and to man the checkpoints and patrols that are essential in,
                            controlling the movements of goods and people. The present police’
                            system is clearly inadequate, and although the Public Safety Division of
                            U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has put forward a proposal for
                            expansion, no action has yet been taken.</p>

                        <p>A third result is what appears to be an extremely uneconomic use of
                            manpower. There is in South Vietnam a confusing multiplicity of separate
                            armies. In addition to the regular forces (the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1"
                                >ARVN</gloss>), there are under arms the Civil Guard, the Self
                            Defense Corps, the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (<gloss
                                target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>), the Hamlet Militia, the Montagnard
                            Commandoes, the Force Populaire, the Republican Youth, the Catholic
                            Youth, several independent groups under parish priests, such as Father
                            Hoa’s Sea Swallows, and even one small army trained, armed, and
                            commanded by a private businessman to protect his properties in Cap St.
                            Jacques. All these forces add up to almost half a million men under
                            arms, a number which if so organized would come to the astounding total
                            of 51 divisions.</p>
                        <p>This multiplicity of separate armies results not only in an uneconomic
                            use of manpower, but also difficulties in coordination and confusion as
                            to function. One also suspects that it is a misallocation of manpower as
                            well, with too much emphasis on military activities and not enough on
                            civilian such as government services to the villages and police work. So
                            many armed men with different loyalties will also create problems in the
                            transition to a peace-time economy if victory is in fact won, as well as
                            the obvious danger that one or another chief <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55"
                                facs="0081"/>will use the forces under his command for political
                            purposes. South Vietnam does not need any more armed men, but it does
                            need to reorganize what it has.</p>

                        <p>Still another result of the lack of an overall plan are the difficulties
                            in coordinating military and civilian activities. One example is the
                            proportion of “clear and hold” as opposed to “hit and withdraw”
                            operations. There are no statistics available, but a number of American
                            military advisors feel that the proportion of “clear and hold”
                            operations, in which troops clear an area and then remain to protect the
                            civic action teams and villagers while they build strategic hamlets, is
                            too low in proportion to the “hit and withdraw” operations designed to
                            destroy regular Viet Cong units. The latter type of operation is
                            essential to keep the Viet Cong off balance and to prevent their
                            concentrating for large-scale attacks, but it should be subordinate to
                            the systematic expansion of secure areas.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Amnesty Program</hi></p>
                        <p>A final result of the lack of an overall plan, or perhaps of imperfect
                            understanding of an effective counter-guerrilla strategy, is the
                            Vietnamese reluctance to embark on a meaningful amnesty program. After
                            much U.S. urging, the Vietnamese have finally developed a plan, but it
                            is far from satisfactory. The basic trouble is revealed by the
                            Vietnamese insistence that what they want is not an “amnesty” policy but
                            a “surrender” policy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Civil Programs</hi></p>
                        <p>The inadequacies in the police program, the tendency to build strategic
                            hamlets in exposed places with inadequate arms and equipment, and the
                            reluctance to develop a meaningful amnesty program have already been
                            discussed. Other inadequacies in civilian programs are discussed
                            below.</p>
                        <p>One continuing problem is the failure of the Vietnamese government to
                            organize its economy on an emergency basis. A resistance to deficit
                            spending and stricter controls has permitted too large a part of the
                            country’s internal and external resources to go to nonessential
                            purposes, especially in the Saigon area.</p>
                        <p>There should be more planning for what the Vietnamese economy will be
                            like after the shooting has ended. There is almost none of this kind of
                            planning now, and some of the things being done today might make
                            sensible planning in the future very difficult. An obvious example is
                            the rise of consumption levels, especially in non-essential <pb n="56"
                                xml:id="pg_56" facs="0082"/>imports which Vietnam could not buy
                            without U.S. aid. At some point, and probably soon, the U.S. should
                            undertake a long-range economic study of the country’s future
                            development.</p>

                                Aspects</hi></p>
                        <p>The opinion of some American military advisors that the proportion of
                            “clear and hold” offensive operations is too low in relation to “hit and
                            withdraw” operations designed to keep the Viet Cong off balance has
                            already been mentioned. Another aspect of military operations that may
                            have political consequences is the tactics used in the offensive
                            operations needed to keep the Viet Cong off balance. Some American
                            military advisors feel that the Vietnamese have a bias toward elaborate,
                            set-piece operations. These large-scale operations provide insurance
                            against defeat, but they are expensive, cumbersome, and difficult to
                            keep secret. From the political point of view they have the additional
                            disadvantages for the Vietnamese of maximizing the chances of killing
                            civilians and from the American point of view of requiring a very heavy
                            use of helicopters.</p>
                        <p>An alternative, and apparently effective way of keeping the regular Viet
                            Cong off balance is long-range patrolling by small units, such as Ranger
                            companies. In this tactic, the patrols, resupplied by air, stay out in
                            the field for extended periods of time, never sleeping two nights in the
                            same place, ambushing, and in general using guerrilla tactics to fight
                            the guerrilla. The remaining forces are kept in reserve for rapid
                            reinforcement and sealing off an area when the patrol encounters
                            resistance. Although American military advisors in South Vietnam have
                            worked hard to overcome Vietnamese reluctance to operate for extended
                            periods in the field and at night, which would permit greater use of
                            this tactic, they have had only partial success. (Paradoxically,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> spent a
                            substantial part of his four and a half hour lecture to us praising a
                            province chief who has used the long-range patrol tactic to very good

                        <p>On use of air power, and the danger of adverse political effects, our
                            impression is that the controls over air strikes and the procedures for
                            checking intelligence against all possible sources are excellent. In
                            spite of this, however, it is difficult to be sure that air power is
                            being used in a way that minimizes the adverse political effects. U.S.
                            Air Force advisors tell us that the demand for air strikes from the
                            South Vietnamese has gone up enormously. There are now 1,000 strikes per
                            month, and there would be considerably more if the air power were
                            available. During November, thirty-two per cent of these 1,000 strikes
                                <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0083"/>were so-called
                            “interdiction”—that is, attacks on installations located in air photos
                            and identified as Viet Cong by intelligence. Fifty-three per cent of the
                            air strikes during November were in direct support that is, bombing and
                            strafing in advance of an attack on a location intelligence indicated as
                            being occupied by Viet Cong or in response to a request by a ground unit
                            in contact with the enemy. Fifteen per cent were other kinds of mission,
                            such as reconnaissance. There is no doubt that the Viet Cong fear air
                            attacks and that some interdiction is necessary and useful. On the other
                            hand, it is impossible to assess how much resentment among persuadable
                            villagers is engendered by the inevitable accidents. In general, the
                            final judgment probably lies in the answer to the questions raised above
                            about the relative emphasis on “clear and hold” and long-range
                            patrolling versus “hit and withdraw” of the more elaborate type. If the
                            proportion is correct between extending control and the necessary
                            offensive operations to keep the Viet Cong off balance, then the killing
                            of civilians is probably at an unavoidable minimum. If the proportion of
                            “hit and withdraw” is too high in relation to “clear and hold”, on the
                            other hand, then air power, too, is probably being overused in ways that
                            have adverse political consequences.</p>

                            quicker reinforcement for strategic hamlets under attack. Some American
                            military advisors feel that more attention should be paid to ways of
                            providing quicker reinforcement for the hamlets, including air support,
                            although in the case of air support there are formidable problems of
                            communications and in providing airfields close enough to threatened
                            villages.</p>

                            in foreign affairs which is dangerous for both Vietnam and for the U.S.
                            There has been massive resistance to U.S. suggestions on policies for
                            cooperation in other problems in the area, i.e. Laos and Cambodia. To
                            some extent this is unavoidable in view of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                            criticized for being a dictatorship. This is true, but we doubt that the

                            affects their attitudes <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0084"/>toward
                            the war. The real question is whether the concentration of power in the

                            especially Brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and his

                            government must depend to carry out its policies. Our judgment is that
                            the United States does not really have as much information on this
                            subject as it should. All that can be said at the moment is that it is
                            the feeling of Americans in contact with these officials that they are
                            encouraged by U.S. aid and apparently getting on with the job. Both the
                            American and British missions, for example, feel that Brother <persName

                            evidence to contradict these judgments that we found was in a

                                    >Diem</persName>’s Press Relations</hi></p>
                        <p>The American press in South Vietnam now has good relations with the
                            Embassy and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and generally are
                            grateful for the help that they have received. But their attitude toward
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the government of
                            South Vietnam is the complete opposite, and with much justice. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> wants only adulation and is
                            completely insensitive to the desires of the foreign press for factual
                            information. He is equally insensitive to his own image, the political
                            consequences of the activities of <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName> and the other members of his family, and his own
                            tendencies of arbitrariness, failure to delegate, and general pettiness.
                            After much effort, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> persuaded <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> to let the Defense Ministry give regular military
                            briefings. True to form, however, the content of the briefings is
                            deplorable. One of these briefings, for example, the transcript of which
                            we examined, contained little more than a saccharine eulogy of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>It would be nice if we could say that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s image in the foreign press was only his affair,
                            but [<hi rend="italic">it</hi>] seriously affects the U.S. and its
                            ability to help South Vietnam. The American press representatives are
                            bitter and will seize on anything that goes wrong and blow it up as much
                            as possible. The My <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            operation, for example, contained some mistakes, but it was not nearly
                            the botched up disaster that the press made it appear to be.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Action for the United States</hi></p>
                        <p>By way of summary, then, we feel that the United States should push the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government harder on
                            the need for an overall plan, on a reduction in the number of different
                            military organizations, on foreign policy questions in which the United
                            States has an interest, on an <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0085"
                            />effective police program, for a greater emphasis on military
                            operations in extending and securing government control as opposed to
                            large-scale offensives and air interdiction, on a meaningful amnesty
                            program, on planning for the post-war economy, and on a realistic effort
                            to get a more favorable press.</p>
                        <p>On many of these issues, of course, the United States has already been
                            pressing. Thus in one sense the question is how to increase our leverage
                            in the face of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s biases and
                            general resistance to advice.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the United States is in a much better position to see that its
                            advice is taken than it was a year ago. At that time <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and officials at the national
                            level were practically the only point of contact the U.S. had with
                            either civil or military programs. Today, however, the U.S. has military
                            advisors not only at the lower levels of the Army but with each province
                            chief and steps are being taken to put U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> advisors in at least 20 of the 41 provinces. It
                            therefore is becoming possible to accomplish much of what we want at the
                            local level without going through the vastly inefficient national
                            bureaucracy. An example is the work of the special forces teams. They
                            work at the village level, and at a number of places have done wonders
                            not only in training and supervising the erection of village defenses
                            but also in medical aid, school construction, and even in agriculture
                            and marketing.</p>
                        <p>In general, it is our judgment that an effort should be made to increase
                            this influence at the local level even more by putting additional
                                U.S.<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> people with province chiefs
                            and, where it is indicated, even at selected places further down in the
                            civilian hierarchy.</p>
                        <p>In addition, having gotten past the first year of increased U.S. support
                            and demonstrated our sincerity, the time has probably come when we can
                            press our views on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> more
                            vigorously and occasionally even publicly.</p>
                        <p>One final recommendation for U.S. action concerns our dealings with the
                            press here in Washington. In our judgment a systematic campaign to get
                            more of the facts into the press and T.V. should be mounted. Although
                            our report, for example, is not rosily optimistic, it certainly contains
                            the factual basis (e.g., the first few paragraphs) for a much more
                            hopeful view than the pessimistic (and factually inaccurate) picture
                            conveyed in the press.</p>

                                apply to the Americans, the following in particular: <list>

                                    <item>There is no overall planning effort that effectively ties

                                    <item>There is little or no long-range thinking about the kind

                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Among both civilians and military there is still some
                                        confusion over the way to conduct a counter-guerrilla war.
                                        Many of the lower-ranking people out in the field in actual
                                        contact with the problems seem fully conscious of the
                                        importance of the civil and political aspects, but in the
                                        middle and higher levels understanding is far from perfect.
                                        The American military mission must share some of the blame
                                        for the excessive emphasis on large-scale operations and air
                                        interdiction which have the bad political and useless
                                        military effects described in our report.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>In general, we don’t use all the leverage we have to
                                        persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to
                                        adopt policies which we espouse. On foreign policy matters
                                        the U.S. mission has failed to press U.S. interests
                                        sufficiently hard, possibly because it is easier to
                                        concentrate on in-country operations. In domestic politics,
                                        we have virtually no contact with meaningful opposition
                                        elements and we have made no attempt to maintain a U.S.
                                        position independent of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                                        attitude on public policies we disapprove of, more U.S.
                                        support of people like <persName corresp="#p_BH1"

                                </list></p>
                            <p>The real trouble, however, is that the rather large U.S. effort in
                                South Vietnam is managed by a multitude of independent U.S. agencies
                                and people with little or no overall direction. No one man is in
                                charge. What coordination there is results mainly from the sort of
                                treaty arrangements that are arrived at in the Country Team meetings
                                and from an inter-agency committee chaired by the Deputy Chief of
                                Mission, which limits itself to provincial rehabilitation. The
                                result is that the U.S. effort, although massive, is fragmented and
                                duplicative. An example is the chronic shortage of weapons for
                                strategic hamlet defenders. There are more than enough weapons in
                                the country, but <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0087"/>they get
                                lost in Vietnamese government depots. The full effort of the
                                American community is rarely concentrated on breaking such
                                bottlenecks.</p>
                            <p>What is needed, ideally, is to give authority to a single, strong
                                executive, a man perhaps with a military background but who
                                understands that this war is essentially a struggle to build a
                                nation out of the chaos of revolution. One possibility would be to
                                appoint the right kind of general as Ambassador. An alternative
                                would be to appoint as Ambassador a civilian public figure whose
                                character and reputation would permit him to dominate the
                                representatives of all other departments and agencies.</p>
                            <p>There are, of course, some formidable political and bureaucratic
                                problems in taking either of these steps. What is more, we cannot
                                say that the matter is urgent or that disaster will inevitably or
                                immediately follow if things remain as they are. Progress toward
                                winning the war is being made under the present setup-although, as
                                we have said, it will take longer than expected, cost more, and
                                prolong the period in which a dramatic event could wipe out the
                                gains already made. On balance, our recommendation would be not to
                                make any sudden and dramatic change, but to keep the problem in mind
                                when changes are made in the normal course.</p>
                            <p>Certain specific problems concerning the U.S. Mission are dealt with
                                in the numbered paragraphs below.</p>

                                    we would suggest delaying approval until we could be sure that
                                    progress had been made on the problems of emphasis between
                                    “clear and hold” operations on the one hand and “hit and
                                    withdraw” and “interdiction” operations on the other. Any such
                                    request should also be reviewed from the standpoint of whether
                                    adequate close support and liaison air capability is being

                                <item>The U.S. military has still not solved the communications
                                    problem in South Vietnam, especially ground-to-air
                                    communications, but including ground-to-ground communications.
                                    When the Special Forces at Plei Mrong were attacked, it was
                                    several hours before air <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0088"
                                    />support could be brought to bear. Despite the program to equip
                                    strategic hamlets with radios, of which over 2,000 have already
                                    been distributed, the strategic hamlets still have trouble
                                    obtaining reinforcements, and especially air support. Partly
                                    this is a problem of peculiar electromagnetic conditions in
                                    South Vietnam, which should yield to research and development
                                    efforts. In the main, however, it results from inadequate
                                    procedures for calling in air power and directing it by local
                                    people who know the terrain and targets.</item>

                                <item>In U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, the effort seems
                                    to be divided between the Deputy in charge of Rural Development,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName>, and
                                    the more conventional <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                                    activities. <persName corresp="#p_PRC1">Phillips</persName> is
                                    coming close to running a practical program, but so far is
                                    operating meaningfully in only half the provinces. This rural
                                    development program, which is essentially the civic side of the
                                    strategic hamlet program, is the cutting edge of the U.S. effort
                                    at the village level. It needs to be expanded and given more
                                    flexibility and quicker support than the <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                        >AID</gloss> agency normally can give under present
                                    circumstances. The remainder of the <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                        >AID</gloss> activities seem confined to administering the
                                    commodity import program and the vestiges of earlier projects.
                                    What is most lacking here is an economic program for Vietnam
                                    designed both to support the present war effort and lay the
                                    basis for future development of the country when peace is
                                    restored.</item>

                                <item>A decision has been reached to transfer from <gloss
                                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to the Army the training of
                                    certain paramilitary groups including the Montagnards. This is
                                    known as “Operation Switchback”. The Agency is making a sincere
                                    effort to carry out this decision, but serious difficulties are
                                    arising from the Army’s rather inflexible budgetary and
                                    personnel procedures. These programs require unconventional
                                    disbursements of local currency, rapid air delivery of
                                    specialized equipment and rapid construction of storage
                                    facilities. The Army may eventually work these problems out; but
                                    in the meantime the program should not be allowed to slacken at
                                    this critical point. “Operation Switchback” should be extended,
                                    if necessary.</item>

                            As I recall, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>
                            indicated his feeling that we are not sufficiently aware of opposition
                            activities. I said that State Department personnel are not permitted to
                            maintain contacts with known oppositionists, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines

                            there was a long discussion about U.S. press coverage of Viet-Nam. The
                            feeling of the group was that, although our policies were correct in
                            Viet-Nam you would never know it from the press coverage of Viet-Nam in
                            this country. I was charged by the <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>

                                    reactions. Unfortunately, the President still has the memorandum
                                    and he has not reacted, although I have jogged Pierre a couple

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Fritz</hi>: I can imagine that the flood of
                            unfavorable news stories about the helicopter operation of January
                                2-3<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref target="#d1">Document

                            those stories alleging that American military spokesmen made such
                            statements as, “It was a miserable damn performance.” I know that press
                            relations is one of your biggest headaches.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this letter is to explore with you what further steps can
                            be taken in Saigon &amp; Washington to improve the situation. I realize
                            that a great deal has been done by you and your able <gloss
                                target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">John
                                Mecklin</persName>, but more objective reporting in the U.S. press
                            is of great importance. I know I don’t have to emphasize to you the need
                            for support and understanding at home for the expensive, continuing and
                            sometimes dangerous programs which we are carrying out in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I suggest we take a look at the problem under three heads: the handling
                            of foreign journalists by the Vietnamese Government; critical statements
                            made by American advisers in the heat of battle; and the amount of news
                            that American officials themselves should make available to U.S.
                            journalists in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>As to Vietnamese briefings of the press and restrictions on the press,
                            there does not seem to be much chance of an adequate improvement. You
                            have done a great deal to encourage the Vietnamese to tell their story
                            of their war and should continue to do so. However, since this is also a
                            war which involves very important American policies, commitments and
                            risk to American personnel, the American public has a right to the best
                            possible American information even if this does <pb n="68"
                                xml:id="pg_68" facs="0094"/>offend Vietnamese sensitivities. It is
                            for you to decide whether this should be explained to the Vietnamese or
                            whether we should simply take the initiative to increase our briefings
                            and contacts.</p>
                        <p>As to the U.S. military policy towards the press, I have noted the
                            excellent guidance which General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> gave to American military advisers on press
                            relations (Airgram 327, December 19<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">Not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                            751K.5/12-1962)</note>).1 think the ground rules which he set forth
                            should certainly help the American advisers in their contacts with the
                            press. In order to further clarify this situation I would suggest that
                            all American correspondents while on operations with United States
                            forces might well be clearly identified by a name tag or by other means.
                            I think the most damaging aspect of our press problem is alleged quotes
                            of American military advisers criticizing their Vietnamese comrades in
                            arms. Nothing could be more destructive of the cooperation we must have
                            with the Vietnamese or more helpful to the Communist propagandists. I
                            know this is difficult to lick. However, I was glad to learn that the
                            new <gloss target="#t_PIO1">PIO</gloss>, Colonel Bazil L. Baker, who
                            will be coming to Saigon as Colonel <persName>Smith</persName>’s tour
                            comes to an end, is highly regarded. I would recommend that more
                            assistant <gloss target="#t_PIO1">PIO</gloss>’s be sent to Saigon so
                            that journalists may be given better service and coverage in their
                            contacts with our military personnel in the field. Also, I would like to
                            know what is done to explain to U.S. personnel the importance of not
                            insulting the Vietnamese publicly. We are guests in their house and we
                            have come to help them. I believe this simple point might be reiterated
                            frequently to our official personnel in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I want to encourage you, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName>, and such other responsible members of your
                            staff as you think appropriate, to increase your official and informal
                            contacts with the American press. I know that you do this kind of thing
                            very well and even if there is no hard news to give, regular contacts
                            with you will enable the correspondents to vent some of their
                            frustrations, which in itself will be helpful. If the official Americans
                            can take the initiative in providing the press promptly with the facts
                            and with sufficient perspective, we are likely to get a good result in
                            the long run. However, I would caution against over-optimistic
                            statements to the press and to public officials. This will be a long
                            struggle, with many frustrations. (Senator Mansfield’s report<note n="4"

                        <p>In Washington I understand that action is being taken to see that
                            returning officials, such as General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1"
                                >Wheeler</persName>, are given the opportunity to tell the press and
                            public how things are going in Viet-Nam. Obviously, one problem is that,
                            although this is a Vietnamese war, the stories the U.S. press are
                            interested in are largely about Americans. The success stories of
                            Vietnamese operations have little U.S. news value, whereas the setbacks
                            involving planes shot down with U.S. casualties, are headline material.
                            Attempts will be made here to encourage experienced reporters to go to
                            Viet-Nam and write stories about their overall observations. Through
                            these feature articles, perhaps a better and more accurate understanding
                            of the war can be obtained.</p>

                            we can win in five years we will be doing twice as well as was done in
                            the others. The British knew they would win in Malaya in 1951 but did
                            not achieve preponderant control for four years. We will be doing well
                            if by the end of 1963 there are enough indications for us to say we can
                            win.</p>

                        <p>Comment: Our own strength also grew during 1962. The ratio of Vietnamese
                            military and paramilitary to Viet Cong military and paramilitary (i.e.,
                            all forces of both sides) was 2-1/2 to 1 in our favor at the end of
                            1961. It has now grown to 3-1/2 to 1 in our favor, still a narrow margin
                            in terms of the 10 to 1 or 20 to 1 cited as being necessary in the
                            textbooks. However, our side has tremendous strength in men and

                            help the Vietnamese Government to obtain a position where it is
                            recognized as being predominantly sovereign over its own national

                                program in South Vietnam. The team was asked to form a military
                                judgment as to the prospects for a successful conclusion of the
                                conflict in a reasonable period of time. Specific appraisals were
                                requested on the effectiveness of the present military program to
                                meet United States objectives in South Vietnam, to include: the
                                command and control arrangements of the United States and indigenous
                                military forces in Southeast Asia; effectiveness of employment of
                                United States and indigenous aviation; the quality and validity of
                                military intelligence; and the readiness of plans to meet
                                contingencies in the area. The team was to submit recommendations
                                for modifications to our program which appeared to be desirable.

                        <p>The team approached its visit with the knowledge that the Vietnam war has
                            been in progress for fifteen years, during which the insurgents have not
                            allowed the young country the opportunity to pursue its nation-building
                            program. Despite this, the government has managed to survive. The team’s
                            assessment of progress achieved, and programs required, was made in
                            light of the strong nationalistic convictions of the Government of
                            Vietnam. These convictions limit the role of the United States to one of
                            advice and persuasion, supplemented only by the metering effect of our
                            material assistance. Finally, the team was mindful of the fact that, in
                            a counterinsurgency campaign, there are few major judgments that are
                            wholly military. Decisions, particularly in the campaign in Vietnam,
                            usually embrace political, economic, and ideological factors as well.
                            The team’s study and conclusions were influenced by this fact.</p>

                                1962, the number of U.S. advisors with the Vietnamese military was
                                tripled, rising from 900 to over 3,000. At the beginning of the
                                year, there were no advisors where the bulk of the fighting takes
                                place, at the battalion level. At year’s end, there were over 400
                                serving with every battalion and comparable unit in the Vietnamese
                                armed forces. Likewise, the number of U.S. advisors with province
                                chiefs grew from two in January 1962, to over 100 in December 1962,
                                while the system of intelligence advisors expanded nearly tenfold
                                from 25, at the beginning of the year, to 220 in December. This
                                across-the-board increase in numbers has begun to have a noticeable
                                effect on the quality, uniformity, and coordination of military
                                operations. Also, the high quality of U.S. advisory personnel was
                                particularly noticeable. The “first team” is in the game in

                                military formations to Vietnam to provide capabilities which the
                                Vietnamese, themselves, could not quickly develop. Nearly three
                                hundred aircraft in United States military units have been deployed.
                                They include 148 transport helicopters, 11 armed helicopters, 81
                                fixed-wing transport aircraft, 13 fighter bombers, 9 light bombers,
                                4 reconnaissance fighters, and 37 liaison aircraft. Additionally, we

                            <item>More important than these strength increases is the improved state
                                of training of the Government of Vietnam armed forces. Direct United
                                States training efforts have been felt in all of the regular armed
                                forces. Additionally, United States’ operated training centers have
                                given individual training to over 90,000 members of the Civil Guard
                                and the Self Defense Corps. Training, much of it technical in
                                nature, has had to take place concurrently with the absorption of
                                large quantities of equipment, including, for example, 55 aircraft,
                                27 naval craft, 474 personnel carriers, 1,100 tactical radios, and
                                38,000 assorted infantry weapons. Additionally, the process of
                                expansion and training was conducted in a combat environment, where
                                the demands of war often took priority over training requirements.
                                In assessing the over-all strength of the Vietnamese armed forces,
                                it is the team’s opinion that current personnel strengths, modified
                                only by minor increases which have been recommended by the
                                Assistance Command, are adequate to meet the current level of Viet
                                Cong effort. Our aim for the future should be focused on improving
                                the quality of existing forces.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">The Army</hi>. Built around nine light divisions
                                and several separate battalions, the Army tended in the early months
                                of 1962 to employ conventional tactics involving large area sweeps
                                by division-size units. These operations were often inadequately
                                planned, awkwardly executed and usually unproductive. 1962 showed
                                progress in overcoming this basic weakness. Planning is now far
                                better coordinated. Commanders now consult their United States
                                advisors and give greater consideration to the influence of
                                supporting air operations. The great proportion of operations now
                                take place at the lower levels, some 26% of which were of company
                                size and 58% of platoon size during the year. By the same token,
                                progress has been made during the past year in freeing the regular
                                units to take the field to attack and pursue the Viet Cong. Army
                                units have been replaced with Self Defense Corps and Civil Guard
                                personnel in many static tasks. In the average division, six or

                                greatly in 1962. The Civil Guard increased in size from 65,000 to
                                76,000 during the year, while the Self Defense Corps grew from
                                49,000 to 80,000 men. Far more important than their growth has been

                                advisors. Over 30,000 Civil Guardsmen have undergone a three-month

                                        development of an effective intelligence system stands near
                                        the top in terms of progress achieved during 1962. Starting
                                        from an initial zero, the United States intelligence
                                        advisory program has, in a single year, grown into a
                                        reasonably effective mechanism. Its counterpart Vietnamese
                                        military intelligence program has moved decisively, although
                                        not nearly so far, in the direction of an efficient,
                                        organized system. In 1962, United States intelligence
                                        advisors have been accepted at each level of Vietnamese
                                        military command, from the Joint General Staff down to the
                                        division. In addition, United States intelligence advisors
                                        are serving at regiment and battalion level. These
                                        personnel, provided with their own communication system, are
                                        developing the capability to procure information and
                                        transmit it rapidly. In addition to providing timely
                                        information, the United States effort has the ancillary
                                        effect of energizing the Vietnamese intelligence system to a
                                        higher level of performance. In the past year, the

                                            Vietnamese forces. On the basis of this very respectable

                                            of successful operations that can be undertaken. These

                                            there is still greater willingness on the part of the
                                            people to support the government cause with information.
                                            A case in point is Plei Mrong, a Montagnard training
                                            camp in the highlands near the Cambodian border. It is

                                            of the local residents, many of whom began to volunteer

                                            and the increased size and sophistication of the Viet
                                            Cong communications system. Taking the indications in
                                            order, the first, and perhaps most disquieting, is the
                                            apparent ability of the Viet Cong to maintain their
                                            strength, or even increase it slightly, in the face of
                                            growing pressure by the government. It cannot be ignored
                                            that the Vietnamese intelligence system, having improved
                                            greatly, is doubtless uncovering Viet Cong elements
                                            which have been in the country all the time. Giving
                                            generous discount to this fact, there still is basis for
                                            concluding that the conscription base for Viet Cong rank
                                            and file is still substantial, particularly in the
                                            Delta, and that the infusion of cadres of leaders and
                                            technicians, from outside the country, continues at a
                                            significant rate.</p>
                                        <p>The same factor of improved intelligence resources
                                            applies to the growth in quantities of Communist Chinese
                                            material in the battle area. This cannot be permitted to
                                            obscure the fact that heavy Chinese infantry weapons,
                                            such as 57 millimeter recoilless rifles and associated
                                            ammunition, have recently been captured as far south as
                                            the Delta area.</p>
                                        <p>Our improved communication detection system now reveals
                                            the existence of some 224 active communist radios in
                                            South Vietnam, where a year ago only 60 had been
                                            located. While there may not be as many more radios as
                                            the improved detection facilities indicate, there is no
                                            question but that the communist systems have improved,
                                            and we know that their cryptographic arrangements have
                                            grown more sophisticated.</p>
                                        <p>These indications show that the communists are engaged in
                                            a slow, though perceptible, increase in effort. This
                                            suggests that the headquarters in Hanoi is not yet
                                            persuaded that the Americans are any different from the
                                            French; and that if they will but respond to our efforts
                                            with a determined reaction from outside the official
                                            battle areas, we will ultimately lose our confidence and
                                            our resolution.</p>

                                    <item>There are intelligence indicators which fall on the
                                        favorable side. The most significant relate to
                                        deteriorations in the physical and moral condition of the
                                        Viet Cong. Reports, in growing numbers, reflect shortages of
                                        food, and an increased repugnance of the Vietnamese people
                                        to Viet Cong depredations upon their food stocks, and
                                        extortion of their property and money. These are accounted
                                        as one of the causes for the migration of some 145,000
                                        Montagnards away from the Viet Cong into safer areas.
                                        Likewise, reports emphasize the shortage of medical
                                        supplies, and Viet Cong attacks on Vietnamese outposts are
                                        frequently launched for the express purpose of acquiring
                                        medicines. Hunger, sickness, and lack of munitions have had
                                        a visible effect in <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0107"
                                        />terms of Viet Cong defections, which have grown steadily
                                        during the year from about 75 per month in January to a peak
                                        of 215 in December. The level of Viet Cong offensive
                                        activity has diminished in a degree consistent with the
                                        foregoing impediments. From a peak of almost 1,900 incidents
                                        in March 1962, the intensity of the insurgent effort has
                                        dropped to 1,340 incidents in December 1962. In spite of
                                        this, Viet Cong personnel losses grew steadily through 1962,
                                        from an initial level of 1,900 per month to 2,750 in the
                                        month of December.</item>

                                    <item>On balance, the team concluded that the intelligence
                                        picture is much better than it was a year ago. A stronger
                                        intelligence organization; more, better and more timely
                                        information; a growth in the popular intelligence base; and
                                        a series of interlocking intelligence indicators portray an
                                        upward trend in the conduct of the war. A sobering
                                        counterpoise is the strong evidence of effective external
                                        support for the insurgency, with its consequent implications
                                        in terms of protraction of the conflict.</item>

                                not. Therefore, all programs often do not advance abreast. Here,
                                too, United States military and civilian advice has shown results
                                during the past year. In clear-and-hold operations, efforts are now
                                made to have seed and fertilizer readily at hand to permit the
                                farmers to exploit their liberated fields. Strategic hamlets are
                                encouraged to elect their own hamlet chief, thus to remove a common
                                Viet Cong propaganda target. Schools are now being run for civil
                                administrators, to help raise the standards of province, district,
                                village, and hamlet government. A village and hamlet radio system
                                has been installed for intelligence, administrative and emergency
                                warning purposes. These developments mark a small beginning in
                                weaving the military solution into the nap of the politico-economic
                                situation. The team sees this as the longest-term task of all. It is
                                a task which gives rise to the greatest apprehension, since the
                                liberated farmer is still encumbered with countless restrictions.
                                Until he is freed from these, the Viet Cong will continue to have

                                        The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> team believes that
                                        the military measures being taken in South Vietnam must
                                        continue to be considered as necessary, principally to
                                        establish conditions favorable for political and economic
                                        growth. The basic problem now is <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                                            facs="0108"/>to restore law and order, particularly in
                                        the rural areas, so that measures for the development of
                                        political and economic strength can take hold. Historically,
                                        the central government in Vietnam has not reached down and
                                        made itself felt to the peasant. Likewise, the peasant has
                                        not truly identified himself, his activities, or his future
                                        with his government, nor has he thought in terms of national
                                        political issues, as we know them. The team found that this
                                        situation is slowly beginning to change. Now the government
                                        is beginning to reach the people, and the people are
                                        beginning to reach for the government.</item>

                                    <item>The strategic hamlet program is perhaps the greatest
                                        single case for this encouraging development. It is a
                                        program aimed directly at the people that not only provides
                                        them with an elementary system of defense against, and
                                        isolation from, the Viet Cong, but also is the vehicle by
                                        which the Government of Vietnam can carry forward a
                                        political, economic, and social revolution. More than 4,000
                                        strategic hamlets have been completed and another 2,000 of
                                        the 8,000 programmed will soon be completed. In 1962, this
                                        program was instrumental in bringing an additional 500,000
                                        people under the control of the government.</item>

                                    <item>To date, elections have been held in more than a thousand
                                        hamlets. While the government attempts to insure that
                                        candidates for office are not Viet Cong members or
                                        sympathizers, the elections appear to be conducted in a
                                        democratic manner. Following the election of a hamlet chief
                                        and a hamlet council, the new officials, themselves, decide
                                        on projects for the improvement of the well-being and living
                                        conditions of the people. It is through this “rice roots”
                                        program that the framework for a democratic political
                                        process is being developed. It is the intention of the
                                        government to extend this process from the hamlets and
                                        villages up through the districts and provinces, whose
                                        officials are now appointed by the central government. The
                                        United States advisory effort, both military and civilian,
                                        is being extended to the province level to assist in the
                                        development of civic action and economic development
                                        programs. Although this is a slow process, the team believes

                                        inspectors and school principals. During 1963, nearly 8,000
                                        new teachers will be trained, and classrooms, textbooks, and
                                        supplies for 150,000 primary school students will be
                                        provided. This will add to the nearly threefold growth in

                                Explosion.” The National Campaign Plan is a concept of coordinated
                                political, economic, and military operations to be undertaken at an

                                            strategies stated as involved in that plan are in
                                            essence an incorporation of the original Thompson

                                            which splintered off from Thompson of establishing

                                            restatement of original strategy. The discussion of this
                                            complete strategy in the Three Year Plan, also under the
                                            heading of the National Campaign Plan, says the same
                                            thing in more general terms, but confuses the situation
                                            by listing the Strategic Hamlet program as a separate

                                            Campaign Plan brings the Strategic Hamlet program back
                                            into the orderly and sound concept of Province
                                            Rehabilitation. This is the appropriate strategy and the

                                result in an ever-increasing measure of control by the Government of
                                Vietnam over its people and its territory. Since the basic concept
                                is one of many small operations, with decentralized control,
                                activity has been increasing in those areas where trained units have
                                been available and where the initiative of local commanders has been
                                most pronounced. The tempo of small scale operations has now reached
                                450 per month. This tempo should increase substantially in the
                                months ahead, as the strength of South Vietnam, developed over the
                                past year, makes itself felt. However, the successful completion of
                                the strategies listed will take considerable time and will demand
                                much in resolution and perseverance. There appears to be no quick or

                                correlation of the United States military effort stems from the
                                separate organization and operation of the Military Assistance
                                Advisory Group, which uses many of the same military personnel in
                                the field as are used in combat planning and operations monitored by
                                the Military Assistance Command Vietnam staff. The team considers
                                that improvement may be realized by more closely interrelating the

                                Command Vietnam staff functions. This could be achieved without
                                prejudice to the planned phase-out of Military Assistance Command
                                Vietnam and the planned retention of the Military Assistance

                            <item>It may be both possible and desirable, within available resources,
                                to establish Army and Navy components of Military Assistance Command
                                Vietnam, deriving benefit from the clear channels of command such an
                                organization would afford. The Commander, 2d United States Air
                                Division, functions as the air component commander of Military
                                Assistance Command Vietnam. As such, the Air Force is the only
                                Service with an organization and commander under Military Assistance
                                Command Vietnam that actually functions as a component command. In
                                this context, Military Assistance Command Vietnam would become in
                                actuality a subordinate unified command of Commander in Chief
                                Pacific rather than a specially tailored organization with a number
                                of subordinate service activities reporting directly to the
                                headquarters. In any event, composition of the Military Assistance
                                Command Vietnam staff should be reviewed in the light of increasing
                                air and naval activity and in recognition of the growing importance

                                not imply centralized control of all aviation assets in South

                                exist in South Vietnam. The principal armament of this unit consists
                                of two fixed, forward-firing, machine guns and two 2.75 rocket pods.

                                additional restrictions upon rules of engagement for the armed
                                helicopters. They require that the aircraft must be fired upon
                                before they may engage a target, even when an enemy target is
                                clearly identified.</item>

                            <item>Under these rules, helicopter pilots are placed in the position of
                                being unable to attack clearly identified Viet Cong targets of
                                opportunity, in a combat situation, unless first fired upon. To some
                                degree, this places United States lives and equipment at risk
                                unnecessarily and gives the enemy an advantageous option. The United
                                States Air Force “Farmgate” units in South Vietnam are not faced
                                with these specific restrictions. They can attack identified Viet
                                Cong targets provided that: a Vietnam Air Force observer is aboard;
                                the Vietnam Air Force does not have the capability to engage the
                                target, the aircraft carry Vietnam Air Force markings and the
                                targets are designated by the Vietnamese.</item>

                                effort both in the United States and in Vietnam. Press
                                representatives charge the Government of Vietnam with repressing the
                                freedom of the press (two American newsmen were expelled from
                                Vietnam), being unduly secretive, issuing deliberately erroneous
                                news bulletins, and attempting to use the press as involuntary
                                propaganda tools. The press attitude is summed up this way: “The
                                Western press refuses to submit to such treatment.”</item>

                                instance of the harm being done to the war effort. Press members
                                admit that they were appalled at the flood of editorial punditry and
                                cries of doom elicited by the first incomplete accounts of the
                                clash. They insist defensively, and contrary to the facts, that the
                                battle was a defeat and that the stories were derived from United
                                States sources. The latter is true, but only to the extent that the
                                stories were based on ill-considered statements made at a time of
                                high excitement and frustration by a few American officers.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless, great harm has been done. Public and Congressional
                                opinion in the United States has been influenced toward thinking
                                that the war effort in Vietnam is misguided, lacking in drive, and
                                flouts the counsel of United States advisors. Doubts have been
                                raised as to the courage, the training, the determination and
                                dedication of the Vietnamese armed forces. In Vietnam the backlash
                                of these reports, both in governmental and military circles, is
                                apparent. The Vietnamese <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0116"

                                substantial, at least in terms of quality. Entrance is gained
                                through four general routes. Cadre personnel (estimated as an
                                average of 500 per month for the past few months) enter from North
                                Vietnam or Laos near the 17th parallel, and move southward in stages
                                through the Annamite Chain of mountains, utilizing a well developed
                                underground railway. Alternatively, some personnel, as well as
                                equipment, move down the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                    Minh</persName> trail through Laos, some entering South Vietnam
                                at the waist of the country, and some moving farther south to enter
                                via Cambodia. Some supplies enter by sea, either across the Gulf of
                                Siam from Cambodia, or by coastwise junk from North Vietnam. In
                                terms of magnitude it is noted that some 3000 junks were inspected
                                by the Vietnamese Navy during the past year, of which number 160
                                were proved to harbor Viet Cong. Finally, it is accepted by the
                                Advisory Command that there is a movement across the border of
                                selected commercial items, in undetermined quantity, purchased on

                                lot of the Viet Cong would be much harder. But to cauterize the 900
                                miles of border and 1500 miles of coastline presents a problem which
                                even the most dynamic of efforts on the part of the Vietnamese will

                            <item><p>a. The situation in South Vietnam has been reoriented, in the
                                    space of a year and a half, from a circumstance of near
                                    desperation to a condition where victory is now a hopeful
                                    prospect. There are numerous options of support and involvement
                                    available to the United States. They range from complete
                                    disengagement to overt commitment of United States forces with a
                                    concomitant demand on our part for full command authority over
                                    the Vietnamese. The first extreme is unacceptable. It sacrifices
                                    all that has been gained, and is tantamount to relinquishment of
                                    our position in Asia. The second is impracticable in terms of
                                    what the Vietnamese would accept, and it is undesirable from our
                                    viewpoint in that it would tend to make us responsible for every
                                    misadventure in the conflict. Intermediate to these extremes is
                                    the course of augmenting, greatly, our aid and advice to the
                                    Vietnamese; a program which could only be justified if there
                                    were major benefits clearly promised. This is not the case;
                                    there are no areas of assistance which are deficient in a
                                    quantum degree. This leads to the conclusion that the current
                                    support program in Vietnam is adequate, and should be retained
                                    with only minor alterations as may be recommended by the
                                    Advisory Command. This view derives from the conviction that we
                                    are winning slowly in the present thrust, and that there is no
                                    compelling reason to change.</p>
                                <p>b. At the same time, it is not realistic to ignore the fact that
                                    we have not given <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                        Minh</persName> any evidence that we are prepared to call
                                    him to account for helping to keep the insurgency in South
                                    Vietnam alive, and that we should do something to make the North
                                    Vietnamese bleed. Here again, the opportunities cover the full

                                the preparations of 1962 have led to the development of the human
                                and material infrastructure necessary for the successful prosecution
                                of the war within South Vietnam. The team believes that unless the

                                ingredients for eventual success have been assembled in South
                                Vietnam. Now, perseverance in the field, and at home, will be
                                required in great measure to achieve that success.</item>

                                State, Central Files, 951K.6211/1-2163)</note> Quality of reporting
                            by US newsmen here is probably as good as average reporting of stateside
                            story like earthquake or Hollywood divorce. Difference between Vietnam
                            and that kind of story is not only that accurate information more
                            difficult to come by (and accuracy far more important), but also that
                            balanced judgment on extraordinarily complex and mixed situation in this
                            country is inherently difficult to reach. Latter is in fact perhaps too
                            much to hope for from young reporters with limited facilities for
                            coverage and research.</p>
                        <p>We do not think, either, that newsmen here now are deliberately trying to
                            undermine US effort (though their work can certainly have that
                            result).</p>
                        <p>There was no malice for example in early Agency report that Captain Good
                            was killed at Ap Bac while trying futilely to get Vietnamese to fight.
                            Newsmen got this version from American advisors who believed it true
                            themselves at time and were understandably <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99"
                                facs="0125"/>bitter. Impact on US public opinion apparently was
                            incendiary, with damage irrevocably done when correct version was
                            available next day. Withholding an angle like this to major highly
                            competitive story to take time for difficult double-checking requires
                            very high degree reportorial restraint and judgment-which it not
                            realistic to expect from average Agency reporter-rests in fact that
                            major US news organizations like <gloss target="#t_UPI1"
                                >UPI</gloss>,<gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and NY Times use men
                            (average age 27) with approximately same experience to cover Vietnam as
                            they do routine stateside police beat. These three, furthermore, are
                            only US organizations that consider story important enough to station
                            full-time staff correspondent in Saigon. Other outfits use part-time
                            stringers and sporadic visits by staffers stationed elsewhere, usually
                            Hong Kong or Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>Explanation contains implicit comment on state of American press as
                            institution and perhaps goes even deeper. Older, more experienced
                            correspondents are not stationed here because editors apparently cannot
                            persuade such men to live in Saigon, and in fact often have difficulty
                            finding anyone at all who will agree to come, for essentially same
                            reasons that US agencies in Saigon have chronic recruiting problems.
                            Legendary American dream of frontier, seeing world, adventures in far
                            off lands seems no longer to have pull it once did among
                            newspapermen.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps equally significant, there are only three staff correspondents
                            stationed Saigon because this has never been consistently what editors
                            (and/or readers) rate as big story. Despite dramatic increase in
                            American involvement, visiting editors and reporters repeatedly advise
                            us that stateside public simply hasn’t been stirred by Vietnam, perhaps
                            because remoteness, perhaps obscured by more pressing understandable
                            crises like Cuba, perhaps, as they claim, by routine optimistic
                            statements from American visitors here. This has meant that so called
                            “positive” stories got relatively little play, if they make papers at
                            all, while bad news often hits page one. Same time correspondents
                            deliberately searched for “angles” to dress up story and one of best of
                            these inevitably was peculiarities of Ngo Dinh family.</p>
                        <p>On top of all this, reporting from Saigon has been immeasurably
                            complicated—as Mission has reported frequently in past—by built-in
                            incompatibility in personalities of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and American newsmen. Like most new, inexperienced regimes in
                            less-developed countries, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has poor
                            press facilities, often tries to conceal shortcomings by deceit, tends
                            to confuse US press with US Government, and pridefully resents hostile
                            criticism. Same time, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> also has
                            rather recklessly adopted policy of harassment of foreign press and
                            reprisals against specific newsmen whom it considered insulting and/or
                            unacceptably hostile to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cause.</p>
                        <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>This is not unparalleled in other new countries. Older, more experienced
                            correspondents who come here usually accept harassments with all other
                            characteristics of this war and are able to take the larger view of
                            what’s at stake here and logic of US policy under circumstances. Younger
                            men, experiencing situation like this for first time and often finding
                            news sources among equally young American advisors-tend to be shocked,
                            angry, indignant because they think US is being “suckered”, though most
                            of them also accept basic US policy intellectually when considered in
                            calmer moments.</p>
                        <p>Such young reporters, and young advisors, have yet to learn that the mark
                            of a great nation is tolerance and understanding of such tortured people
                            as Vietnamese and their petty, often rather pathetic, maneuvers to save
                            face. And they forget that the face of the government has vital bearing
                            on support of its people in conduct of war.<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">A

                        <p>This is further complicated by reality that these particular American

                            Ap Bac was reported as major <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> failure
                            at cost of American lives, and it appears from here that American
                            editorial writers, commentators, columnists licked chops with delight
                            and reached for simplest adjectives they could muster.</p>
                        <p>About <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> comment war going better
                            than reported to US public, this is collective judgment of US Country
                            Team, and of most senior American and foreign officials here. But this
                            judgment is still not unanimous among informed observers in Saigon.
                            There is still debate about outcome this struggle, newsmen report this,
                            always at risk of over-emphasizing minority viewpoint. Mission has been
                            reporting for some time that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            performance, decisively proving its capacity to win, will be ultimate
                            and in fact only solution to foreign press problem. To date performance
                            is not yet that convincing, at least to man who must give his major

                                Embassy reported that recent press accounts emphasizing U.S. combat
                                air activities in Vietnam grew out of the practice of allowing
                                journalists to accompany interdiction missions. Ambassador <persName

                                and more chance that reporters will feature Farmgate role.”

                            success. Except for relatively mild attacks in Saigon press, there have
                            been no new harassments in wake of Ap Bac, and <persName

                            move, however, it might be useful to consider sending planeload of
                            relatively senior newsmen to Vietnam for tour of country which Mission
                            would be happy to arrange. Generally our feeling is that Ap Bac
                            explosion was as much fault of US editors and pundits as that of
                            reporting from Saigon. If not already being done, perhaps Department
                            would consider series of off-record briefings for <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0128"/>top editors to clarify true
                            considerations in US policy here vis-a-vis undeniable problems of
                            application. Conceivably, this could lead to sending of more seasoned
                            correspondents for full-time duty Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mission is attempting to generate more news about <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> social and economic progress. <gloss target="#t_USIS1"
                                >USIS</gloss>-Saigon plans soon to assign officer full-time to
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to act in effect as press
                            attache to encourage such stories in foreign press (where possible with
                            minimum emphasis on American role), and to generate news on such
                            subjects for dissemination through <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>While this should help shift press attention toward real progress being
                            made socially and economically, it must be recognized that this sort of
                            thing is secondary news compared to death of single American serviceman
                            from enemy action. Unhappily it must also be noted that if correspondent
                            is set on spotting <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> shortcomings, he
                            can find them just as easily in civil activities as military operations.
                            To repeat, there are occasional one-shot opportunities to counter
                            unfavorable reporting (e.g., making available captured <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> document showing internal difficulties),
                            but in general there can be no lasting solution until it is clear to
                            even relatively casual observer that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            is winning.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> prefixed [<hi

                            believes real progress has been made in the struggle against the Viet
                            Cong since the occasion of his last visit during the summer of 1962.
                            There has been a continuous improvement in intelligence activities and
                            apparent modest gains in the economic area. Vietnamese military
                            operations are moving in the right direction, although more urging is
                            required by U.S. advisors to maintain this momentum.</p>
                        <p>On the negative side, General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1"
                                >Krulak</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> and the Assistance Command could be drawn closer
                            together. Coordination of air operations should be improved. Reaction
                            time for air support must be reduced, greater rapport must be
                            established with the Vietnamese in order to obtain advance information
                            on planned operations. Rules of engagement should be modified to permit
                            U.S. armed helicopters to fire upon the Viet Cong without having to wait
                            to be fired upon.</p>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0130"/>
                        <p>Relative to these rules, the Attorney General suggested that an early
                            decision should be sought as to whether or not this would be desirable.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> will follow
                            through on this. General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>
                            continued by stating that Vietnamese morale is good, and suggested that
                            Viet Cong morale is deteriorating. The latter judgment was based on
                            increased defections, the difficulty in retaining personnel, and their
                            demonstrated need to capture supplies, especially medicines.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> emphasized the
                            need to relieve our logistical system from supporting any effort not
                            essential to the struggle. As an example, he pointed out that in the
                            field of research and development a number of test projects are being
                            carried out which could be conducted elsewhere. <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> will take action to resolve this problem. Infiltration
                            of personnel and equipment by the Viet Cong continues both by land and
                            sea. Captured Chinese weapons are tangible evidence of the infiltration
                            of supplies from outside South Viet-Nam. The members agreed with an
                            observation by the Chairman that it is especially important to develop
                            some hard evidence of this infiltration of personnel and supplies in
                            order that it may be presented to Moscow with another version for
                            release to the press. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JW1">William

                            for South Viet-Nam for the express purpose of developing such a

                        <p>The members expressed their desire that in the transfer of responsibility
                            for certain Montagnard training programs to <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss> we do not lose the long-term assets [<hi rend="italic"

                            expressed concern at the prospect of Special Forces personnel handling
                            these projects with only a six-months tour in South Viet-Nam. The
                            members agree that while it might not be necessary for personnel
                            conducting normal instruction to stay longer than this period, certain
                            key personnel should be assigned for longer periods.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> explained the current
                            funding problem for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is how to handle
                            the Montagnard training program, as well as other paramilitary programs
                            within normal military accounting procedures. However, arrangements are
                            currently being worked out [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] within Defense to resolve this problem. It was
                            noted that it might be necessary to revise <gloss target="#t_NSAM1"

                            which is the basis for this transfer of responsibility to <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> explained that the
                            difficulty of presenting a clear organizational chart for the diverse
                            paramilitary groups in South Viet-Nam resulted from the fact that these
                            groups were developed wherever a <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0131"
                            />potential existed rather than based on a preconceived plan. However,
                            understanding of missions and coordination of operations does exist at
                            the district and provincial level.</p>
                        <p>The members expressed concern over the prospect of the creation. Of
                            approximately a 50,000 man police program for South Viet-Nam prior to

                            <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Roger</persName> and I did suggest that
                            consideration be given to expanding the contacts between U.S. personnel
                            in Saigon and noncommunist elements of the Vietnamese opposition.</p>
                        <p>There are, I think, two major reasons for doing this. First, it would be
                            part of a carefully designed program to establish a somewhat more
                            independent U.S. position in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Second, it should eventually increase our alternatives in the event of
                            an accident which results in a shift in the government.</p>
                        <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0132"/>
                        <p>I agree with <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Fritz Nolting</persName> that
                            there are dangers in raising old suspicions in the mind of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his family about
                            U.S. intentions. But I think that the risks in remaining too closely
                            tied to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s government will
                            increase rather than decrease as time goes on.</p>
                        <p>If the field agrees with the suggestion, I should imagine they would want
                            to move with great caution, and I would agree. If I were Fritz, I would
                            simply encourage our people in Saigon to be available to
                            non-governmental personalities and to listen to their problems. I would
                            avoid at the outset any involvement in officially disapproved
                            activities, but I would not discourage reporting. [<hi rend="italic">1
                                sentence (1-1/2 lines) not declassified</hi>] I have in mind one
                            such area which could be reexamined and that is the trade union
                            movement. As I understand it, the government is starting to take
                            repressive measures against Mr. <persName>Brui</persName>’s [<hi
                                rend="italic">Buu</hi>’s]union which is the only legitimate labor
                            organization in the country. I would think we might attempt to counter
                            some of these measures by discreet support of this labor organization,
                            if we believe it is soundly based.</p>
                        <p>At some point, of course, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            will become aware of shift in our present policy of total public and
                            private support of his person and family. We should face this likelihood
                            squarely and without guilt feelings. It may be necessary to re-state to
                            him as smoothly but as firmly as possible, that the interests of the
                            United States require that we maintain a friendly attitude towards all
                            his people, that we must inform ourselves of all opinion in Vietnamese
                            society, and that, occasionally, we must speak out as frankly as he does
                            on matters on which we have honest differences of opinion.</p>
                        <p>All this is rather vague and I am quite aware that neither casual
                            visitors to Saigon nor the Department itself can give specific advice on
                            such a matter to our people in the field. The most we can do is to raise

                        <p>I have read Mr. <persName>Williams</persName>’s memorandum to you of
                            February 4th on the police problem of South Vietnam.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d34fn2">The <persName>Williams</persName> cited here is
                                apparently Ogden Williams. The memorandum has not been found.</note>
                            I think he raises a legitimate point when he emphasizes the care that
                            must be taken to avoid the adverse political consequences of our support
                            of a repressive police force.</p>
                        <p>I still believe, however, that the overall problem of efficient use of
                            U.S. supported paramilitary organizations in South Vietnam should be
                            reviewed. My understanding of the historical background is that in the
                            early part of last year we were so desperate to get arms into the hands
                            of anyone who would fight the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, that
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> were inclined
                            to provide arms and training to almost any organization in South Vietnam
                            which asked for them. This was a perfectly understandable policy at the
                            time; but the numbers of men and organizations are now reaching a very
                            large total, and I am not convinced that we have a clear idea of the
                            political and military function they will serve.</p>
                        <p>The police problem is really subsidiary to this manpower problem. R.G.K.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> makes a convincing
                            argument that some form of civilian organization is required to relieve
                            the army of normal security functions after an area has been pacified.
                            His major point is that there are no professionally trained people to
                            man mobile check points and other installations to ensure control of the
                            movement of people and property. It is going to take some time to find
                            and train such people, which is why I feel that we should get started
                            before the need becomes country-wide.</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0134"/>
                        <p>From a political point of view, I feel that it is equally important to
                            get population control functions out of the hands of the army and into
                            the hands of carefully trained civilian police types as rapidly as
                            possible. <persName>Williams</persName>’s point is well taken, but this
                            is precisely the reason why our public safety people, who are
                            particularly sensitive about the political problems of the police
                            activities, should be brought in at this early stage.</p>
                        <p>Only the field, of course, can make sensible judgements about these
                            matters; I would think that a carefully drafted suggestion to them to do
                            some thinking, perhaps in consultation with <persName

                                would expect Communists couple this with political offensive for

                                becomes unbearable, we believe Communists would probably choose to

                                open intervention. Having gone underground, they might work through
                                front groups to attempt to effect change in government and would
                                probably pull cadres back across border into Laos or <gloss

                            political and military efficiency of insurgency and providing trained
                            manpower to cadre new units. We believe Communists banking on this type
                            operation to sustain insurgency at current pace or even somewhat higher
                            tempo. We do not know what maximum rate of infiltration (chiefly through
                            Laos, Cambodia and <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>) Communists could
                            maintain, but note that rate as high as that registered in June did not
                            necessitate fundamental change in nature of infiltration operation.
                            Since that time, however, regroupment of Montagnard population and
                            development of capability of Montagnards to defend themselves and harass
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have certainly increased
                            difficulties <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> hard core forces to
                            maintain themselves. Added to this are problems imposed by increasing
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forays into <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base areas.</p>
                        <p>We believe, nevertheless, that they could introduce units up to battalion
                            size and concentrate several if necessary to support critical
                            operations. (Statements of two recent defectors indicate infiltration of
                            battalion-sized group in July and another in August.) We assume <gloss
                                target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> units in southern Laos are there to
                            support operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and could be
                            introduced any time situation dictated. However, unless Communist
                            strategy changed, they would attempt to keep this intervention on a
                            relatively small and clandestine basis.</p>
                        <p>In sum, as long as infiltration operation [<hi rend="italic"
                                >garble—is</hi>?] conducted in a clandestine manner, it could vary
                            in intensity from a few hundred crossings a month for purpose of
                            supplying the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with critically needed
                            equipment and human skills up through introduction of modest number of
                            organized units not exceeding battalion strength. If the Communists
                            decided to up the scale of infiltration to organized units of regimental
                            or division strength, logistic problems involved would probably exceed
                            capabilities of present system and support effort required would destroy
                            clandestine nature of operation.</p>

                        <p>Forestalling increased infiltration through diplomatic and political
                            actions will be difficult because: (1) such an increase will likely
                            remain short of overt intervention; (2) US is hampered by lack of direct
                            leverage on countries from which infiltration comes, i.e., <gloss

                        <p>We have also continued larger scale actions directed toward hitting
                            Communists where it hurts such as aerial interdiction of Laos supply
                            routes, strikes against selected <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss>
                            targets, introduction of US combat units into <gloss target="#t_SVN1"

                            of overt intervention. We do believe, however, that their efficacy and
                            feasibility as a response to large-scale infiltration should be
                            investigated.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that our
                            civilian staff is not restrained in where it travels.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> considers the
                            strategic hamlet program good. He spoke well of <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRC1">Rufus Phillips</persName>. He indicated that the
                            program was being expanded to take care of additional requirements. He
                            said that none of the radios in strategic hamlets had been lost.
                            Reinforcements are readily available when called for. They were on the
                            alert at the airfields at each of the four Corps areas.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> described the
                            U.S. press situation as “terrible.” He pointed out that there was a good
                            article by Beech in the morning Washington Post. He suggested that there
                            should be a special press tour from U.S. run by Defense. When I
                            questioned him about this, he accepted my suggestion that perhaps it
                            would be better to try to get the press to send especially experienced
                            men out, individually.</p>
                        <p>It has been arranged that each of the four Corps should have a U.S. press
                            officer to handle the American press when they came there, and also to
                            see that information got out.</p>
                        <p>Briefings by U.S. military were being conducted to “cut the press in” on
                            information available to U.S., at least to some degree. He reported
                            excellent relations between <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName>. He spoke highly of each.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that he might wish to develop in more detail his proposal
                            made in the conference with the President, that the South Vietnamese
                            army develop commando capabilities against North Viet-Nam.<note n="2"

                                and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> also discussed
                                “the command problem”: “I urged General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Max</hi>: I had a good talk this morning with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> about his
                                trip,<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d36">Document
                                    36</ref>.</note> and touched on the question of whether General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> should report direct
                            to the Joint Chiefs, rather than <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss>. This was raised by the President and the Secretary
                            of State in our meeting last week.</p>
                        <p>To cite detailed complaints would obscure the main issue which is that if
                            we are to win in Viet-Nam, our people there must have the fullest
                            possible authority with clear lines of responsibility. This is a war of
                            constant, small incidents and innumerable daily problems of every kind.
                            We must leave these decisions to those in the field and permit them to
                            act as quickly as necessary.</p>
                        <p>What bothers us is that the basic command concept, namely, that there be
                            the closest cooperation and coordination between our military and
                            civilian activities, is not being carried out fully. It does exist in
                            Viet-Nam and in Washington. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>,
                            however, is off on the side without contact on the political and
                            economic aspects. This is the basic weakness. We are satisfied that it
                            both slows up decisions and leads to military decisions that have not
                            been concerted with the political and economic considerations.</p>
                        <p>We feel strongly that there would be a substantial benefit if General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> as <gloss
                                target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would report directly to the Chiefs

                            direct and effective channels.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">In a letter of

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: My Government has carefully
                            considered the request for four T-33 jet aircraft contained in your
                            letter to me of December, 10, 1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">Not
                                found.</note> We appreciate your Government’s desire to be come
                            better equipped to counter any threat to South Viet-Nam posed by
                            unauthorized incursions into Vietnamese air space. We understand,
                            however, that there has been no actual confirmation of such incursions
                            and that there is insufficient evidence to concluded that a threat of
                            this kind exists at the present time.</p>
                        <p>My Government’s position in this matter rests essentially on the
                            following considerations. The delivery of jet aircraft to your
                            Government could open our two Governments to charges of violating the
                            specific prohibition against jet engines contained in Article 17 of the
                            Geneva Accords. It could also lead to the acquisition of jet aircraft by
                            the North Vietnamese regime, thereby enhancing the threat which that
                            regime poses to South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>As you know, for some time our Military Assistance Program for Viet-Nam
                            has included four RT-33 jet aircraft. However, because of the
                            considerations referred to above, the delivery of these aircraft has not
                            been authorized. In our view, these considerations continue to outweigh
                            the advantages which a jet reconnaissance aircraft capability would have
                            for our joint efforts to restore internal security in South Viet-Nam.
                            Additionally, the requirement for a jet aircraft reconnaissance
                            capability, as you are aware, is at present being met by other
                            means.</p>
                        <p>I wish to assure you that we have this matter under continuous study.
                            Should any new information be brought to our attention which would
                            materially change our assessment of the situation, we would be prepared
                            to review our present position.</p>
                        <p>Accept, Mr. Secretary, the renewed assurances of my highest
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: This is a report on
                            progress as I see it in our common drive to put down the Communist
                            Insurgency in the Republic of Vietnam. I feel that this report is
                            particularly timely as we implement the National Campaign Plan.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that we have taken the military, psychological, economic
                            and political initiative from the enemy. We have kept steadily mounting
                            pressure on him in all phases of the war to return the loyalty and
                            control of the people to the Government of Vietnam. The next four to
                            eight weeks will tell us all whether or not my conviction is true.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Communists’ capabilities confronting the Government and
                            people of the Republic of South Vietnam remain very formidable indeed.
                            Capturing the initiative and winning a decisive victory are two very
                            different objectives. Victory is not attainable, if we do not exploit
                            our hard-won initiative. Victory can be delayed indefinitely or never
                            won if we do not act decisively, while applying ever increasing pressure
                            on the enemy in all areas of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are still everywhere. They still
                            have much of their relatively secure strategic base structure. If the
                            pressure which we have gradually developed everywhere is allowed to
                            level off or decrease, we will lose the initiative. We have the means to
                            increase this pressure on all fronts beginning now.</p>
                        <p>I believe we seized the initiative in September or October, though we may
                            not have realized it at that time. Analysis of progress, militarily,
                            politically, economically and psychologically leaves no doubt in my
                            mind. Here are some indicators as we see them—results achieved by not
                            only the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, but all elements of
                            your government. Results achieved since October 1962 are compared with
                            those during the prior 18 months for which records are available to
                            me.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0145"/>
                        <p>Prior to October there were 3,089 Strategic Hamlets, protecting 4,096,391
                            people in varying degrees. On 14 February 1963 6,988,826 people were
                            living in 5049 Strategic Hamlets. If we count the citizens of Vietnam
                            living in the metropolitan areas of Saigon, Dalat, Qui Nhon, Quang Ngai,
                            Danang and Hue, who are not in strategic wards, an additional 823,827
                            people are living and working in secure conditions. The number of people
                            enjoying the security of Strategic Hamlets will steadily increase as
                            each day passes.</p>
                        <p>Prior to October, there were many different ideas in the <gloss
                                target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and the Provinces on how the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat should be defeated. Through your
                            leadership, these differences in methods and strategy have been
                            dramatically reduced. Our advisors report for the first six weeks of
                            1963 that 80% of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> effort has
                            been applied to Clear and Hold operations, directly supporting and
                            protecting the Province Rehabilitation and Strategic Hamlet
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Militarily, the average number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            initiated incidents per week prior to October 1962 was 347. Since
                            October it has been 271 with the trend continuing downward.</p>
                        <p>Prior to October, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> initiated 98
                            armed attacks per week, now the average is 80, again the trend downward.
                            Part of the explanation is that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            has had to increase the size of attacking forces if they hope to be
                            successful. This is good because the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            cannot now be in as many places simultaneously. Militarily, this is good
                            because the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is exposed to more
                            decisive defeats by the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Another reliable military index is weapons captured. Prior to October the
                            monthly averages were 474 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> weapons
                            lost and 304 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> weapons captured. Since
                            October the ratio is increasingly in favor of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, 401 <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> weapons lost each month to 506 <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> weapons captured.</p>
                        <p>Rapidly improving communications permit reporting of many smaller scale
                            incidents and engagements which never have come to the attention of
                            Saigon authorities before. I believe the figures we now have are the
                            most reliable possible.</p>
                        <p>Several primary reasons have made these gains possible. There is ever
                            increasingly effective intelligence on the enemy, military and
                            political. The population is seeing physical evidence of its
                            government’s interest and ability to protect and assist them. The <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> more and more must rely on force and
                            brutality to supply themselves and recruit personnel at the cost of both
                            the political and psychological support of increasing numbers of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>These vital improvements in the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
                            position could not have occurred without a steadily improving military
                            situation. The 9th Division has been trained and equipped; their record
                            in full field operations is one of which we all should be proud. The
                            25th Division will complete its training and be fully equipped for field
                            operations in April. The M-113 units are equipped, trained and
                            operating. The state of training and equipment of the other elements of
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, combined with steadily
                            improving leadership, have made our gains possible.</p>
                        <p>There remain several important elements of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1"
                                >RVNAF</gloss> which are not being used to full advantage. Some of
                            the artillery is not being effectively used. I have directed a study
                            which will develop solid recommendations for improvement. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> reorganization has not <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0146"/>proceeded the way we would hope,
                            especially the organization and functions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> headquarters, as they pertain to
                            logistical operational functions. Control of these functions has been
                            retained at <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> level, whereas in
                            original joint planning it was agreed that they could best be
                            accomplished by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> headquarters by
                            delegation of authority and appropriate transfer of personnel. Division
                                <gloss target="#t_TOC1">TOC</gloss>’s are not yet capable of giving
                            Division Commanders the ability to monitor and control operations that
                            they must have if they are to be effective. The <gloss target="#t_JOC1"
                                >JOC</gloss> already provides the <gloss target="#t_JGS1"
                                >JGS</gloss> with much current information. However, operational
                            control must be decentralized to the Corps and Division Commanders who
                            have the responsibility, the means and the tactical knowledge to do the
                            best job possible. As we gain more experience in the new organization of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, I am confident that these
                            conditions will be corrected.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the strategic hamlet program—the real core of our effort
                            here in the Republic of Vietnam—is proceeding at a rapid pace. The
                            military clear and hold operations, the construction of defenses and the
                            training and arming of defenders are moving along in a well-planned and
                            coordinated effort. However, I am sure that you will agree with me that
                            the military effort is just half the battle. Along with the military
                            programs there must be other governmental programs such as public
                            health, education, agricultural assistance, psychological warfare, etc.,
                            etc., etc. All these are necessary to win the hearts and minds of the
                            people, to inform them of what the government is trying to do, and to
                            assure them that the government is doing everything in its power to
                            suppress the common enemy and restore peace and freedom in the Republic
                            of Vietnam. Therefore I would suggest that all agencies of the
                            government be urged to intensify their efforts within their particular
                            fields so that the National Campaign Plan will not be solely a military
                            effort, but in fact a true national effort. I am not sure at this time
                            that all agencies are completely familiar with the details and
                            objectives of the National Campaign Plan.</p>
                        <p>What of the enemy? The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> know they have
                            an adversary who, for the first time, is capable of defeating him. They
                            have become the hunted instead of the hunter. Captured documents and
                            personnel, plus other intelligence, reveal <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> dismay and concern. However, he is a long way from
                            defeat. He may have more military capability today than he did a year
                            ago. But, he is being driven from the base of his support, the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The ever-increasing rate of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defectors,
                            including hard core people, attest to the enemy’s concern. However, the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can recapture the initiative if
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pressure on him is lessened or
                            allowed to level off. In certain areas, notably the Camau peninsula, he
                            is as strong or <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0147"/>stronger than
                            ever. In the northern provinces he has the people, organization and
                            forces to turn the tide in his favor if we should allow him to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>What of time? Time is on our side if we use the ever-increasing <gloss
                                target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> capabilities to steadily increase the
                            pressure on the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in every way,
                            militarily, politically, economically and psychologically. Time is on
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>’s side if this pressure is
                            relaxed, or we rest on our laurels.</p>
                        <p>Time and weather are either for us or against us. In the high plateau,
                            and in southern Vietnam, half of the dry season has already passed. When
                            the wet season arrives, we will no longer be able to apply all the
                            mobility and firepower we have developed. Between now and then, the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> must not be allowed to regroup or
                            rest. We must attack and destroy them. We must hurt them so badly, that
                            they will be forced to apply all their remaining resources merely to
                            survive. If we don’t, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> may
                            neutralize much of the gain we have won at great cost and effort. In the
                            meantime, we must apply ever increasing pressure on the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in the north and central coastal areas to
                            make new gains, protect and consolidate those we have won, and prepare
                            for increased operations with the coming of good weather.</p>
                        <p>Time is on our side, if we use it properly. All plans must guarantee that
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> get no relief from the steadily
                            increasing pressure of our efforts to win the population and put down
                            the Communist insurgency.</p>
                        <p>The National Campaign Plan which you have recently approved places high
                            priority on eliminating the enemy ability to infiltrate into the
                            Republic of Vietnam and to move about the country. We must succeed in
                            this task.</p>
                        <p>I conclude that the Republic of Vietnam is defeating the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. I conclude that to relent now, in
                            optimism over the favorable results and achievements of the past few
                            months could be ruinous or fatal to the <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                >RVN</gloss> counterinsurgency. Your senior military and political
                            leaders in the field sense that victory for the first time is in their
                            grasp. Your armed forces rank and file are as fine soldiers as exist in
                            the world today. They are young and ready to carry on with the fight.
                            Their leaders, tired as they are of a generation of fighting for their
                            country and very existence, have the skill and determination to lead
                            them to victory. The means and morale needed for <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                >RVN</gloss> victory over the insurgents are evident everywhere.</p>
                        <p>As for me and my advisors, I now see the way clear to achieve decisive
                            military results in the next six months which will permit the ultimate
                            complete defeat of the Communists in the Republic of Vietnam. There will
                            be bitter fighting for much longer but the military result should not be
                            in doubt. The tremendous task of transforming a colonial empire into a
                            prosperous, proud and democratic Republic, a model for all of Asia, will
                            take even longer. The means of military <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122"
                                facs="0148"/>victory are now in hand. The foundations of liberty and
                            prosperity are in process. Time is the key to our success or failure. I
                            urge that we use time to our advantage-give the enemy no rest. Attack on
                            all fronts until the Communist insurgency is put down and they are
                            driven from the country, physically and spiritually.<note n="2"

                            remarks accordingly when they talk to newsmen. Nonetheless, the
                            impression persists here that the lack of perspective which has been
                            characteristic of news reports from Viet Nam springs at least in part
                            from inadequately informed American military sources. Could you give me
                            a brief rundown on what is being done to insure that official Americans
                            in Viet-Nam understand why we are in Viet-Nam, what our role there is,
                            and how, in general, the war is going? How are they briefed? Is it
                            possible to give <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisers in the
                            field a regular news picture of how the war is going (beyond their own
                            bailiwick)? Any chance of increasing the coverage of the Armed Forces
                            radio? We have survived guerrilla war between the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the reporters, but public criticism
                            between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> brothers in arms
                            can be more serious.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that in a recent letter to the Ambassador,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d44fn2"><ref target="#d24">Document 24</ref>.</note> the
                            Governor suggested that since the Vietnamese appear unable or unwilling
                            to give the newsmen adequate, accurate, and timely information on the
                            war, we must do at least part of the job ourselves, perhaps on an
                            unattributed basis. I believe that in fact you have been doing this
                            discreetly for some time (e.g. <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                                7583),<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Dated February 16, telegram 758
                                reported that the Task Force planned expanded efforts to promote
                                news about South Vietnamese social and economic progress.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, PPV 7 <gloss target="#t_S1"
                                    >S</gloss> VIET-US)</note> but I don’t know how far you have
                            gone. Are you still avoiding giving out news which does not have some
                            connection with American personnel?</p>
                        <p>I believe the consensus here on this problem is that we should give the
                            newsmen as complete a picture as possible without regard to the source
                            of our information or the degree of US involvement. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> complains, we can simply say that we
                            have to be candid with <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0152"/>our
                            press in order to maintain our present Viet-Nam policy. I don’t think we
                            have your full views on this idea or know exactly what you are now
                            doing.</p>
                        <p>In the suggestion box we have a couple of ideas on the press problem
                            which I pass along to you for whatever they may be worth. We are
                            somewhat concerned that the plan originally called “explosion” which
                            matured into the national offensive will be picked up by the newsmen and
                            played as the last big push. To prevent this, perhaps we could make it
                            clear in discussions with newsmen that the national offensive now
                            getting under way is really only a gradual increase in activity rather
                            than a sudden or climactic acceleration of the war effort.</p>
                        <p>Also, to improve the American image of the Vietnamese fighting man—which
                            unhappily is not good at the moment because of unfavorable press reports
                            of the Ap Bac affair—I wonder if we could not find ways of bringing
                            individual acts of heroism and valor to the attention of the newsmen.
                            Probably the best way to do this is through our advisers in the field
                            who are most familiar with such stories and who see newsmen from time to
                            time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Governor</hi>: This is in response to your
                            letter of February 18<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Not found.</note>
                            outlining Mike Forrestal’s thoughts about more contacts between American
                            personnel in Viet-Nam and non-Communist members of the Vietnamese
                            opposition.</p>
                        <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>I am sorry that <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName> didn’t voice
                            these thoughts while he was here. We could then have filled him in on
                            what is done in this regard on a regular basis and with the knowledge of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In fact, I should have been
                            glad to introduce him to dozens of non-commie members of the Vietnamese
                            opposition at our home. These might have included a wide assortment of
                            Vietnamese friends—bankers, businessmen, labor leaders, landowners,
                            layers, doctors, university professors-who would doubtless have had a
                            field day criticizing the government in varying degrees and from various
                            angles. But what good this would have done—outside of demonstrating a
                            point and possibly stimulating a coup—I don’t know!</p>
                        <p>I must confess to being somewhat astonished by the implication that we
                            are living in cocoons here, dealing only with <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> officials and deliberately cutting ourselves off from
                            other Vietnamese elements. This has never been the case since I have
                            been here. One of the first things I did upon arrival was to tell
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> personally that I
                            intended to see and talk with members of the opposition; that I wanted
                            him to know this and trusted that he would not consider it as plotting
                            or as throwing doubt on US support of South Viet-Nam through its duly
                            elected government. He accepted this in good spirit and we have been
                            doing it ever since. All members of my staff know that they are free to
                            do the same. I have heard some false reports to the contrary. These I
                            attribute to the proclivity of certain oppositionists (and to certain
                            former members of our Mission) to charge a freeze-out when, after hours
                            of conversation, they fail to change one’s opinion.</p>
                        <p>There is, of course, a great difference between being accessible to
                            oppositionists and giving them encouragement. Many of them tend towards
                            radical solutions and we give them no encouragement. If we are not
                            crystal clear on this, we would stimulate revolution. We have, however,
                            frequently passed on to members of the government what seemed to be
                            reasonable suggestions from oppositionists, and some of these have
                            resulted in government actions. I think, for example, of suggestions
                            about “the complaints department”, the Council of Economic Advisors, and
                            the Provincial Advisory Councils; also such specific complaints as local
                            officials’ overcharging for identity cards in certain Saigon
                            districts.</p>
                        <p>In brief, I think we have been doing all along what <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM1">Mike</persName> suggests, if I interpret the
                            suggestion correctly. If, however, the idea is to try to build up an
                            alternative to the present government, I believe you already know that I
                            am opposed, for reasons: (1) that I see no viable or better alternative;
                            (2) that any such attempt would ruin the carefully built base of our
                            advisory and supporting role here, which must rest on persuasion and on
                            confidence in our integrity.</p>

                        <p>I should add that, after the unequivocal public pronouncements of Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> two years ago,
                            and more recently the Attorney General and other high US officials,
                            which I myself thought right and proper, I would not find it possible to
                            be the agent in a change of. US policy away from forthright support of
                            the legitimate government, which happens also, in my opinion, to be the
                            best available at the present time.</p>

                        <p>The increases recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will
                            support the planned intensified national effort, meet the time-phased
                            requirements of “clear and hold” operations, and support the strategic
                            hamlet program in South Vietnam. The main objective in increasing the
                            paramilitary strength to the proposed levels is to ensure permanent
                            control in areas secured as the national campaign progresses. The
                            proposed levels were developed by applying a formula that allows, for
                            example, two <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0158"/>squads of SDC for
                            each secure village, one platoon for each village not under government
                            control, one platoon for each group of three villages, and one platoon
                            for each training center. Requirements developed in this manner were
                            2500 platoons and 1600 squads. Civil Guard requirements were estimated
                            by province in a parallel manner. It is anticipated that the Junk Force
                            will be a continuing paramilitary operation that should be regularized
                            to a status comparable with the SDC. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"

                            be 4,600 junk sailors to man 644 junks. The actual strengths on 15 Jan
                            63 were Civil Guard—77755 and SDC—99797.</p>

                                to a theoretical zero. The plan also provides a balanced residual
                                national military strength approximating 368,000. Maintenance of the

                                Continued US assistance will be required to maintain these forces.
                                This assistance must be subject to continued assessment to reflect
                                requirements resulting from situation changes both in Vietnam and
                                Southeast Asia. By separate action the Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                                establishing procedures for semi-annual formal review of the

                                control of the insurgency attained. Conceivably, should the

                        <p>I hesitate to play the role of Cassandra again in regard to Vietnam and
                            Southeast Asia. However, I remain deeply concerned about the outlook
                            there, and having talked to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mike
                                Mansfield</persName> about his Report and the rather fragile nature
                            of our present position, I feel that I should frankly express my
                            misgivings to you.</p>
                        <p>I see nothing in the present course of events to dispel my conviction,
                            expressed to you and the Secretary on several occasions, that this
                            situation may ultimately prove to be as troublesome as Cuba in its
                            effects on the Administration’s position at home and abroad.</p>
                        <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0163"/>
                        <p>Although the general outlook here in Washington and in Saigon now seems
                            to be cautiously optimistic, it may be worthwhile to remind ourselves of
                            the confident assumptions of the Eisenhower Administration in a somewhat
                            similar situation during the winter of 1954.</p>
                        <p>Thus on February 19, 1954, Congressman Walter Judd told the New York
                            Times that Admiral Radford, in testimony to the House Foreign Affairs
                            Committee, reported “the development by the French and Vietnamese
                            commanders in Indo-China, supported by United States financial and
                            military assistance, of a broad strategic concept which within a very
                            few months should insure a favorable turn in the course of the war
                                …<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Ellipsis in the source text.</note>
                            Communist prospects of achieving any decisive immediate successes are
                            slight while their prospects for ultimate victory are non-existent.”</p>
                        <p>One month later, on March 22nd, following a White House conference with
                            President Eisenhower, General Ely, and Defense Secretary Charles Wilson,
                            Admiral Radford was again reported in the New York Times as saying that
                            he planned to take up with General Ely the question of U.S.
                            participation in training the Vietnamese army.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d52fn3">For documentation on discussions concerning Vietnam
                                with General Paul Ely, Chairman of the French Chiefs of Staff, in
                                Washington in March 1954, see Foreign Relations, 1952-1954, vol.
                                XIII, Part 2, pp. 1133-1173.</note> “The French are going to win,”
                            the Admiral was quoted as saying. “It is a fight that is going to be
                            finished with our help.”</p>
                        <p>Six weeks later, on May 8, 1954, came the surrender of the French
                            garrison at Dien Bien Phu, and the collapse of the entire French
                            position in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Nine years have passed, and now it is we who appear to be striving, in
                            defiance of powerful indigenous political and military forces, to insure
                            the survival of an unpopular Vietnamese regime with inadequate roots
                            among the people. And now, as in 1954, many able U.S. military
                            authorities are convinced that the situation is moving in our favor and
                            that victory can be foreseen within two to three years.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if these assurances are not based on a dangerously false
                            premise, i.e., that the Communists will not embarrass us by upping the
                            military ante.</p>
                        <p>What we are now holding in check is the Communist “Fourth Team,” most of
                            which, as General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>
                            pointed out in a recent interview in Saigon, is made up of local forces
                            armed with old weapons. A much more effective Third Team could be
                            produced by introducing a few thousand of General Giap’s well-armed
                            North Vietnamese troops as “volunteers,” either as cadre infiltrators or
                            as organized units. A still more formidable Second Team could emerge
                            through the addition of Chinese “volunteers” with modern equipment. <pb
                                n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0164"/>The First Team (an admittedly
                            unlikely entry since it would create an all-out war) would comprise the
                            Chinese and Vietnamese armies themselves.</p>
                        <p>Is it not a serious mistake for us to assume that the Communists will
                            limit their efforts in South Vietnam to actions that we can conveniently
                            contain through our present “advisory” operations? On the contrary, it
                            seems to me very likely that Communist counter-pressures will grow in
                            direct proportion to the effectiveness of our own efforts.</p>
                        <p>If this assumption is borne out by events, it is more than possible that
                            we may soon be faced with increasing Communist opposition, growing U.S.
                            casualties, and rising public resentment here in the United States,
                            followed, as in the days of Korea, by politically inspired demands that
                            we either “admit our error” and withdraw, or go after “the real enemy,
                            which is China.”</p>
                        <p>I am not unaware of the enormous amount of time, energy and dedication
                            that our people in Washington and Saigon are giving to the problems we
                            face in Vietnam. Nor do I profess to have a handy formula that will
                            enable us quickly to move to firmer ground in our Vietnam operations. I
                            am nonetheless convinced that the ground on which we now stand is likely
                            to become steadily more treacherous unless we attempt a new approach to
                            these problems.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendations:</hi></p>
                        <p>In the light of this situation, I believe that some basic changes in the
                            policy and personnel aspects of our South Vietnam operations are
                            required as quickly as may be feasible.</p>
                        <p>These changes should be designed (1) to strengthen our political and
                            military position in Vietnam vis-a-vis the Viet Cong; (2) to lay the
                            groundwork for an acceptable negotiated <hi rend="italic">political</hi>
                            settlement in Southeast Asia as a whole at a time when we still retain
                            some strong cards; and (3) to head off serious political pressures here
                            at home well in advance of the 1964 open political season.</p>

                                        toughness have been thoroughly tested, would be my first

                        <p>I believe that the time may be ripe, for instance, for a discreet,

                                >USSR</gloss> in which the potential dangers to both Moscow and
                            Washington that the Vietnam impasse contains may be underscored.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, there is already some evidence of an increasing concern about the

                            concern that we might profitably explore.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of my previous talks on Cuba and Communist China
                            with Ambassador <persName>Dobrynin</persName>, there may be something to
                            gain—and certainly nothing to lose—in my quietly raising the Vietnam
                            dilemma with him in an informal way.</p>
                        <p>The eight-point program which I have proposed is admittedly strong
                            medicine. But, in my opinion, our present course of action within a

                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is very likely to fail, and for
                            this failure we may eventually be called upon to pay a heavy price, both
                            in Asia and here at home.</p>
                        <p>Again forgive me the Cassandra role, but I am deeply alarmed about the
                            present situation, and I feel that more promising policy choices are
                            available to us.</p>

                                <item>Point is ambiguous. Committee does not favor establishment of

                        <p>Above replies based on situation which now exists in <gloss
                                target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. National Police organization functions
                            as the primary security force in major urban areas while military forces
                            have this role in rural areas. Military forces, as part of their mission
                            to secure rural areas, engage in movement and population control
                            measures; as areas are cleared of insurgents and the military begins to
                            relinquish control, civil law and order must be established. At this
                            time National Police should be phased into rural area control function,
                            and plans must be developed to accomplish this. It is visualized that
                            members of paramilitary units being demobilized would provide a
                            recruiting base for local police. It is also recognized that necessity
                            for movement and population controls will be greatly reduced when civil
                            law and order replace military controls. In this regard the final
                            disposition or status of the Civil Guard must be determined.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I had lunch today with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Tran van
                                Chnong</persName>. After lunch the Ambassador said he had something
                            very important and private to tell me.</p>
                        <p>He began by saying that he had great difficulty in assessing the
                            political importance of the <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> report. He said that his own estimate of
                            public opinion in the United States was that it was 99% against the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government, and that
                            sooner or later the political <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0169"
                            />effect of this report would be felt on U.S. efforts in South Vietnam.
                            The <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report, he believed,
                            was just another manifestation of this feeling, and it would no doubt be
                            followed by worse reports.</p>
                        <p>He then said that he had been in this country for eight years and. under
                            normal circumstances would have resigned as Ambassador a long time ago.
                            The reason he didn’t was that he did not see how he could return home as
                            a private citizen and live in any security. He said he did not dare even
                            to write to his brother, who is still living in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>As a Vietnamese patriot, he said he strongly disapproved of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime, which was not only a
                            dictatorship, but worse-an inefficient one. He said he realized the
                            United States had brought all sorts of pressures on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to liberalize the regime but that
                            such pressures were doomed to failure, since running a totalitarian
                            regime was like riding a tiger—you could not get off its back.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he knew Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> very well, since he was his son-in-law. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was the intellectual force behind
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and would never give up
                            his political power willingly. Indeed it was largely because of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> that the Vietnamese
                            Government was deprived of the services of its most able people. There
                            has been a deliberate policy of forcing any person of competence out of
                            his job and into exile. As a result, no matter how much American aid is
                            poured into the country, it will not be managed properly. He estimated
                            that within six months it would become obvious that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime could not possibly win the
                            war against the Viet Cong. The Ambassador fervently maintained that the
                            United States could not and should not withdraw from his country. To do
                            so, he said, would condemn all Southeast Asia to Communist control. On
                            the other hand, we could not win with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>. Therefore there was only one course open to us and
                            that was to bring about a change in government, which could probably
                            only be done with violence.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was almost entirely one-sided, and I was sufficiently
                            non-plussed that I contributed very little to it myself. I protested
                            some of the Ambassador’s statements in the early part of the
                            conversation, but this only served to make him more emotional. Although
                            it occurred to me that the Ambassador might be provoking a reaction, I
                            am inclined to think that he believed what he was saying. He asked that
                            our conversation not be reported.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">In a March

                            familiar for some time with the Ambassador’s feelings. He has evidently
                            talked this way to a number of people and to each one has asked that the

                                Saigon, November 9, 1962, the Embassy asked for press guidance in
                                connection with the South Vietnamese crop destruction operation in
                                Phuoc Lon Province. The Embassy suggested that, if questioned
                                regarding U.S. involvement, Embassy officials should reply that the
                                United States had provided chemicals and advice, at the request of
                                the South Vietnamese Government. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>,
                                751K.00/11-962) The Department of State responded, in telegram 516
                                to Saigon, November 14, that the Embassy’s suggestion was sound, but
                                any such explanation should be prefaced by remarks emphasizing that
                                this crop destruction program was inspired and operated by the South
                                Vietnamese. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> As Saigon
                            undoubtedly aware, Communist bloc propaganda on “poison gas” in Vietnam
                            apparently is to be massive effort comparable with Korean germ warfare
                            campaign. If Mission concurs, we feel situation calls for action
                            vis-à-vis free world press considerably beyond limits set by <gloss
                                target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>s. Our thinking is that news
                            dispatches with Saigon datelines telling whole story [<hi rend="italic"
                                >of</hi>] exactly what is happening would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Suggest accordingly, if Mission has not already done so, that newsmen
                            there, including all available third country correspondents, be called
                            in and told in complete detail everything about both crop destruction
                            and defoliation operations. This preferably should be done by <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but if this not feasible, Mission
                            itself should conduct briefing on non-attribution basis.</p>
                        <p>Briefing should particularly accent extreme precautions being taken to
                            spray only crops which are established beyond doubt as part of Communist
                            food supply. It should include details on provisions for compensation of
                            damage done unintentionally to innocent peasants, and copious anecdotal
                            background on such advance preparations among population as sacrificial
                            animals for Montagnards. Note that these chemicals widely used in
                            US.</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0171"/>
                        <p>Point should be clearly made that operations are being conducted
                            exclusively by Vietnamese planes and personnel with US only supplying
                            chemicals. If Mission finds it feasible, perhaps plane could be provided
                            to fly newsmen over sprayed areas.</p>
                        <p>Principle applicable here, in our opinion, is fact that extraordinary
                            precautions have indeed been taken to limit spraying to unquestionably
                            legitimate military requirements, that denial of food and ambush sites
                            is wholly normal procedure in counter-insurgency warfare, and that
                            neither US nor <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has anything to hide
                            about this. It is essential to achieve necessary credibility, especially
                            in uncommitted third countries, that every possible detail (short of
                            compromising future operations) be given to newsmen on scene. <persName

                                provide an improved forward air control and an increased air
                                reconnaissance capability. This increased capability is essential to
                                the success of the accelerated counterinsurgency operations in South
                                Vietnam as a part of the national campaign. There are now four L-28
                                aircraft in Farmgate which are available for visual surveillance and
                                tactical air control. Although programs such as the one for RT-28
                                pilot training are underway to increase the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1"

                                the additional air photo reconnaissance capability at this time must
                                be provided by the US Air Force from resources not currently

                                facilitate the sea movement of supplies from Saigon to these coastal
                                points for inland movement, predominantly by airlift. The total
                                monthly air transport requirement is estimated to be 4,375,700 ton
                                miles. Compared with the present air transport capability of
                                2,190,500 ton miles, a lift deficit of 2,185,200 ton miles is
                                indicated. There are two C-123 squadrons and one CV-2B company in
                                South Vietnam now. The proposed addition of one US Air Force C-123
                                squadron and one US Army CV-2B company would overcome the

                            <item>In addition to augmenting air resources in South Vietnam by the
                                means outlined above, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                                indicates that a 30-35 per cent increased sortie rate for Farmgate
                                would result from doubling pilot and maintenance resources, with
                                appropriate adjustment made to the flying hour program. The present
                                combined monthly sortie rate for Farmgate and the Vietnam Air Force
                                is 1,462. Compared with the estimated monthly sortie rate of 2,642
                                to support the national effort, a deficit of 1,180 sorties per month
                                will exist. Present strength of Farmgate, including the recent
                                augmentation, totals 42 aircraft and 277 personnel. Increasing the
                                Farmgate sortie rate by the assignment of additional personnel would
                                reduce the estimated sortie deficit established by the increased
                                national effort.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s recent report on
                            his visit to Southeast Asia.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d42">Documents 42</ref> and <ref target="#d43"
                                >43</ref>.</note> I assume you will pass them on to the Governor if
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>As you know, there was a considerable difference between the tone and
                            content of the initial U.S. news agency stories and of the report
                            itself. As is, unhappily, so often the case, the news stories accented
                            its negative comment on the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Reactions thus came in two parts: dismay initially, a degree of
                            reassurance when the full text of the report arrived. As far as I know,
                            neither the U.S. Mission nor the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was
                            given an advance copy of the report. If this had been done, some of the
                            damage inflicted by incomplete press dispatches could have been averted.
                            It would be useful to distribute advance copies to the parties concerned
                            in future release of papers of this sort.</p>
                        <p>There was no coverage at all of the report in the Vietnamese press, and
                            thus no editorial comment. This in itself is significant, in my opinion,
                            of a rather chastened mood (however privately bitter) inside the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as a result of such recent reminders of
                            sensitive U.S. public opinion as the press uproar over Ap Bac and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>’s public criticism
                            of the lack of adequate facilities for newsmen in Viet-Nam. In previous
                            cases of this sort, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> often has
                            printed severe foreign criticism in its controlled press, in order later
                            to counter-attack. There <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0179"/>was a

                                xml:id="d60fn3">Not found.</note> that one group inside the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wanted to use this technique on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, but was overruled
                            by the palace.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, the Mission feared that Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> would be stirred to attack the U.S. in her speech on
                            Truong Sisters Day (the national women’s festival) which happened to
                            come a few days after the <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> paper was released. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> strongly advised the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against permitting her to do this, and
                            in fact warned that he would walk out of the ceremony if she persisted,
                            thus precipitating an ugly, open issue. The speech contained some
                            unpleasant comment on foreign critics, but there were no names and in
                            general it was moderate by comparison with some of her past
                            explosions.</p>
                        <p>As of my departure from Saigon on March 5, there had been no further
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> public comment that could be
                            related to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>. This clearly
                            seemed to be a hard policy decision since <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> sources had also refrained even from private, anonymous
                            comment to foreign newsmen.</p>
                        <p>To a lesser degree, this was also true of official <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> comment to the U.S. Mission (as of
                            March 5). I happened to have applied for a meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> a fortnight earlier to
                            discuss plans for the projected Chieu Hoi (call to return) program to
                            encourage Communist defections. On the morning after the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report was released, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> called me to the palace to talk
                            Chieu Hoi. It was quickly evident that what he really wanted to discuss
                            was <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>—but he was
                            relatively guarded, again I think reflecting a <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> decision not to engage in polemics with the U.S. at
                            this point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> main point was that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report would hurt
                            the Chieu Hoi effort because it suggested flagging U.S. support and thus
                            would influence possible <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defectors to
                            postpone action (which seemed a bit incongruous in view of his repeated
                            previous statements that the U.S. presence should be downplayed). At one
                            point he called the report “treachery” and he remarked rather
                            enigmatically that “it changes everything,” declining my invitation to
                            elaborate. He listened somewhat absently and wearily as I remarked that
                            the report was not U.S. Government policy (which I think he doubted, on
                            the assumption that it could not have been released without the
                            President’s approval) and that nothing should be permitted to weaken the
                            existing close U.S. working relations with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> in Viet-Nam. Altogether <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> gave an impression of weary frustration with what he
                            considers U.S. vagaries-or worse. He definitely was not as angry as on
                            some previous occasions, but there seemed little doubt that the report
                            would add to U.S. difficulties in working with him. (<persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> commented similarly to <gloss
                                target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, including, I believe, an unhappy
                            reference to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s praise
                            for <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>, whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> detests.)</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0180"/>
                        <p>A few days later, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            called me to the palace to express regrets about my departure for
                            Washington. He talked for 2-1/2 hours, mostly about military operations,
                            and mentioned the <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report
                            only once. This was a parenthetical remark that such foreign talk as
                            this encourages the Communists to make a greater effort. He said it
                            possibly would lead to new Communist infiltration to try to exploit the
                            report’s “demoralizing” impact in South Viet-Nam. He did not pursue the
                            subject further and plainly wanted no comment from me. He was otherwise
                            friendly and apparently unperturbed.</p>
                        <p>I can’t recall that my lower-level <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            friends volunteered any reaction at all to the report. When I asked Phan
                            Van Tao, Director General of Information, what he thought, the reply was
                            a grimace and shrug, again tending to confirm my theory of a policy
                            directive to clam up. But there was no doubt that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was shaken by the initial press
                            treatment of the report, coming as it did on top of a wave of other
                            criticisms. On the basis of my personal knowledge of the notable
                            personality complexities of the <persName>Ngo Dinh</persName> family, it
                            may be speculated that this kind of suppressed bitterness could turn out
                            to be more consequential to our relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> than a public explosion.</p>
                        <p>The full text of the <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                            report had just arrived when I left Saigon. The immediate result was
                            relaxation, as it was seen that <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> urged continuation of the U.S. effort at its
                            present level. The longer term impact remains to be seen, but it may be
                            useful to register some personal speculation.</p>
                        <p>It is close to axiomatic that the <persName>Ngo Dinhs</persName> are
                            seldom “persuaded” in the Western sense, by logical U.S. arguments.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, for example, has said
                            repeatedly that Americans don’t “understand” Asians, Communism, or much
                            of anything else on the intellectual level. Where the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has acceded to U.S. wishes, as it
                            frequently does, and often gracefully, I think the main reason has been
                            a realistic acceptance of the political imperative to get along with the
                            U.S., not because our arguments were compelling-however much the results
                            may have subsequently confirmed them. This, I think, is why very few of
                            our agreements with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had
                            materialized except when the U.S. brought direct, specific pressure. It
                            is characteristic of the <persName>Ngo Dinhs</persName> [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that they
                            usually come to claim as their own successful actions that were
                            initially urged by foreign advisers, e.g. the strategic hamlet program
                            which grew in large measure from the <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1"
                                >Thompson</persName> Mission.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I don’t think the <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>
                            paper will have much effect, in itself, on <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> performance, i.e., its suggestions for specific actions
                            will not be persuasive. On the contrary, I think <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the Nhus will resent the
                            outrageous claim of a foreigner to the right to discuss <pb n="155"
                                xml:id="pg_155" facs="0181"/>internal Vietnamese affairs, and this
                            in turn will exacerbate their existing emotional attitudes toward the
                            U.S. These, however, were already richly developed.</p>
                        <p>But politically I think it may turn out that <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName>’s report will be beneficial to the U.S.
                            interest at the Saigon operating level. We have lately been approaching
                            a showdown in our dealings with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            in some areas, e.g., the recent prolonged dispute about a <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> piaster appropriation for the strategic
                            hamlets. Within limits, the Mission has almost literally been doing what
                            our press critics have so long urged: “getting tough with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.” This, I think, has combined
                            with the recent stateside public splashes on Viet-Nam to create the
                            psychological state of suppressed bitterness mentioned above. In effect,
                            what’s happening is that the <persName>Ngo Dinhs</persName>’ (especially
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName>) dislike and suspicions
                            of the U.S. are hardening, and presumably will make trouble for us at
                            some future date as the Communist threat declines. But at the same time
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> seems to have decided
                            realistically, on the political level, to go along with us at the
                            pressure points, as indicated by its eventual surrender on the piaster
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly debatable whether this is a desirable state of affairs in
                            relations with an ally, but experience indicates that in the case of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> it may be the <hi rend="italic"
                                >only way</hi> to get urgently essential things done. If this is to
                            continue, incidentally, it is important that this changing relationship
                            not be leaked to the press, or hinted in any way in official U.S. public
                            statements. News stories with gloating headlines, e.g., “<persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at last heeding U.S. advice,”
                            would so anger the Vietnamese that emotion might once again prevail over
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s political judgments. (Which in
                            itself is a glimpse of our dilemma in dealing with the U.S. press,
                            since, of course, stories of this sort would strengthen support for U.S.
                            policy in Viet-Nam.)</p>
                        <p>Within this framework, I think the <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> report will be helpful to the Mission in
                            Saigon, at least indirectly, in reinforcing our repeated appeals for
                            better cooperation on grounds of the sensitivity of U.S. public opinion.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has long been particularly alert
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>, first because of his
                            early support for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and
                            later because of the disillusion he revealed in his speech at Michigan
                            State in the summer of 1962.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">See <ref

                            Embassy in Washington is not reporting that such doubts by a man in
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName>’s key political
                            position indicate a real possibility of a change in U.S. policy. In
                            other words, paradoxically, we may have arrived at the point where
                            negative criticism of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is almost
                            as useful in the present circumstances in Saigon as it is damaging to
                            the Administration’s defense of its policy at home.</p>
                        <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>It follows, however, that if this is the case, we are in a perilous
                            situation. We certainly can’t live on paradoxes indefinitely. Altogether
                            I think the <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report’s
                            political and psychological impact, both here and in Saigon, tends to
                            confirm its main point: that it is essential for the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to strive more vigorously than ever to

                        <p>At the staff level, a total piaster requirement for the economic program
                            has been agreed to on the order of 2.3 billion piasters. The Directorate
                            General of Budget and Foreign Aid and <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> have been: working on the details of this program, and
                            while they have not reached agreement on all details, the differences
                            are small enough that it has become, I am sure, a relatively minor

                        <p>Sources of financing for the Fund in 1963 would be (a) the unexpended
                            balance of “purchased” piasters (approximately 635 million as of January
                            1, 1963); (b) the unobligated balance of 1962 counterpart (approximately
                            200 million piasters as of January 1, 1963); (c) all newly generated
                            counterpart not committed by agreement to the military budget; (d) other
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> piasters, including VN$300
                            million “earmarked” in the National Budget for counterinsurgency, VN$100
                            million from the Lottery, and additional amounts as required to make up
                            the deficiency between the total agreed program, on the one hand, and
                            the total of (a), (b), and (c) on the other.</p>

                        <p>It is proposed that a piaster Fund for the agreed program be established
                            (a special “compte hors budget”), upon signature of a Fund Agreement.
                            The Fund Agreement would provide principally for the following: <list>

                                    establishment of the Fund. In the case of additional <gloss

                                    expeditious preparation of such agreements, the total of
                                    deposits to the tuna from all sources would not be less than 1.5

                                arise from hamlet, village, district and province requests, which

                            made at the province level and those made by national agencies or
                            departments—I propose the following procedures appropriate to each: <list>

                                <item>For expenditures made at the province level, the procedures
                                    now in use for U.S. “piaster purchase’ release agreements would
                                    be used. This procedure involves the establishing of a fund at
                                    the province level which is initially funded for only a
                                    relatively small portion of the total agreed expenditures, and
                                    is then replenished as required by expenditures under the
                                    approved plan.</item>

                                    similar to those now used for such expenditures would be
                                    employed. It has been agreed by our staffs that some
                                    improvements in these procedures might be effected on the
                                    occasion of the establishment of this Fund.</item>

                        <p>In conclusion, it should be pointed out that we recognize that the extent
                            of the liability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for this
                            fund is not a fixed one. We cannot predict precisely the amount of
                            counterpart that will become available for this purpose. There is no way
                            this can be determined in advance very definitely, since commercial
                            import program licensing rates and military budget requirements are
                            factors in the equation.</p>

                        <p>It is proposed, however, that in view of the high priority accorded by
                            both our governments to the counterinsurgency effort, that the
                            Government of Viet-Nam agree to provide from its own resources whatever
                            funds are necessary to augment previously identified contributions to
                            the fund to the extent necessary to fully fund an agreed 1963
                            expenditure program of approximately 2.3 billion piasters. And it is
                            noted that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s contribution to the
                            Fund from non-aid generated sources would not exceed as a maximum, 1.4
                            billion piasters (including the 300 million and 100 million piasters
                            referred to in II (d) above) even in the event that newly generated
                            counterpart piasters available to the Fund in 1963 were zero. This
                            assumes the contribution in excess of 200 million unencumbered 1962
                            counterpart piasters and 635 million purchased piasters. The actual
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> contribution might, of course,
                            be less.</p>
                        <p>If this proposal is agreeable to your government, I would appreciate your
                            concurrence. This would then permit our respective staffs to undertake
                            the establishment of the fund and implementation of the program.<note

                                prepared, covering roughly 1958 to mid-1962, which was “severely

                                customarily printed in unclassified form, but the State Department

                                    (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>)</note> I have not yet had
                            opportunity to read subject <gloss target="#t_GAO1">GAO</gloss> report,
                            although I understand a draft of it has reached <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss>. I would like, however, to make a preliminary comment
                            based on contents <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>For many months this Mission has been reporting steady and encouraging
                            progress in the slow and difficult counterinsurgency and pacification
                            effort here. At the same time, we have pointed out that the general
                            situation, though improving, is still fragile and subject to dangerous
                            deterioration, physical and psychological. We are not out of the woods
                            yet; the favorable trend is not irreversible. Any sign of weakening
                            could well result in another attempt to overthrow the government. The
                            predictable result of such an attempt—whether successful or not—would
                            be, in my judgment, a bonanza for Hanoi. As it now stands, continued
                            foreign press criticism of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            US policy here, followed by the Mansfield report and signs of reluctance
                            and <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0188"/>disillusionment on the part
                            of certain segments of US opinion, have without doubt encouraged coup
                            plotting, have made the govt here tighten up rather than liberalize, and
                            have encouraged the enemy. I do not think in these circumstances we can
                            afford a public chastisement of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            (and/or our own policy) by a US agency. This is not said in an attempt
                            to stifle criticism. It would, however, be totally incredible to the
                            Vietnamese people (government and non-government, friendly and hostile)
                            that the US could sustain a position with one hand and publicly slap it
                            down with the other. They would certainly interpret this as
                            foreshadowing change of US Govt policy here. In this connection, it
                            seems to me pertinent to recall the first commandment of our task force
                            instructions issued two years ago.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">An

                            basic instructions have not been changed to my knowledge. We have made,
                            and continue to make, measurable progress under them. I have a strong
                            feeling that publication of the <gloss target="#t_GAO1">GAO</gloss>

                            believe that its publication in any form would provide us leverage in
                            negotiations with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, my strong recommendation that US Government consult
                            with Congressional leaders with view to deferring publication of <gloss

                            should of course, undertake investigate and correct any specific

                            several targets which now being studied. We consider it important to
                            determine future basis for herbicide operations and to inform <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> soon so that its planning may be
                            developed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>On basis evaluation results so far, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> and I recommend that chemical defoliation and
                            crop destruction be continued (latter as integral part of more general
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> food denial program) but on new
                            footing: instead of considering chemical defoliation and crop
                            destruction as separate program under which appropriate targets can be
                            selected, herbicides should be considered as an effective tool to be
                            employed in specific situations and areas where we can determine that
                            their employment will hurt <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military or
                            supply operations. This shift in emphasis would still mean limiting crop
                            destruction operations to crops definitely identified as being grown by
                            or for <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, such as <pb n="164"
                                xml:id="pg_164" facs="0190"/>those near or in definitely established
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> secret bases (e.g., Zone D or
                            Duong-Minh-Chau Zone) and where denial those crops would magnify <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supply problems greatly and directly.
                            Similarly, for defoliation new basis would still mean limiting
                            operations to targets where we see definite and justifiable military
                            utility. In both defoliation and crop destruction, however, new emphasis
                            should mean greater dependence on views and recommendations local
                            commanders and advisers rather than on those of <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> in Saigon. This
                            should permit operations to be more directly related to local military
                            situation, thereby ensuring greater military impact.</p>
                        <p>Procedurally, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and
                            I recommend that we be given authority approve crop destruction targets
                            now, as well as authority approve other defoliation targets in addition
                            to lines of communication and related areas. We would continue report
                            operations fully to Washington with our evaluations as information
                            becomes available. Regarding selection targets, we would envisage
                            continuing same careful selection process used to date, judging
                            selections on basis existing criteria.</p>
                        <p>Regarding propaganda and political effects, implications and effects
                            present bloc campaign against “poison gas” and “noxious chemicals”
                            difficult foresee at present. However, we have no information suggesting
                            that operations carried out to date have had any measurably adverse
                            effects on local population vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> or U.S. Moreover, from our vantage point, we can see no
                            signs that bloc propaganda has tended undermine international support
                            for U.S. effort in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> or for <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government, or that it has raised
                            questions regarding U.S. moral standing or adherence to international
                            agreements. Accordingly, we recommend that use of herbicides be
                            continued on basis described above, recognizing that bloc propaganda
                            efforts will continue and likely increase as <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> are hurt. We also recommend that, in order help combat
                            bloc propaganda with truth, results of herbicide operations be included
                            in daily <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. military press
                            briefings and that reporters be given opportunity observe defoliation or
                            crop destruction missions.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Department’s paper, our records indicate trial defoliation
                            operations began August 1961 (Rt 13, Chon Thanh), and that thirteen
                            specific areas have been hit. Regarding crop destruction, as noted above
                            only about 12 hectares sprayed with herbicides in Thua Thien, bringing
                            total chemical crop destruction efforts to 312 hectares. As for military
                            effectiveness defoliation, would prefer see it described as appearing
                            have general impact on security situation although no statistical
                            results can be isolated. Again, with crop destruction, evidence of
                            military effectiveness may never be conclusive in wholly <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0191"/>measurable terms but believe Phuoc Long
                            operation validates general conclusion that <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> in Zone D hurting for food and that whatever done to
                            deny them food will add to their problems.</p>

                        <p>(This memorandum is based on a study of the above subject conducted
                            during a visit to Viet Nam from February 21 to March 14.)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi>. To demonstrate the continued use of Laos
                            as a channel for introduction of Viet Cong personnel and war material
                            into South Viet Nam, particularly since October 7 by which date all
                            foreign military personnel were to have been withdrawn from Laos under
                            the Geneva Agreement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure</hi>. Before departing Washington, I read all
                            available information on this subject. In Saigon, I reviewed more recent
                            data with the Embassy and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>. The
                            subject was discussed in detail with the <gloss target="#t_G1"
                            >G</gloss>-2 section of MAC/V. The latter has just completed a study of
                            infiltration and has submitted it to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Then, working through contacts in the Vietnamese Government I was able to
                            look over the evidence in the hands of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1"
                                >ARVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>-2 and other
                            intelligence agencies. This evidence consisted of captured weapons and
                            supplies, interrogation reports of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            prisoners and defectors, captured diaries and documents. Finally, I
                            visited a number of posts near the border and talked with Vietnamese and
                            American officers who are concerned with border control and the
                            infiltration problem.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Findings</hi>. Infiltration from North Viet Nam into
                            South Viet Nam occurred through the first eight months of 1962. It is
                            possible to demonstrate that the territory of Laos and Cambodia was used
                            for this purpose. In addition, external support for the Viet Cong effort
                            can be demonstrated in the increasing quantity of arms and equipment
                            captured <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0192"/>in South Viet Nam
                            which originated from bloc sources. These include weapons and
                            ammunition, particularly of Chinese origin, and medical supplies from
                            Communist China, North Viet Nam, Hungary and East Germany.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible, however, to prove any significant movement of
                            personnel through Laos and into South Viet Nam since September, 1962. As
                            of the date of my departure from Saigon, no <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> prisoner or defector had come into <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> hands who admitted entering South Viet
                            Nam after October 7. Informants in the Highlands and other areas have
                            reported Viet Cong moving over trails and through or near villages from
                            the direction of Laos in recent months. But hard evidence is
                            lacking.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. We cannot now prove a clear violation
                            of the Laos Agreement by demonstrating that foreign military personnel
                            crossed into South Viet Nam from Laos since October 7, 1962. Nor, in
                            fact, is there hard evidence that the elaborate program of infiltration
                            from North Viet Nam into the South continued during the past five months
                            on any significant scale.</p>
                        <p>I question, therefore, the utility at this point of producing a follow-up
                            report on this subject along the lines of the Department’s earlier white
                            paper, “A Threat to the Peace.”<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d35fn3">footnote 3, Document 35</ref>.</note> Nor do we
                            have in hand the kind of material that would make possible an effective
                            protest to the Soviets in their role as co-chairman of the Laos
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>It appears virtually certain, however, that the kind of evidence we seek
                            will become available within a reasonable time. Officials in Saigon,
                            both Vietnamese and American, are alert to the problem and can be
                            expected to report promptly any significant new evidence that becomes
                            available.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Some Observations on Infiltration.</hi></p>
                        <p>Problems of control—the people.</p>
                        <p>Control of Viet Cong infiltration into South Viet Nam depends on control
                            of the Highlands. This, in turn, means winning the confidence and
                            cooperation of significant numbers of the Highland tribes who inhabit
                            most of the area. A start has been made by the handful of able and
                            talented Special Forces teams now operating in the area. More, much
                            more, must be done if this problem is to be met even half-way.</p>
                        <p>A major disadvantage in this effort is the contempt in which most
                            Vietnamese hold the tribal peoples. This sentiment is reciprocated by
                            the Montagnard. Moreover, the Viet Cong have devoted considerable effort
                            to winning Montagnard support by both promises and threats. Some
                            Vietnamese understand the problem perfectly well and are working to
                            overcome the residue of distrust and dislike that has prevailed. <pb
                                n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0193"/>But it is going to take a major
                            effort to convince the average Vietnamese soldier, officer and
                            government official of the necessity for treating the tribesmen as
                            something more than sub-human.</p>
                        <p>The territory.</p>
                        <p>The most misleading thing we can do is to look at a political map of Viet
                            Nam and think in terms of “sealing off” the border. A topographical map
                            helps. Better still, one should fly over the vast trackless area that is
                            the Viet Nam-Laos border region. Mile after mile of mountains and steep
                            valleys unfold below you. The whole area is covered by impenetrable
                            forest growth. Now and then you see a hut, or a cluster of three of
                            four, in the middle of nowhere. The monotony is broken occasionally by a
                            open plot burned into a hillside for planting.</p>
                        <p>I visited one post where part of a Vietnamese battalion (181 men) and one
                            lonely American sergeant were stationed. Their sector was an area of
                            more than 250 square miles. Their assignment-to patrol their area and to
                            keep a 20 mile stretch of highway open and safe. A regiment might have
                            been able to do it.</p>
                        <p>At another post, a 12-man American Special Forces team had trained a
                            200-man strike force of Montagnard and a patrol group of 150. Their area
                            was 1,800 square miles.</p>
                        <p>An American officer noted: “They could put the Fourth Route Army through
                            here and we wouldn’t know it until they hit somewhere.”</p>
                        <p>No one is quite certain just where the Laos border is. Three maps of
                            different scale each show it differently with variations up to ten
                            miles.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the things we must consider when we talk of border
                            control and infiltration in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>Need for better surveillance.</p>
                        <p>If infiltration from the North and through Laos is to be controlled or
                            even restricted, it is clear that greater efforts will have to go into
                            tighter border surveillance. This calls for an accelerated effort with
                            the mountain tribesmen. One promising program in this regard is the
                            proposal to form small (five-man) patrol units to move into the large
                            unpoliced area east of the Laos border. Their job would not be to engage
                            the Viet Cong, though they would carry light arms to defend themselves.
                            Rather they would try to spot infiltration groups, report their size and
                            direction, discover the most used trails for later ambush, locate
                            feeding and rest stations, and the like. For both political and
                            practical reasons, we should seek to engage the Vietnamese in this
                            program as actively as possible.</p>
                        <p>Deep surveillance.</p>
                        <p>From the testimony of Viet Cong infiltrators and other evidence, it seems
                            certain that much of the effort depends on <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> establishments in such places as Tchepone, Saravana and
                            Atopeu. Officers on the scene <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0194"
                            />think that surveillance of these areas by small patrols would produce
                            invaluable information on the Viet Cong infiltration and supply effort.
                            Such a program of deep surveillance involves sensitive political
                            questions which must be weighed carefully. However, we should consider
                            that we are dealing with an enemy that treats such niceties with
                            contempt. If there has been no recent review of this problem, this might
                            be an appropriate time for reconsideration.</p>
                        <p>Aerial surveillance.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the program of aerial reconnaissance over suspected
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base areas in Laos and along the
                            border area was halted some time ago. U.S. officers in Viet Nam believe
                            that this amounts to tying one arm behind our back in the
                            anti-infiltration effort. Should not this matter be reconsidered?</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> aerial flights.</p>
                        <p>I heard several reports in the border areas of mysterious night flights
                            from the direction of Laos flying due East into the heart of the
                            Highlands and then returning in the direction of Laos some time later.
                            People on the scene assumed they were <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            flights and that they were either delivering key personnel or high
                            priority equipment to a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Officials in Saigon appeared not to have heard of these reports. The
                            matter should be checked carefully. If there seems to be any basis in
                            fact for the belief that some kind of air drop effort is underway from
                            Laos to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, appropriate steps to
                            intercept should be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>A downed plane from Laos carrying <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            supplies or personnel would provide us with dramatic evidence of
                            infiltration to say nothing of a clear violation of the Laos
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Nature of infiltration.</p>
                        <p>The most recent information from <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            prisoners and defectors includes some disquieting data. An increasing
                            number of infiltrees during 1962 were specialists—in antiaircraft, armor
                            and transport. This suggests a move toward much more sophisticated
                            activity than the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have engaged in
                            heretofore. The number of recoilless rifles in <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> hands has increased and there have been several reports
                            that they have 50 cal. machineguns, effective against aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Our intelligence people in Saigon are fully aware of these developments.
                            We should consider them here in assessing <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> plans and determination to counter the heightened use of
                            air and armor by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>There is, I think, a serious misunderstanding of what has come to be
                            called the “press problem in Viet Nam.” The impression has gained
                            currency in official circles that “the real story” is not being told.
                            The press has been described as negative, biased, naive, or worse. Some
                            officials believe that American reporters in Viet Nam concentrate on
                            criticism and pay slight attention to some of the promising and
                            encouraging developments.</p>
                        <p>Periodically, a story appears from or about Viet Nam which causes
                            official embarrassment. Often our reaction is to try to discover the
                            source and plug the “leak,” to order our people not to talk about the
                            subject concerned, and to think in terms of how we can “balance” the
                            account.</p>
                        <p>Blame is variously ascribed—to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s
                            lack of capability and skill in handling information problems, to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s official policy of regarding
                            anything critical of itself as treasonable or pro-Communist, to the
                            immaturity or irresponsibility of the American press, to the alleged
                            proclivity of the press toward the sensational, the negative, and the
                            critical.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Some Observations</hi></p>
                        <list>
                            <item>1. The Viet Nam story is one of great complexity and with infinite
                                shadings and nuances. There is considerably more gray than there is
                                black or white. In any situation as complicated as this, we have to
                                expect reporting—whether official or in the press—that is good and
                                bad, fair and unfair, balanced or one-sided, accurate or in error.
                                We are getting far more of the former of each of these pairs than of
                                the latter.</item>
                            <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0196"/>
                            <item>2. To ignore the many negative features of the situation in Viet
                                Nam is to dangerously delude ourselves. There is a vast multitude of
                                problems and only by recognizing them can we hope to do something
                                about them. A reporter who exposes such a problem may well be
                                opening the door to its solution.</item>
                            <item>3. <p>The quality of reporting by American newsmen from Viet Nam
                                    is, in my opinion, exceedingly good. They are young, it is true.
                                    And they are still learning their trade. But they are doing so
                                    with energy and seriousness of purpose. They spend a
                                    considerable amount of time in the provinces and the villages
                                    and with the military forces in the field. They have both better
                                    information and a better feel for the situation than many
                                    military officers and officials in Saigon.</p>
                                <p>They do not rush into print with everything they hear or know.
                                    Each one of them has on occasion not written stories he could
                                    have because he felt it would jeopardize military security or
                                    some larger interest.</p>
                                <p>They have made mistakes. None of them probably would write each
                                    of his stories precisely as he did if he were doing it over. But
                                    the same is true of any good reporter. No one in whatever
                                    profession can be very active without an occasional mistake. In
                                    general, I think that errors of fact or judgement have been no
                                    greater in reporting from Viet Nam than on any major story of
                                    this kind.</p>
                                <p>The relative youth of the reporters in Saigon is sometimes given
                                    as an explanation for alleged deficiencies in their reporting.
                                    Yet some of the most “critical” and “negative” reporting from
                                    Viet Nam in the past year or so has come from such reporters as
                                    Homer Bigart, Keyes Beech, Robert Martin, and Bob Trumbull—each
                                    of them mature, seasoned, and experienced reporters.</p>

                            <item>3. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] We can understand the problems of
                                the reporters in Saigon only by realizing some of the difficulties
                                under which they operate. I refer here to the negative attitude of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government toward
                                the foreign press. With their own press under total control, they
                                find it difficult to understand why the U.S. press is permitted to
                                travel freely and write freely. The highest officials in Saigon
                                regard the foreign reporters as a kind of fifth column in their
                                midst. The police keep careful check on where the reporters go and
                                with whom they talk. The threat of expulsion hangs over them
                                constantly.</item>
                            <item>4. The editorials of many American newspapers have been far more
                                intemperate and one-sided than any of the reporting from Saigon. A
                                phrase or a sentence in a story from Viet Nam—probably accurate in
                                the context in which it was used—is sometimes pulled out and used as
                                the basis for the most sweeping generalizations about the country,
                                its government or the military situation. There is a tendency <pb
                                    n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0197"/>to confuse reporting from
                                and about Viet Nam with editorials and other comment and to bracket
                                them all under the term “press coverage.”</item>
                            <item>5. <p>It is charged that the reporters have stressed excessively
                                    the role of American forces and personnel in Viet Nam and
                                    downgraded the Vietnamese effort. We must recognize a fact of
                                    life: any time we have 12,000 Americans in a country,
                                    particularly if they are under combat or otherwise hazardous
                                    conditions, there is going to be more interest here in how they
                                    are faring and what they are doing than in almost any other
                                    development. Also, a story from Viet Nam that mentions one or
                                    some Americans is much more likely to appear on the front pages
                                    here than a story that includes no such mention.</p>
                                <p>Many stories are written from Viet Nam that do not mention
                                    Americans directly or indirectly. It is not the reporters’ fault
                                    that they often end up as four or five paragraphs on Page
                                    15.</p>

                            <item>6. It also is unfortunately true that “bad news” is likely to get
                                more space and prominent display than stories of progress and hope.
                                A defeat is likely to win more attention than a victory. The
                                determination of space and display is made in the home office, not
                                by the reporter on the spot.</item>
                            <item>7. We cannot hope to get 12,000 Americans scattered widely over
                                the Vietnamese countryside to stop talking to reporters. It is
                                sometimes possible, particularly in the Saigon area, to limit
                                discussion of a single matter for a limited time period. Control is
                                also possible on matters to which a very limited number of people
                                have access. But efforts to get all Americans to avoid discussing
                                this or that subject are likely to prove ineffective.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>On the whole, we are likely to have more success in keeping sensitive
                            matters out of print if we give reporters the details on an “off the
                            record” basis accompanied by an explanation of why publication would
                            adversely affect our interests. This is not foolproof, of course, but it
                            is likely to be more effective than efforts at mass muzzling. This
                            approach should not be used to conceal bad news but to protect
                            information in which very real security interests may be involved.</p>

                                complaints. An occasional session with the Ambassador serves the
                                good cause of promoting better mutual understanding, but the

                            operations in Viet-Nam has been subject to continuing study and
                            refinement. The Country Team, and particularly the military members of
                            the Country Team, are to be commended for their constant efforts to
                            increase the effectiveness of our air advantage in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>However, we must never forget that this is a political war and since more
                            than a year has now passed since we began our expanded assistance to
                            Viet-Nam, we feel that we must now undertake a careful evaluation of the
                            future use of both American and Vietnamese air power against the Viet
                            Cong.</p>

                        <p>There appears to be no doubt of the great value of the increased mobility
                            which transport planes and helicopters have conferred on the <gloss

                            posts, and hamlets under attack has proved very important.
                            Reconnaissance by air is also most valuable. In the case of close air
                            support for Government-initiated offensive operations, the picture is
                            not so clear, however, and further study seems in order. But we are
                            particularly struck by the difficulties of assessment with regard to
                            interdiction missions.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to clarify the value of air interdiction missions and place
                            them in proper perspective, we have drawn up the following balance
                            sheet. We are aware that our information is incomplete. The great
                            difficulty here is that, basically, any evaluation of the usefulness of
                            air interdiction tends to become an evaluation of the temper of the
                            Vietnamese people. The difficulties of assessment do not make it any
                            less important, however. We therefore request that the Country Team
                            consider the following statement of the problem, give us their comments,
                            and wherever possible, provide us with more complete information.</p>

                        <p>We understand that U.S. piloted combat fixed-wing aircraft now fly about
                            1,000 sorties monthly. Of these, about 530 are in direct support of
                            ground actions. Over 300 of the remainder are interdiction missions.
                            These, as we understand it, are independent air strikes against ground
                            targets believed to be Viet Cong positions or bases.</p>
                        <p>Targets for interdiction missions are often inhabited. Given the Viet
                            Cong dependence upon the people, it is believed likely that many Viet
                            Cong bases and installations include numbers of persons who are not hard
                            core Communists, who are less than wholehearted supporters of the Viet
                            Cong, or who may even be basically anti-Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Joint US-Vietnamese procedures for checking targets and controlling
                            aircraft to insure that they hit the right target have been very
                            carefully worked out and refined. They are believed to be basically
                            sound. The intelligence on which targeting is based, however, comes from
                            Vietnamese sources which are often difficult to evaluate. To the degree
                            that this intelligence is faulty or imprecise, the likelihood of
                            injuring or killing civilians is increased.</p>
                        <p>We have in fact received scattered reports of civilians being injured and
                            killed by interdiction missions. Considering the difficulty in
                            separating out Viet Cong personnel from the general population, plus the
                            sources of our intelligence, this is probably to be expected. The
                            problem, then, revolves around the reactions of the Vietnamese
                            population to these injuries and deaths. We must seek to weigh popular
                            Vietnamese reactions to the civilian casualties which are inflicted by
                            air power against the value of Viet Cong casualties so inflicted.</p>

                        <p>Another, somewhat separate, but equally important factor in the problem
                            is the American presence. We have been at great pains to put strict
                            limits on our role in this war, not only for domestic reasons, but also
                            because the mere appearance of either American control or direct
                            participation in the war gives substance to the main theme of Communist
                            propaganda, i.e. that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is an
                            American puppet, that this is a neo-colonial war, and that all patriotic
                            Vietnamese must fight for their independence against the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In examining this problem the following specific factors must be
                            considered, they are set forth as arguments, of varying degrees of

                                of the most serious problems which the Viet Cong confront is how to

                                in part from the destruction of supplies by air raids.</item>

                                be progressively separated from the people, thus reducing the

                            <item>The prestige of the U.S. in Asia can be seriously damaged if it
                                becomes widely known that American aviators are killing Vietnamese
                                peasants. The Communist nations have already started to make this a
                                serious part of their propaganda campaign. We may be able to explain
                                that defoliants are weed killers, but we cannot expect to explain
                                why American pilots are using bombs, napalm, and machine guns
                                against Vietnamese peasants in a war where our role has been
                                publicly defined as limited to training, equipping, and supplying
                                the Vietnamese in the prosecution of their own defensive war. For
                                ourselves and for the Vietnamese the most important rule governing
                                our actions is to avoid steps which will create the general belief
                                that this is our war. We are already getting too close to such a
                                position.</item>

                        <p>The arguments set forth above indicate there is not a demonstrably clear
                            case either for or against interdiction missions, and this in itself is
                            a convincing argument for undertaking a review. While some of the issues
                            involved transcend the situation in Viet-Nam itself, such a review
                            requires an on-the-ground evaluation of the validity of arguments
                            advanced above, pro and con, and some indication of the respective
                            weights to be assigned them. In such an evaluation, we think the
                            intimate interaction of political and military factors must be taken
                            into account. A measure, for instance, which gave short-run military
                            advantages might in the long run be militarily disadvantageous if it
                            affected popular attitudes in such a way as to increase Viet Cong
                            ability to build larger forces and the organization required for their
                            effective support. What we would hope to determine is the net worth,
                            positive or negative, of (a) U.S.-piloted interdiction and (b)
                            interdiction missions piloted only by Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>On receipt of your comments and information, we intend to review the
                            problem thoroughly and come to a decision.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">In

                                Basic assumptions to this exercise were that <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                    >VC</gloss> insurgency would be under control by end three-year

                                will be borne out. Present progress is encouraging and holds
                                prospect of continuing in same vein, but nonmilitary aspects this
                                war can not easily be quantified or put into time period. Thus,

                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> first raised certain
                            questions and objections of relatively minor nature which he said had
                            been raised by Director of Budget and Department of Interior. Discussing
                            these, I suggested that we get our experts together in next day or two
                            to iron out any remaining differences so that proposed letter could be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> then said (asking me not
                            to report) that agreement in principle that he had previously gotten
                            from <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> had been
                            withdrawn. I asked him whether President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> had also reneged, and he said no, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was the trouble. I asked him why,
                            and he said in effect that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            had been frightened off from close collaboration envisaged in this
                            counter-insurgency proposal by the “atmosphere” now prevailing in
                                US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations. In discussing
                            this, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> repeatedly referred
                            to the doubts and misgivings engendered by the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> report, by editorial and press
                            pressures against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in America, by
                            what appeared to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to be
                            indications of US uncertainty in continued support of <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. In this connection he referred to
                            Washington Post story about Nguyen Ton Hoan and upcoming visit of
                                <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Warren Unna</persName>, whom he
                            characterized as incurably prejudiced against <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>. In short, he said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> particularly was disturbed about entering into a
                            commitment of this sort (both procedural and financial) at a time when
                            he thought he saw signs of a possible shift in US policy.</p>
                        <p>In a long discussion I attempted to disabuse him of these doubts, citing
                            recent statements by Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1"
                                >Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            and giving him my own convictions. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> commented that it was ironic that these tremors
                            should be disturbing basis of our joint endeavors at very time when our
                            team work is excellent and when real progress is being made. With this
                            comment I heartily agreed.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that, even if <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            grounds for feeling as he does, the best way to get over this period is
                            to demonstrate confidence which would in turn engender confidence; the
                            worst way would be to give USG and Congress grounds for feeling <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was holding back in committing
                            themselves to an essential part of the counter-insurgency struggle. I
                            said I would like to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            about this. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he would
                            see him again this afternoon and try to overcome his objections, and let
                            me know if he needed my assistance.</p>

                            Before making specific comments I want to set the stage first. There are
                            no hard facts here to support general theme that aerial interdiction is
                            an indiscriminate killer. Second, recognize fully that the war in
                            Vietnam is political as well as military. In fact, this point was one of
                            the essential elements in the National Campaign Plan. How ever at this
                            stage of the game the 30,000 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            casualties on the one <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0213"/>hand and
                            13,000 <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> on the other for 1962 would
                            indicate it has a distinct military flavor. Third, political attacks by
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are possible only because of the
                            active participation of their military forces. For this reason,
                            destruction of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> political
                            organization, which is essential to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            efforts to regain control and support of the people, requires
                            application of force against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            military capability which enables it to flourish. In many cases air
                            delivered munitions are the only type of force which can presently reach
                            some of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strongholds. Fourth, to
                            consider the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as merely a political
                            adversary in spite of the vicious manner and means that he employs to
                            subvert the populace is inviting disaster and accepting a degree of
                            procrastination which puts time on his side.</p>

                                    100 were interdiction. 183 (Farmgate) interdiction missions have
                                    been flown thus far in March 1963 which is indicative of the

                                    purposes. It must be pointed out that air is only one of many
                                    means to achieve interdiction; however, it attracts more
                                    attention though not necessarily inflicting more innocent

                                    artillery, surface action, etc. Further, there is no basis to

                                    to avoid civil casualties even at the expense of reduced

                        <p>In my judgment, the strategic concept that was developed for South
                            Viet-Nam remains basically sound. If we can ever manage to have it
                            implemented fully and with vigor, the result will be victory.</p>
                        <p>The concept is based on the assumption that villagers in Southeast Asia
                            are turned inward on themselves and have little or no sense of
                            identification with either the national government or Communist <pb
                                n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0216"/>ideology—that the villagers are
                            isolated physically, politically and psychologically. In such
                            circumstances, it is not at all difficult to develop a guerrilla
                            movement. In Burma during World War II, about 150 Americans created a
                            guerrilla force of 30,000 and did it with white faces. It is hardly
                            surprising that the Viet Cong could do equally well or better in South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>A corollary to this assumption is that the villager’s greatest desire is
                            security and that, if the villagers are given security, some simple
                            progress towards a better life, and—most important of all—a sense that
                            the government cares about them and their future, they will respond with
                            loyalty.</p>
                        <p>The recent <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> survey of Long An<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">Not found.</note> gives some evidence of the
                            validity of this assumption. 1,250 families were interviewed in Long An,
                            which is among the worst of the Delta provinces. The results were as
                            follows: In insecure villages, 75 percent of the people expressed an
                            attitude towards the Viet Cong and the government that was essentially
                            “a plague on both their houses”, and 25 percent of the people were
                            silent. In relatively secure villages—those which could be penetrated by
                            large Viet Cong groups but not by small patrols—50 percent of the people
                            took a “plague on both their houses” point of view, and 50 percent were
                            mildly pro-government. In very secure villages, <hi rend="italic">which
                                had also received some benefits, such as a school or a well</hi>,
                            the people were 100 percent pro-government and expressed a determination
                            to fight the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of such an apparently valid assumption, the strategic
                            concept calls for primary emphasis on giving security to the villages.
                            The tactics are the so-called oil-blot approach, starting with a secure
                            areas and extending it slowly, making sure no Viet Cong pockets are left
                            behind, and using police units to winkle out the Viet Cong agents in
                            each particular village.</p>
                        <p>This calls for the use of military forces in a different way from that of
                            orthodox, conventional war. Rather than chasing Viet Cong, the military
                            must put primary emphasis on clear-and-hold operations and on rapid
                            reinforcement of villages under attack. It is also important, of course,
                            to keep the Viet Cong regular units off balance by conventional
                            offensive operations, but these should be secondary to the major task of
                            extending security.</p>
                        <p>All this requires careful coordination of military operations, police
                            efforts and rural development towards the primary objectives: the
                            extension of security over the heavily-populated regions of the Delta,
                            the cutting off of Viet Cong sources of supplies and especially
                            recruits, <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0217"/>and their dispersion
                            into the jungles and mountains where they can be worn down by attrition,
                            starvation and more conventional military means.</p>
                        <p>At the heart of the strategic concept are two basic principles:</p>
                        <p>The first is that of the oil blot. In the past, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> sought to blanket the whole country
                            with so-called strategic hamlets which in many cases involved nothing
                            more than wire-enclosed villages doused with political propaganda, with
                            the Viet Cong agents left in place. The result was to blanket the Delta
                            with little Dienbienphus—indefensible, inadequately armed hamlets far
                            from reinforcements, that lacked both government benefits and police
                            facilities to winkle out Communist sympathizers, with Viet Cong pockets
                            left behind. In effect these were storage places of arms for the Viet
                            Cong which could be seized at any time. After November 1st, the military
                            began to demobilize some of these vulnerable villages and outposts, and
                            a race developed between the government and the Viet Cong. The race may
                            have ended in a tie, but the result is that the Viet Cong now have much
                            better weapons and greater stocks of ammunition than they ever had
                            before.</p>
                        <p>The second basic principle is that the way to fight a guerrilla is to
                            adopt the tactics of the guerrilla—night ambushes, small patrols, and so
                            on. In spite of all our pressures, this has never been done in Viet-Nam.
                            Instead, the emphasis has been on large operations, artillery and air
                            bombardments, and the use of cumbersome battalion-sized units which
                            telegraph their movements to the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of operations against North Viet-Nam, I would suggest
                            that such operations may at a certain stage be a useful <hi
                                rend="italic">supplement</hi> to an effective counterinsurgency
                            program, but they would not be an effective <hi rend="italic"
                                >substitute</hi> for such a program.</p>
                        <p>My own preference would be to continue the covert, or at least deniable,
                            operations along the general lines we have been following for some
                            months with the objective, since these are only pinpricks, not of
                            forcing North Viet-Nam to its knees but of keeping the threat of
                            eventual destruction alive in Hanoi’s mind. Then, after we had made
                            sufficient progress in the Delta so that all concerned began to realize
                            that the Viet Cong were losing the support of the population, and that
                            their ability to continue the war depended solely on North Vietnamese
                            support, I think we should indicate as much privately to the North
                            Vietnamese and follow this by selected attacks on their infiltration
                            bases and training camps.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, significant action against North Viet-Nam that is taken
                            before we have demonstrated success in our counter-insurgency program
                            will be interpreted by the Communists as an act of desperation, and
                            will, therefore, not be effective in persuading the North Vietnamese to
                            cease and desist. What is worse, I think that premature <pb n="192"
                                xml:id="pg_192" facs="0218"/>action will so alarm our friends and
                            allies and a significant segment of domestic opinion that the pressures
                            for neutralization will become formidable.</p>
                        <p>In sum, I believe that we can win in Viet-Nam with a number of
                            provisos.</p>
                        <p>The first proviso is that we do not over-militarize the war-that we
                            concentrate not on killing Viet Cong and other conventional means of
                            warfare, but on an effective program for extending the areas of security
                            gradually, systematically, and thoroughly. This will require better
                            teamwork in Saigon than we have had in the past and considerably more
                            emphasis on clear-and-hold operations and on police work than we
                            ourselves have given to the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The problem of getting effective teamwork is troublesome. Ideally, what
                            we need is what the British had in Malaya-a Gerald Templar who has
                            absolute authority to hire and fire anyone in any agency or department
                            and through whom all reporting and all orders are transmitted.</p>
                        <p>My second proviso is that there be political stability in Saigon. The
                            talk of neutralization is clearly very dangerous. It tends to be in the
                            nature of a self-fulfilling prophecy-talk about neutralization
                            disheartens those who must fully and vigorously implement the strategic
                            concept and encourages those who are plotting for a neutralist coup.</p>
                        <p>I think we can counter such dangers most effectively by the proposals in
                            my letter to you of March 14<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">Not
                                found.</note> dealing with the whole of Southeast Asia; if
                            necessary, however, we might also station a Marine battalion in Saigon.
                            Publicly, we could explain this as a move to protect American
                            dependents; privately, we could pass the word in Viet-Nam that we wanted
                            no more coupe.</p>
                        <p>To reiterate, I think that we have made the necessary and fundamental
                            policy decision on the over-all strategic concept. What remains is to
                            implement this concept vigorously and with effective coordination.</p>

                                    necessity of building confidence on the part of the <gloss

                                    matter of making it clear that we were determined to see this
                                    through. The Governor asked whether it was possible to build
                                    Vietnamese confidence in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                                        >Thompson</persName> replied that where you needed
                                    confidence most was in the villages and that it was increasing
                                    there. An index of this confidence was the fact that so much
                                    rice was getting through from the villages to Saigon. The <gloss
                                        target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might be able to export 300,000

                                    him about the advisability of reducing U.S. forces. He had
                                    replied that if progress during 1963 continued good, and if it
                                    were possible to have a white area during the summer, it might
                                    be wise to reduce U.S. strength by a significant amount, say
                                    1,000 men. This would take the steam out of Viet Cong propaganda
                                    and it would reaffirm the honesty of American intentions.</item>

                                <item>Giving the Vietnamese jets would be a small but significant
                                    escalation of the war in Viet-Nam. We would lose the ability to
                                    remove jets from Viet-Nam at any time that the international
                                    situation might make it in our interest to do so. The fact that
                                    these are unarmed jets will be overlooked by Bloc propagandists.
                                    Such a move would give the Bloc an excuse for escalation. If the

                                <item>There appears to be no need to give jets to the Vietnamese in

                                    done better if we continued to use only American piloted
                                    aircraft. The reason for this is that the T-33 is not as good
                                    for reconnaissance as the F-101 which American pilots are now
                                    using.</item>

                                <item>Giving the Vietnamese jets would be a flat and obvious
                                    violation of the Geneva Accords, which specifically prohibit the
                                    introduction of jet engines into <gloss target="#t_SVN1"
                                        >SVN</gloss>. It is true that we have already been cited for
                                    introducing jets and other war material into Viet-Nam. We
                                    continue to receive citations from the <gloss target="#t_ICC1"
                                        >ICC</gloss> each time a new violation is detected. Our
                                    policy has been to minimize the number of these citations as
                                    much as possible. This is because the <gloss target="#t_ICC1"
                                        >ICC</gloss> still has an important effect on world opinion

                                    intelligentsia. In reply to a question from the President, he
                                    said that the quality of the political opposition was very poor.
                                    He said that if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                    disappeared there would be a risk of losing the war within six
                                    months since there was no other leader of his caliber available.
                                    (After the meeting with the President, he qualified this remark
                                    by saying that as a result of the war effort there was a
                                    continuing increase in the number of competent and experienced
                                    Vietnamese officials.)</item>

                                    favor. He cited particularly the increased number of defectors
                                    (from an average of 15-20 a week in early 1962 to 148 for the
                                    week ending March 25, 1963). He cautioned that the pattern of
                                    the war would not change much, that there would be no major
                                    victories on our side, and that we had to expect as a part of
                                    the fortunes of war occasional reverses, such as the one at Ap

                                    that even when the foliage was dead, sufficient branches and
                                    twigs remained to provide hiding places for the Viet Cong. He
                                    also cited the automatic aversion of the Asians to the use of
                                    unknown chemicals. As to crop destruction, he believed this
                                    should only be carried out in a situation where it was clear
                                    that the Viet Cong had no sources of supplies other than the
                                    areas to be destroyed. The President asked that the defoliation
                                    and crop destruction programs be reviewed again.</item>

                                        in Saigon, should be expected. Such terrorism would be an
                                        admission of defeat. It would require steady nerves to
                                        endure it, particularly given the unfavorable publicity

                                    corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> on the Situation in
                                Viet-Nam</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Robert Thompson</persName>, head of the
                            British Advisory Mission to Viet-Nam, discussed with the members his
                            observations on the situation in Viet-Nam. He characterized the
                            situation as one of requiring patience and exhibiting confidence.
                            Relative to the latter, he believes that the Vietnamese have confidence
                            in the ultimate success of the war against the Viet Cong. He cautioned,
                            however, that there is the danger that we may be over-extending
                            ourselves in the strategic hamlet program, leaving pockets of Viet Cong
                            control behind to subvert and harass the peasants. He stressed the
                            importance of consolidating areas prior to pushing forward into insecure
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> observed that the
                            infiltration is not a decisive factor in Viet Cong recruitment, and that
                            only a relatively small amount of equipment comes into the country by
                            this means. It is his opinion that the solution to the infiltration
                            problem is to gain solid control at the village level with military
                            forces screening in the border areas. Once solid control in the villages
                            is gained, it will be possible to detect infiltrators as they attempt to
                            enter these secure areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> stated that it was
                            his belief that U.S. forces in Viet-Nam are adequate for the task, but
                            by the end of the year it could be possible to withdraw some of these
                            forces. This move should be made as an indication that we are winning
                            and tied into the achievement of a white area, free from Viet Cong
                            attack. He also brought out that good relations exist between the U.S.
                            and Vietnamese. However, he believes that reporting in the U.S. papers
                            on the overall effort in Viet-Nam could be improved.</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0228"/>
                        <p>He acknowledged that a weakness of the Vietnamese is that they have been
                            unable to cope with Communist penetration efforts in the Government,
                            labor, and student organizations. However, steps are being taken to
                            build up an internal security service to improve their capabilities in
                            this area.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on air strikes, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1"
                                >Thompson</persName> stated that their utilization is essential, as
                            the threat prevents the Viet Cong from concentrating to carry out
                            operations. He agreed that large scale “clear and hold” operations,
                            although they may have some value, have not obtained significant results
                            to date. He emphasized that the most effective method of operations
                            against the Viet Cong are extended operations of ranger or similar type
                            units in areas under Viet Cong control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> remarked that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is stronger in
                            the provinces than in Saigon. However, the Government is very dependent
                            on him, and if he were to fall, the whole Government would collapse. To
                            counter this possibility, we must encourage the establishment of a
                            stable administrative system operating from the Ministries down to the
                            village level, which would eventually lead to a viable government when
                            the insurgency situation abates. In conjunction with this effort,
                            planning should be initiated for demobilization, as well as increased
                            attention to programs to assist in the agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> commented that the
                            only valid bench mark to assess the effectiveness of our effort in
                            Viet-Nam is “when we reach the level of having sufficient control of the
                            population to deny their accessibility to actions by the Viet Cong.” He
                            believes we might reach this point by the middle of next year. In
                            conclusion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> stated
                            that the key to success in Viet-Nam is the population and the existence
                            of a strong government, which functions for the benefit of the people.
                            He believes that this trend is now slowly developing.</p>

                            the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, presented a summary
                            of his findings based on his recent trip to Viet-Nam. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JW1">Jorden</persName> pointed out that he was unable to
                            document and develop any hard evidence of infiltration from Laos into
                            Viet-Nam after October 1, 1962. Mr. <persName>Cooper</persName>, who has
                            just returned from Viet-Nam, stated that it was difficult to assess the
                            extent of infiltration from Laos; however, he did observe that the Viet
                            Cong are now infiltrating from the southern delta area into the northern
                            provinces. In response to a question from the Chairman, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JW1">Jorden</persName> stated it would be extremely
                            difficult to interdict infiltration from Laos, <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0229"/>but that reconnaissance and
                            surveillance operations over the border should help in determining
                            intelligence on the source of any infiltration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JW1">Jorden</persName> mentioned that he
                            believes that present press reporting out of Viet-Nam is about the best
                            that could be expected under the present circumstances. However, he
                            pointed out that efforts should be made to provide more background
                            briefings for the press in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JW1">Jorden</persName> stated that despite
                            progress and increased U.S. efforts in Viet-Nam, he did not detect on
                            his recent trip any significant signs of enthusiasm on the part of the
                            Vietnamese that the situation was getting better.</p>

                                    >Nolting</persName> assessed a proposal forwarded from the State
                                Department, which called for the establishment of three-man ethnic
                                specialist teams to prepare long-term field studies of tribal
                                minority areas in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                    >Nolting</persName> praised the idea, but suggested that the
                                techniques proposed should be considered for application in other
                                countries “which are vulnerable to Communist blandishments but which
                                have not yet been swept up in a Viet-Nam style liberation war.” In

                                    >Ibid.</hi>)</note> on Dave Nuttle’s proposals. The letter has
                            just arrived. Your comments seem wise and practical. After I have given
                            myself the pleasure of studying them more carefully I will pass them on
                            to those directly concerned. I think Dave Nuttle’s paper and your
                            comments taken together could be very usefully synthesized for use in,
                            say, similar minority problems in other underdeveloped countries.</p>

                        <p>Under the same general head, the British Embassy here tells me, as you
                            probably already know, that their team on aborigines is being formed and
                            that some of the members have, I understand, already arrived in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>On another British front the Embassy tells me that their plans and funds
                            for a medical team are in hand and that the present problem is the
                            completion of recruiting six properly qualified people.</p>
                        <p>The most helpful British development has been Bob Thompson’s visit, just
                            completed. Before dictating the necessary memoranda of conversations, I
                            thought I would give you the highlights. He saw the President this
                            morning and when queried about <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>, he said the question was not whether we could win
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> but that without
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> we would very probably
                            lose within six months. He emphasized that the quality of the opposition
                            was very poor. As to the war, he underlined the military statistics
                            which are moving in our favor (especially defections-up to 148 for the
                            week ending March 25). He played down the importance of infiltration.
                            When asked why the French had not been able to win he replied that they
                            had had no hope of getting the population on their side, but that more
                            importantly the strategic hamlet program had gone very much better than
                            we had expected. He praised the quality of the American military
                            observers and advisers. As to defoliants, he felt that even when the
                            foliage was dead it was still possible for the Viet Cong to hide under
                            the branches. He also cited as a negative factor the automatic Asian
                            aversion to unknown chemicals. He was not opposed to crop destruction,
                            provided it was carefully planned so that it really hurt the Viet Cong.
                            He emphasized the improving morale of Vietnamese military and civilian
                            officials, particularly the province chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Queried on helicopters he said they were fine to prevent large scale
                            concentrations and to surprise the Viet Cong, but that we must expect no
                            large scale victories from them. The war, he emphasized, would be won
                            slowly by brains and feet. He warned that as things turned more
                            definitely against the Viet Cong they must be expected to use more
                            terror, particularly in the form of hand grenades in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>He felt that tactical air was a key factor in preventing Viet Cong
                            concentrations and in helping villagers and armed forces engaged on the
                            ground. He was dead against strafing and bombing occupied villages since
                            this left an irremediable legacy of bitterness. He thought that the
                            present restrictions reduced the dangers of such activities. Tactical
                            air, he said was carefully controlled and the pilots understood that
                            when in doubt about bombing and strafing, they should not do it.</p>
                        <p>Throughout, he made it clear that we are winning, that we are on the
                            right track and that we should not be drawn off or man the panic station
                            if there are further incidents like Ap Bac or if press reports continue
                            to be unsavory.</p>
                        <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0231"/>
                        <p>He believed it possible that a real white area could be achieved between
                            June and August, and that if we continue to gain the upper hand it would
                            be wise for the United States to decide unilaterally and without prior
                            announcement to reduce the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> by a
                            substantial amount, say 1,000, at the end of calendar 1963. This, he
                            emphasized, would show our confidence that we are winning, would take
                            the steam out of the main Viet Cong propaganda line (that the Vietnamese
                            are a satellite of the Americans), and would reaffirm the honesty of
                            American intentions.</p>
                        <p>The President warmly congratulated Bob on his presentation and on his
                            very fine work in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a very incomplete agenda<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">Not found
                                attached.</note> showing some of the other persons he met during his
                            visit here.</p>
                        <p>I might comment that his meeting with the Governor was extremely cordial,
                            lasting an hour and 15 minutes-during which time the Governor kept his
                            hearing aid in with the volume up. This is, I believe, a record for
                            undivided gubernatorial attention. To the Governor, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> stressed the need for
                            patience and confidence.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the attitude of the Vietnamese peasants, the Secretary
                            supposed that the average Vietnamese peasant did not arise and beat his
                            breast and inquire what he could do for <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo
                                Dinh Diem</persName> that day. He recalled that as a boy on a farm
                            in Georgia they had a phone which was connected to about 30 others in
                            the neighborhood, that three rings on the phone signaled everyone to
                            pick up the instrument, and that such a signal could only mean fire, mad
                            dog, or Federal Revenue Agent.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> also made his point to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about reducing the
                            size of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> at the end of the year if
                            things continue to go well.</p>
                        <p>He made a speech at Fort Bragg.</p>
                        <p>He was also the dinner guest of the Assistant Secretary of State for Far
                            Eastern Affairs <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName>, where he
                            had a long conversation with <persName corresp="#p_UW1">Warren
                                Unna</persName>. In fact, he did so much for us these last ten days
                            in Washington that he would deserve two months home leave even if he had
                            not spent the previous ten months in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>During all of these conversations the question of the U.S. press was, of
                            course, a recurring topic. I forgot to mention that he gave a brief
                            backgrounder at the British Embassy and under strictly British auspices
                            which was attended by approximately 15-20 correspondents. The British
                            felt it had gone very well. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Roger

                            has been known to change his mind after digesting some hard facts. He
                            may do so this time, but I rather doubt it. Certainly he gave no
                            indication of so doing in course of three and one-half hour discussion
                            Thursday evening.<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">April 4.</note> In writing
                            this, I am gravely concerned and perplexed. I believe I used all the
                            ammunition and personal persuasion I had, without apparent result. He
                            seemed stoically prepared to accept all consequences of his decision,
                            was relatively relaxed and rather philosophical throughout, and gave the
                            impression of one who would rather be right, according to his lights,
                            than President. He was evidently braced for this session, well prepared
                            on details, courteous but immovable.</p>
                        <p>Several previous talks with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> had revealed increasingly stubborn objections by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, stimulated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, to our long-standing
                            proposal which had, according to <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName>, previously received <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s approval in principle. I insisted on carrying
                            matter to President after <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            finally reported his failure to convince him and after discussion of
                            issue and my instructions with <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BJL1"
                            >Brent</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I shall try to give essence of long discussion with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as accurately as possible, since
                            I believe situation now confronting us represents another perplexing
                            turn in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy with far reaching
                            implications for American policy. I have considered possibility of his
                            having misunderstood either proposal itself or consequences of his
                            refusal, and I do not believe he is under any misapprehension or
                            misunderstanding. He is apparently sincerely convinced (though
                            erroneously in my judgment) that Americans, particularly at lower levels
                            and in all branches of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> activity,
                            are, by their very number and zeal, creating within the governmental
                            structure of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and among the
                            population the impression of assuming an American “protectorate” over
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He recognized repeatedly that
                            this is neither our aim nor our desire and expressed great gratitude for
                            American generosity and intentions, but stuck to his conviction that
                            having so many Americans here is creating the impression of a U.S.
                            protectorate. Relating this to our present proposal for
                            counter-insurgency fund, he insisted that our proposal would perpetuate
                            too close a relationship in financial and procedural matters,
                            particularly on the civil side, would undermine the authority of his
                            government and its ability to make unimpeded decisions, and thus play
                            into the hands of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that I could not
                            accept his argument. I felt he must have been misinformed by persons
                            who, for some ulterior motive, were trying to break the close working
                            relationship between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and us
                            which had produced (and he admitted it) such measurable and encouraging
                            results over the past months. I pointed out to him that it was he who
                            had asked for, and received, American assistance in the <pb n="209"
                                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0235"/>very forms requested, without intention
                            or act on our part to infringe his government’s sovereignty. I asked him
                            to consider carefully and give me his answer. Did he want to eliminate
                            American help and advice at this critical time? His reply was “not
                            eliminate but reduce” (referring, I am sure, to the advice, not the
                            material aid). He insisted that the “men at the top” of our mission
                            understood the psychological and political problems, but that many
                            junior officers among such a large and increasing American contingent
                            did not, and were prone to insist upon their own ideas when they did not
                            have sufficient experience of the country, its people, its traditions,
                            and its way of doing things. He said that the resulting frustration on
                            the part of some Americans was the root cause of a great deal of
                            unfavorable publicity, and of much uncoordinated reporting to
                            Washington. So many Americans were confusing and disrupting the
                            functions of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, he said,
                            particularly at the provincial and district level. He elaborated on the
                            well-known problems of government here. He said that he had two kinds of
                            officials in the provinces: those with a “colonial mentality” and a new
                            generation of nationally-minded officials. He claimed that U.S. advisors
                            (particularly certain U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> rural
                            affairs [<hi rend="italic">garble</hi>] intelligence advisors,
                            psychological and propaganda advisors, and military sector advisors)
                            cause difficulties in the case of the colonial-minded officials by
                            assuming their responsibilities with their concurrence, and in the case
                            of the nationally-minded officials by insisting too much upon their own
                            views and causing delay and confusion. He claimed that the Minister of
                            Interior, and he personally, had received many complaints on this score
                            from provincial officials.</p>
                        <p>I challenged him to document this, and he went into many alleged cases,
                            ranging from disputes as to where small canals, roads, bridges, etc.,
                            should be placed, to conflicting ideas on strategic hamlet construction,
                            to the unwitting stimulation of corruption of Vietnamese local officials
                            when American money was passed out. On the subject of corruption, I told
                            him of one instance known to me where an American advisor had caught a
                            province chief red-handed in overpricing material for a strategic
                            hamlet, and that it was my impression that the presence of Americans had
                            resulted in considerably less chiseling than would otherwise have been
                            the case. He admitted this, and said, as he has done frequently in the
                            past, that we should report to the Minister of Interior any case of
                            corruption and he promised that it would be investigated and dealt
                            with.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the discussion, I told him that my government and this
                            mission had tried to get the very best people we could for all branches
                            of our mission. They were hand-picked, experienced people, with
                            dedication and good judgment; if these people were creating difficulties
                            of the kind he described, I could not have any hope that a different set
                            of Americans would do any better. I told him I thought <pb n="210"
                                xml:id="pg_210" facs="0236"/>that he had been deliberately misled
                            and misinformed. The first serious criticisms I had heard along this
                            line-and these only recently had come, I said, from his brother,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>. I asked him
                            whether he had carefully checked the sources of his information and
                            warned him that there were many Vietnamese, both Communist and
                            non-Communist, government and non-government, who might wish to mislead
                            him into this vital mistake. He replied calmly that he relied a great
                            deal on his brother, that he could not do all the work himself, and that
                            he trusted his brother’s judgment and integrity. He was convinced that
                            what he had said, as ungrateful as it sounded, ought to be said for the
                            sake of the country. He took full responsibility for the decision.</p>
                        <p>I told him he must realize he was striking at the root of our joint
                            cooperative effort, at what had been freely agreed between him and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> after long and
                            hard consideration; that it would be impossible, particularly given the
                            trend of U.S. Congressional and public opinion on the subject of
                            Vietnam, for us to hand out the money and equipment without genuine
                            cooperation and team-work, including advice but not ultimate control, in
                            its effective use. This, I said, applied not only to funds and equipment
                            for economic and social purposes in the rural areas (and I reviewed for
                            him these amounts and sources) but also to other American aid, including
                            military. I read to him relevant portions of reftels, and he understood
                            I told him this was a real test of confidence and that I would not
                            recommend, nor would Washington approve, a one-way street on
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>This led to a rather philosophical discussion by him of the problems of
                            American aid policy, during which he said inter alia he thought it was
                            the most generously motivated thing in history but that somehow we had
                            not yet found the key for its most effective use, particularly in highly
                            sensitive, ex-colonial, underdeveloped countries. He did not go so far
                            as <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has sometimes gone in
                            telling us how we should spend our money, but he did stress the point of
                            giving the recipient country more elbow room to run its own affairs and
                            develop its own institutions according to its own background and
                            traditions. I told him bluntly that this attitude would only arouse
                            suspicions at home, as it did in my own mind, about the political
                            motivations of his government. Was he really working for the benefit of
                            the people or, as his critics charged, to perpetuate his own regime? He
                            responded quite calmly, “look at the record of what I have done and
                            tried to do for the Vietnamese people during the past eight years”, and
                            went into a long history of land development centers, agricultural
                            credits, (both of which he claimed were opposed in one way or another by
                            American advisors at the time), and other social and economic programs.
                            I referred at this point to a trip I had made the day before to An Giang
                            Province, mentioning the large number of refugees who had come <pb
                                n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0237"/>over to the government side and
                            the measures being implemented to feed, house, and rehabilitate them. I
                            said these joint <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-US efforts seemed
                            to me to be working smoothly and effectively there as elsewhere; that
                            security in that area as in many others had been greatly improved and
                            morale lifted. I remarked that I had noticed especially how the children
                            gave the Americans a friendly signal and grin and certainly, even in
                            that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> influenced area, showed no
                            hostility. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said rather
                            sadly, “yes, that is often the case. That is what I meant by the
                            colonial mentality of the Vietnamese people. I have complaints from my
                            own officials in those areas to the effect that the people believe that
                            the Americans are now the government and disregard the authority of my
                            local officials.”</p>
                        <p>I tried to bring him back to the specific subject of the proposed
                            counter-insurgency fund. I suggested that we could do something about
                            specific cases where the advisory effort proved to be undercutting the
                            authority of Vietnamese officials. It was clearly necessary, however, to
                            establish an adequate and agreed piaster fund and procedures to carry on
                            the strategic hamlet and related programs if the gains to date were to
                            be consolidated and this struggle eventually won. This, I said, was a
                            must from my government’s viewpoint. I reviewed with him the pathfinding
                            procedures developed last year, President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>’s hard decision (contrary to our balance of
                            payments policy) to buy 10 million dollars worth of piasters, the
                            successful experience to date with this fund and procedures. I reviewed
                            with him the concept and origin of provincial rehabilitation plans; how
                            they were developed by his own officials, screened and approved by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu’s</persName> Ministerial
                            Committee on Strategic Hamlets, passed to the U.S. Committee on Province
                            Rehabilitation with a request for support. I showed him that these plans
                            were generally accepted by the U.S. committee without appreciable
                            change, and that there were absolutely no grounds for the contention
                            that the US was usurping planning and executive functions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at any echelon. He admitted this, but
                            insisted that some of our people in the field, particularly on the
                            civilian side but also some sector advisors, were undoing the good work
                            done by the committees, creating interference and playing to the
                            colonial-minded Vietnamese and hence into the hands of the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Upon my insistence upon specifics, he
                            finally said he felt the real trouble was that we had too many people
                            here, advising in too much detail on too many matters, and that the
                            remedy was to gradually cut back the number of people, thus “restoring
                            control at the top”. I told him that I could not accept the implication
                            that our people were freewheeling and out of control nor that there was
                            uncoordinated reporting. I did not think it was true. We certainly had
                            no desire to flood his country with Americans, and there might be some
                            possibility of reducing the number; but certainly, considering our
                            investment here, we <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0238"/>had to have
                            eyes and ears, as well as an advisory voice. Our support in its present
                            dimensions would not be possible otherwise. With respect to the subject
                            fund, we were asking two things: A commitment by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to fill a limited gap for agreed
                            counter-insurgency work, and procedures along the lines already proven
                            to be effective. I asked whether his objections to this were financial,
                            political or what. He said they are not financial; that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was prepared to provide from its own
                            resources or borrowings whatever seemed to it to be necessary to
                            continue vigorously the strategic hamlet and rural development
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>It could not, however, accept an American voice or control over the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s own resources. This, he said,
                            would be interpreted throughout his government and by all Vietnamese as
                            Vietnam’s becoming a “protectorate”. I pointed out that we were in fact
                            under this proposal asking for a voice with respect to about 1.3 billion
                            piasters of Vietnamese origin, whereas the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> had been exercising for years a voice-and a predominant
                            one-in the expenditure of U.S. funds now running at the rate of some 36
                            billion piasters per year. I found it impossible to accept his
                            reasoning. He said simply that this was one of the problems involved in
                            giving aid. I asked him what he intended to do. Did he wish to abolish
                            the present procedures for approving projects and dispensing funds in
                            the provinces? He said that he did not wish to abolish those procedures
                            insofar as U.S. funds were concerned, but he could not see his way clear
                            to extending them over <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s own funds.
                            I said this was the nub of the problem, and that we were not prepared to
                            go ahead on the present effort unless it could be overcome. He said
                            again that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would supply adequate
                            funds for counter-insurgency but had to have control of them itself. We
                            could verify their expenditures had been made; <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                        <p>Before leaving, I told the President, as a friend and a supporter of his,
                            I was bound to say that his decision, in my opinion, would result in a
                            downward spiral of Vietnam-American confidence, would result in
                            curtailment of U.S. aid, and really threaten to wash out the gains made
                            over the last year and a half. I asked him to reconsider. He said that
                            he had thought hard about this matter, that he knew our policy was well
                            motivated, but he could not accept this proposal. His reasons were in a
                            nutshell that it would be considered by the Vietnamese people, both in
                            form and execution, as proof of the establishment of a U.S.
                            “protectorate”. I repeated that I could not accept his reasons and <pb
                                n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0239"/>that, in my opinion, he was by

                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s rejection of our proposal for
                            counter-insurgency fund, most significant point is that grounds advanced
                            for rejection approach repudiation of concept of expanded and deepened
                            U.S. advisory effort, civil and military. This concept was fundamental
                            element our agreement with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            December 1961 on greatly stepped up U.S. assistance effort. Progress
                            made since that date would not have occurred, in our view, without
                            massive advisory effort, nor do we believe it can be maintained if
                            drastic reduction made at this stage in number of advisors, particularly
                            in provinces and with smaller military formations-which are precisely
                            areas where <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> seems to find
                            most difficulty. We would not deny that some advisors may, on occasion,
                            have acted in way to cause complaint or that their number and zeal have
                            reached point where, to those who want to see it that way, there are
                            similarities with a “protectorate” situation. Point is we don’t think
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can win without U.S. advisors in
                            roughly present density for the next year at least.</p>
                        <p>We also gravely doubt that momentum of strategic hamlet program can be
                            maintained and, especially, gains already made consolidated without
                            piastre fund of roughly size we have proposed and procedures for its use
                            as effective as those we have had for purchased piastres. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> says <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will make necessary funds available, he
                            is probably thinking of much smaller sum than we are (very likely the
                            400 million piastres already earmarked by <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> vs 1300 million in our proposal) and it is clear that
                            he is not thinking of procedures which would give us satisfactory voice
                            in use of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss><pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214"
                                facs="0240"/>funds. (He probably wants to revert to former
                            unsatisfactory <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> procedures.) In
                            short, we conclude that unless we can get something comparable to what
                            we have proposed, there is grave risk that strategic hamlet program will
                            founder. Without successful strategic hamlet program, it will take
                            longer to get insurgency under control.</p>
                        <p>If this is correct evaluation of significance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s position, we see no viable
                            alternative to taking action (or possibly series of actions) designed to
                            convince <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that we mean
                            business—notwithstanding grave risk that such action (a) will not move
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> but on contrary lead to
                            retaliatory action and descending spiral our relations and (b) might
                            light coup fuse. (We continue have no grounds to believe that coup would
                            bring to power a government more likely to win the war than <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. On contrary, we think a coup,
                            either accomplished or abortive, would weaken chances of preserving
                            independence of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>Unless tactical move prescribed at end this message bears fruit, first
                            action we would recommend is to inform <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> that we are revising counterpart support to <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military budget downward by, say, 1.3
                            billion piastres (from 7.5 billion) and are tentatively earmarking this
                            sum for support to strategic hamlet program. This would be very r
                            serious matter for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but action not
                            irreversible if <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> comes
                            around and would not involve dislocations inherent in cancelling orders
                            for hamlet materials, for example. Moreover, it is in any case going to
                            be necessary to reduce counterpart allocation to military budget (if
                            joint fund is not approved), simply in order to provide funds to carry
                            on minimum existing economic projects and for <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> operating expenses.</p>
                        <p>In informing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> of above, we
                            would at same time offer (a) to review advisor situation with view to
                            seeing what reduction can be made and (b) to replace any advisor who
                            abuses his position or undermines <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            authority. Finally, as earnest our firm intention to phase out special
                            military assistance, would give him detailed briefing on 3year
                            comprehensive plan (request authority to do this).</p>
                        <p>Before taking step of informing <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> of reduced support for military budget, believe it
                            advisable for tactical reasons to ask him to give me written response
                            our proposal for counter-insurgency fund, to include reasons for
                            rejection. This move would provide time for him to reflect on
                            consequences his decision and for members his government to work on him
                            if they are disposed to do so. I might also use this period for further
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and others in
                            course of which I might draw on arguments in immediately preceding
                            paragraph. Meanwhile, we would quietly hold up approval of military
                            budget support level and any new allocations of funds.</p>

                        <p>The eighth Ministerial meeting of the Council of the Southeast Asia
                            Treaty Organization (<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>) was held
                            in Paris, April 8-10, under the chairmanship of French Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMM1">Maurice Couve de Murville</persName>.
                            Secretary of State Dean Rusk led the United States delegation to the
                            meeting. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> addressed the
                            Council on April 8 and gave a guardedly optimistic assessment of
                            developments in Vietnam: “In Viet-Nam, although the struggle has
                            intensified since our 1961 meeting, the Viet Cong drive has been
                            blunted, and there are some grounds for further encouragement. We
                            believe that Viet-Nam has now found the right strategy for meeting the
                            Viet Cong terrorism and is applying it with increasing vigor.”</p>
                        <p>The communique issued by the Council at the conclusion of the meeting on
                            April 10 was similarly optimistic. The Council noted reports of
                            considerable progress in the fight against subversion in Vietnam, and
                            expressed the hope that “Viet-Nam, with the support given to it, would
                            be in a position to maintain its advance towards internal stability and
                            international security.” For texts of <persName corresp="#p_RD1"

                            closely on this, he said that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> had not specifically agreed to the amount, but he
                            felt that he could persuade him to state this in terms. I asked, under
                            what procedure would <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s contribution
                            be expended. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> replied,
                            under special fund set up for this purpose, not subject to bureaucratic
                            red tape, for allotment to province chiefs in manner similar to that
                            employed in Phu Yen Province prior to establishment of U.S. special
                            fund. (We believe this can be made to work, but will require further
                            negotiation and effective understanding.)</p>
                        <p>In general diagnosis of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            position last week and reasons therefor, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> said that President was emotionally worked up by a
                            number of reports (some true, some partly true, and some false)
                            concerning Americans’ activities coming to him at the same time. He
                            listed a number of these, and I agreed, of course, to look into each
                            one. He agreed with me (and said <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> now does, too) that these relatively minor matters
                            do not justify “pouring out the baby with the bath”, the one point on
                            which <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he had no hope
                            of persuading <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was to
                            continue the procedure of approving expenditures and dispensing funds of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> origin through the existing
                            province committee of three (generally the Province Chief, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> sector advisor, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> provincial representative). I said I
                            could see no reason to dispense with this provenly effective mechanism.
                            I saw considerable danger in falling again into the time-consuming
                            procedures of prior years, and there was not time for this. I further
                            stated that a good province chief would find, in my opinion, no
                            difficulty in such an <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0244"
                            />arrangement, since he would have the initiative and should exercise
                            it. I also said, that without such an arrangement, I could not see how
                            proper coordination could be achieved between the arrival of U.S. goods
                            (both <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss>) and the parallel requirements for piaster
                            expenditures. I said that fundamentally the difference between us seemed
                            to be this: that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, under
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu’s</persName> theory, seemed
                            to expect the Vietnamese peasants to pull themselves up by their own
                            bootstraps when they have no shoes; we, to contrary, felt that they must
                            be given, either in money or in kind, some inducement to work for the
                            government’s cause. This did not have to be lavish, but it had to be
                            something. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> admitted the
                            difference in philosophy, but stuck to his point that he could not
                            persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to continue the
                            three-party arrangement in the provinces using <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> funds.</p>
                        <p>I told him that, while he was not sure of being able to persuade his
                            government on the basis of the above, I was less sure of being able to
                            persuade mine. Nevertheless, hoped with him to be able to work out a
                            satisfactory arrangement to continue the joint effort, and I was
                            encouraged by what he had told me of the relaxation in President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s attitude. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, who was in process of drafting
                            at <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s request a reply to my
                            letter of March 18, said he would make this as “good” as he could and
                            hoped to get it signed promptly. I said I felt we could work out the ad
                            hoc and ad hominem problems as they arose, but the main thing was to be
                            sure that we understood each other and had confidence each in the
                            intentions of the other. Without this, no compromise would work. He
                            reiterated that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had no
                            intention of suggesting a change in basic relations at this time,
                            although he realized that he had conveyed that idea. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said “the trouble is that we
                            have a lot of people with a lot of views, not a coordinated
                            government”.</p>

                                <item>Purpose of informing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of

                                    impress on them seriousness with which we regard their rejection
                                    of <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> fund proposal and to do
                                    this in such a way as to create minimum dislocations if tactic
                                    has intended effect. That is, if <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                                    satisfactory compromise, we could revert to status quo ante on

                                        >GVN</gloss> does not come around, we think it is improbable
                                    that they would cooperate on use of transferred counterpart
                                    funds in accordance our desires. On contrary, they might also
                                    retaliate, for example by additional restrictions on advisers.
                                    In other words, as we sought to indicate in our 888, this is
                                    exceedingly risky step and chances success we think about

                        <p>On April 10, 1963, the National Security Council met to consider problems
                            in Laos and South Vietnam. At the request of <persName corresp="#p_BMG1"
                                >McGeorge Bundy</persName>,-the Department of State prepared and
                            circulated to the National Security Council a briefing paper which
                            outlined the problems to be considered by the Council. (Memorandum of
                            telephone conversation, April 8; Library of Congress, <persName

                            March-April-May-1963) The problem at issue in Vietnam was identified in
                            the paper as “an apparently critical situation” which had developed
                            concerning the Counter-Insurgency Piaster Fund established in 1962. The
                            paper traced the dispute over the question of joint supervision of the
                            fund, and concluded: “It now seems probable that a reasonable and
                            effective compromise can be worked out in the field which will provide
                            for appropriate Vietnamese funding contributions and adequate U.S.
                            advisory representation in the Counter-Insurgency Program.” (Memorandum

                        <p>The National Security Council limited its discussion on April 10,

                            in light of the assurance received from Saigon in telegram 893 (<ref

                                >Harriman</persName> added, “it was decided that the Ambassador and

                                that an important current of “revisionism” thought was moving with
                                increasing strength throughout various departments of the Government
                                of Vietnam, within the armed forces, and in such semi-private
                                organizations as the Republican Youth. It was not clear as to what
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> meant by
                                “revisionism”. He seemed to imply that a general reexamination of
                                the processes and performance of government in its broadest sense
                                was taking place-a self-criticism and self-examination. [<hi

                                    <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that part of
                                this process represented an effort to grapple with the problem of
                                “control”. He said that in developed societies with a tradition of
                                democratic control, absorbed by the citizenry during early youth,
                                such institutions as a free press, free association and assembly,
                                democratic political institutions, and free universities contribute
                                to democratic control of the society. However, in the underdeveloped
                                state of war-time South Vietnam, other forms of control are
                                necessary. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> did not define
                                these other forms of control but gave the impression of making an
                                exploratory effort toward locating and applying control measures. He
                                repeated several times that the objective was to achieve “liberty,
                                fraternity, and justice.”</item>

                                revisionist thought and of the control problem lay in the problem of
                                relationship between the province chief and the central government,
                                especially the ministries. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> feels that province chiefs have acquired too
                                much power, usurping “illegal power” to a degree which results in
                                local abuses and lack of a sufficiently coordinated and disciplined
                                governmental process. Province chiefs are not sufficiently
                                responsive to the various ministries of the central government. He
                                cited relationships between the Ministry of Finance and the province
                                chiefs and said that the Ministry of Finance had inadequate control
                                of the discharge of fiscal responsibilities by a province chief in
                                his province. Province chiefs were also insufficiently responsive to
                                the Ministry of Interior.</item>

                                performance of these ministries. And he claimed that similar
                                self-examination is taking place within the armed forces. He
                                mentioned his growing interest in psychological warfare as conducted
                                by the armed forces and said that psychological and political
                                warfare consciousness and practice within the armed forces cannot be

                                trained specialists within the armed forces. Trained specialists
                                tend to be ignored by their commanding officers and consequently
                                fail to achieve the objectives sought. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu’s</persName> thesis is that psychological and political
                                warfare consciousness within the armed forces must be obtained by
                                training the commanding officers themselves from general staff
                                officers and corps commanders on down to the various echelons of
                                command. This program has already been started and <persName

                                the American economic aid problem and said that he thought some

                                elimination in the long run, some forms of aid should be programmed
                                for elimination in the short run, and some aid could be eliminated

                            <item>On American presence in South Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> repeated his view that it would be useful to
                                reduce the numbers of Americans by anywhere from 500 to 3,000 or
                                4,000. He said that when the Americans first arrived, the Vietnamese
                                had a particular respect for them because the Americans were very
                                hard-working, disciplined, and without “rancor” among themselves or
                                toward other persons. However, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> feels that the process of discipline has broken
                                down with the passing of time and the numerical increase of the
                                American presence in South Vietnam. He repeated that the influx of
                                Americans and their stationing in the provinces had been welcomed
                                with the thought that Americans located in the provinces would come
                                to understand the <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0250"

                                said that he wanted to avoid “institutionalizing” certain

                            <item>According to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has received a
                                considerable flow of complaints and statements of irritation from
                                his military and civilian chiefs about problems of relationships
                                with American counterparts. He cited General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> as being among these
                                officials and claims that General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1"
                                    >Dinh</persName> had commented to the effect that there were too
                                many Americans in South Vietnam. Complaints had come in from the
                                Joint General Staff. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                                volunteered his recognition that one advantage of the American
                                presence at all echelons was to help keep Vietnamese officials
                                honest and stimulate them into better performance as Vietnamese
                                officials did not want to look bad in the eyes of a foreign officer.
                                The Vietnamese officials were at a disadvantage with respect to
                                their American opposite numbers as the Americans controlled the
                                “means”, that is, the funds and goods. This contributed to the sense
                                of inadequacy and inferiority felt by Vietnamese officials. In this
                                connection and in passing, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> cited as an example the allegation that U.S.
                                Special Forces were directly distributing funds and goods instead of
                                doing so though Vietnamese authorities.</item>

                                He said that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Le Quang
                                    Tung</persName> had made some criticisms and <persName

                                and “smoking his pipe”. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> had recently called down both <persName

                                problems relating to the construction of the long earthen wall, “the
                                Maginot Line”, as a defensive measure in the province of Vinh Long.
                                This had been an initiative on the part of <pb n="225"
                                    xml:id="pg_225" facs="0251"/>the province chief and had not been
                                cleared with the Interministerial Committee on Strategic Hamlets.
                                When <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> called the province
                                chief in for an explanation, the province chief justified the
                                project and said that American opposition was based on personal
                                antagonism to him. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                                described the province chief as having made an effort to put the
                                problem on a “nationalist” basis. He allowed the province chief to
                                make his presentation in defense of the project before the
                                Interministerial Committee and then asked the Regional Delegue for
                                his view, which turned out to be in support of the province chief.
                                After examination, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> ruled
                                against the project on the basis of effectiveness alone and then

                            have declined on grounds press of work previously accepted invitation
                            from Madame <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> to spend

                            recent directive from Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            to Women’s Solidarity Movement urging members not to show gratitude for

                            impugns motives of givers of aid, charging that some of latter believe
                            their position gives them right to destroy “our customs and habits and
                            healthy laws” and that they are using their position “to make lackeys of
                            Vietnamese and to seduce Vietnamese women into decadent paths”.

                            session. Believe our talk eased situation further and perhaps paved way
                            for satisfactory resolution of problem of counter-insurgency fund,
                            although this remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p>Told him first of Department’s instructions received Sunday<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d91fn4">April 14. The instructions have not been

                        <p>Then repeated reasons for our continued concern to settle promptly
                            question of adequate Counter-Insurgency Fund and procedures to go with
                            it, so that other important financial segments of U.S. support could
                            move forward without interruption. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> said letter we had requested was being prepared by
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> and said he would act
                            on it promptly. I told him thing which concerns us most were reasons
                            that he had given for turning down our proposal. These seemed to amount
                            to desire substantially to reduce American advisory effort in Vietnam. I
                            hoped that upon reflection he would agree that time was not yet ripe for
                            curtailment of advisory effort in any sector. I said we understood his
                            problems, had already looked into some of complaints he had made, and
                            would look into them all on case-by-case basis. I had certain procedures
                            to suggest for remedying these matters. What we could not agree to was a
                            wholesale reduction of advisory effort at this juncture while continuing
                            large [<hi rend="italic">scale</hi>] physical and financial aid,
                            although nothing would please us more than to arrive at a stage as soon
                            as possible when reductions of U.S. advisors would be possible without
                            loss of momentum. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has
                            evidently backed off considerably from his original position and, after
                            some conversation, made it clear that he now does not insist upon
                            withdrawals of U.S. personnel, but rather upon a concerted effort to
                            make advisory system work better. He went into several new types of
                            complaints from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials,
                            concerning both military and civilian matters, which I will not detail
                            here. I suggested that we should work out with <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, for submission to him,
                            possible remedial measures: A small group to look into such complaints
                            on a case-by-case basis; frequent or regular meetings <pb n="228"
                                xml:id="pg_228" facs="0254"/>between himself and me or General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> (or both) to take up
                            matters before they reached a crisis stage; perhaps a directive to all
                            of our advisors in the field and to all their counterparts in Government
                            of Vietnam detailing certain responsibilities and other matters to
                            clarify relationships and functions. He thought these suggestions were
                            good, and we will proceed to work them out with <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>. My guess is that we can
                            continue to take the heat out of this matter. We will, of course, have
                            to see to what extent he will in fact drop his previous demands and work
                            out satisfactory compromise on counter-insurgency funding and
                            procedures.</p>
                        <p>I then requested to speak frankly on delicate question of public (or
                            semi-public) statements, principally by Madame <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, which had caused
                            misunderstanding and resentment among Americans here and had become
                            cause of real morale problem on our side. I related this to need for
                            “more goodwill and understanding” which he had mentioned in connection
                            with the U.S. advisory effort. I cited Madame <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> recent communique to Women’s
                            Solidarity Movement,<note n="5" xml:id="d91fn5">See <ref target="#d89"
                                    >Document 89</ref>.</note> and read certain passages which were
                            invidious to Americans. I told him that none of our principal officers
                            wished to be in position of seeming to agree with or condone such
                            statements, and for that reason General and Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> and my family and I had
                            reluctantly declined our previously planned visit to Dalat at the
                            invitation of <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName>. I said
                            we had declined ostensibly on grounds of business here, but I wanted him
                            to know privately that a major factor was the communique referred to. He
                            seemed to understand this position, and after some discussion said he
                            would do what he could to prevent a repetition. In course of this
                            discussion, in which he at first defended <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1"
                                >Madame Nhu</persName> while admitting she was prone to overstate, I
                            had opportunity to stress point that such statements were not only
                            damaging in America, but in Vietnam as well. They encourage the very
                            form of criticism by Americans which he had complained against and could
                            in fact bring about a dangerous situation in which the “volatile
                            Vietnamese” (to use his phrase) might get out of hand. This, I thought,
                            might take one of two directions-either against Americans or against
                            those who were apparently driving wedges between Americans and their
                            Vietnamese friends.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It is too early, I think, to know how
                            this rather sensitive matter will turn out. At any rate, I felt
                            compelled to insist that he exercise his responsibility in this matter
                            and President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, initially at
                            least, received it in the spirit intended.</p>
                        <p>Our further conversation concerned various matters of some importance to
                            progress of events here. I found <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> optimistic and apparently thinking in terms of
                            moving in right directions on political <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229"
                                facs="0255"/>side. He spoke of reviewing dossiers of political
                            prisoners for public trials in near future, of organizing village
                            elections and subsequently Provincial Council elections. I urged him to
                            press on with these matters, which would give new demonstration of
                            direction of his policy. He said he would do so. He closed conversation
                            by proposing several trips with General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> and me.</p>

                        <p>On April 17, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            issued in Saigon what became known as the “Chieu Hoi proclamation.”
                            (Chieu Hoi translates into English as “Open Arms.”) The proclamation
                            reads, in part, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Based on the ideal of Personalism and the spirit of Brotherhood
                                    and Justice, the policy of Chieu Hoi sets forth the measures and
                                    methods to be applied to these elements who have been tricked,
                                    terrorized, exploited by the communist bandits, and who,
                                    becoming enlightened, (seek of their own volition to) come back
                                    to present themselves (to the authorities) to serve the National
                                    Government.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The proclamation established a “Chieu Hoi Sub-Committee,” directly
                            responsible to the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Hamlets,
                            with the duty of carrying out the policy “by reaching from the hamlets,
                            to the districts, to the provinces, to the towns, to the Capital.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> concluded the
                            proclamation by calling on all persons who had been “flattered and

                                which stated that the President would like an up-to-date report on
                                the results of defoliation and crop destruction carried out by the
                                Armed Forces, Republic of Vietnam. He suggested that the views of
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this subject be coordinated into a
                                single State/Defense/US Information Agency paper for the President.
                                Certain guidelines were furnished which have been followed in this
                                memorandum.</item>

                            <item>Two separate herbicide programs have been in progress during the
                                past year and a half in the Republic of Vietnam. In order to
                                increase visibility and deter Viet Cong ambush, a total of 87 miles
                                of roads, canals and areas bordering military installations were
                                sprayed with defoliants. Trial crop destruction operations were
                                conducted against Viet Cong crops in two areas, 750 acres of Phuoc
                                Long Province and 29 acres in Thua Thien Province.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>As in other weapons systems, a precise statistical determination
                                of the military effectiveness of defoliant operations in terms of
                                enemy losses or as a deterrent to his operations is difficult.
                                Technical reports received from the field thus far, however, provide
                                ample evidence that they do give us a degree of military advantage.
                                Specifically, defoliation facilitates clearing of rights of way
                                along rail lines, retards jungle growth, and thereby makes enemy
                                concealment more difficult while improving our reconnaissance and
                                ability to see the enemy. The Joint Chiefs of Staff conclude that
                                defoliation contributes to the improvement of the security situation
                                and that it is one tool of many in the counter-insurgency
                                kit.</item>

                            <item>Crop destruction operation in Phuoc Long Province adjacent to Viet
                                Cong War Zone D is estimated to have resulted in the destruction of
                                over 700,000 pounds of rice or roughly enough to feed 1,000 Viet
                                Cong for one year. Militarily and technically, the results were
                                excellent. The actual operation was conducted entirely by
                                Vietnamese. This <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0257"/>operation
                                was a military success in that it increased the Viet Cong food
                                problems in the area and concurrently added to over-all logistic
                                difficulties in the Viet Cong Zone D area.</item>

                            <item>In Thua Thien Province, only 29 out of 296 target acres have been
                                attacked with herbicides. This was a hand-sprayed operation carried
                                out on an experimental basis which in part accounts for the low
                                percentage of total area sprayed. Consequently, a full evaluation of
                                this operation is not yet available. However, initial reports citing
                                the destruction of 56,000 pounds of food give every evidence that
                                the success achieved in Phuoc Long will be repeated.</item>

                                missions. Efforts have been initiated in Saigon in this matter. In

                            <item>We believe that Communist progress has been blunted and that the
                                situation is improving. Strengthened South Vietnamese capabilities
                                and effectiveness, and particularly US involvement, are causing the
                                Viet Cong increased difficulty, although there are as yet no
                                persuasive indications that the Communists have been grievously
                                hurt. (Paras. 27-28)</item>

                            <item>We believe the Communists will continue to wage a war of
                                attrition, hoping for some break in the situation which will lead to
                                victory. They evidently hope that a combination of military pressure
                                and political deterioration will in time create favorable
                                circumstances either for delivering a coup de grace or for a
                                political settlement which will enable them to continue the struggle
                                on more favorable terms. We believe it unlikely, especially in view
                                of the open US commitment, that the North Vietnamese regime will
                                either resort to overt military attack or introduce acknowledged
                                North Vietnamese military units into the south in an effort to win a
                                quick victory. (Paras. 29-31)</item>

                            <item>Assuming no great increase in external support to the Viet Cong,
                                changes and improvements which have occurred during the past year
                                now indicate that the Viet Cong can be contained militarily and that
                                further progress can be made in expanding the area of government
                                control and in creating greater security in the countryside.
                                However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to
                                project the future course of the war with any <pb n="234"

                                yet to be fought and no quick and easy end to the war is in sight.
                                Despite South Vietnamese progress, the situation remains fragile.

                                in the countryside, upon which the insurgency has fed. However, the
                                government’s capacity to embark upon the broader measures required
                                to translate military success into lasting political stability is
                                questionable. (Paras. 33-35)</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">The Outlook</hi>. Whether the Communists are
                                correct in their appraisal will, of course, depend in some measure
                                upon the extent and nature of US involvement, but primarily upon the
                                South Vietnamese response to the developing situation. We do not
                                believe that it is possible at this time to project the future
                                course of the war with any confidence. Despite <gloss
                                    target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> progress, the situation remains
                                fragile. A series of major Viet Cong successes, should they occur,
                                might have a shattering psychological effect. Nevertheless, the
                                heavy US involvement and close working relationships between US and
                                Vietnamese personnel have fundamentally altered the outlook. Changes
                                and improvements have occurred during the past year which for the
                                first time indicate that the Viet Cong can be contained militarily
                                and that further progress can be made in expanding the area of
                                government control and in creating security in the countryside.
                                However, some areas of Viet Cong control, such as the Mekong delta,
                                will be very difficult to pacify, decisive campaigns have yet to be
                                fought, and no quick and easy end to the war is in sight.</item>

                            <item>Developments in the last year or two have also gone some distance
                                in establishing a basis for winning over the peasantry and in
                                improving the efficiency of the military establishment and the
                                civilian bureaucracy. It can, of course, be argued that only a
                                highly centralized regime, single-mindedly dedicated to
                                independence, and placing a heavy emphasis on personal loyalty can
                                cope with the problems of guerrilla warfare. However, we believe
                                that a greater willingness on the part of the regime to enlist the
                                active support of those who have become disaffected or discouraged
                                in the face of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                                techniques of government would considerably speed the reduction of

                            <item>Substantial reduction of Viet Cong military power, however, would
                                probably intensify rather than reduce the need for changes in the
                                philosophy and practice of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> regime, if revived insurgency were to be
                                precluded and military victory translated into political
                                consolidation. The achievement of physical security in the
                                countryside would in itself satisfy a major political requirement in
                                convincing the peasants of the government’s ability to protect them.
                                But the government must be both willing and able to expand its
                                efforts to bring social, political, and economic improvements to the
                                countryside if the peasant is to recognize a stake in the survival
                                of the government and to be fortified against Communist
                                blandishments. Effective action in this and other fields,
                                particularly with the removal of a substantial US presence at all
                                levels of the government, would almost certainly require a wider
                                participation in the development and implementation of policy and a
                                considerable reduction in the tight, personal control of the
                                bureaucracy.</item>

                        <p>Defoliation trials have been carried out in thirteen localities,
                            beginning in August of 1961 (see attached map<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2"
                                >Not found attached.</note>). About 87 miles of communication lines
                            have been cleared plus a number of areas around military installations.
                            The purpose of these operations is to increase visibility, thus
                            providing better fields of fire and reducing the possibility of
                            ambushes.</p>
                        <p>The military effectiveness of defoliation is difficult to assess. Some
                            statistics suggest curtailed Viet Cong activity as a result of
                            defoliation operations, but the evidence is inconclusive. Saigon reports
                            that these trials appear to have a general impact in the security
                            situation, but no statistical results can be isolated. While visibility
                            is without question improved by defoliation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TBRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName> and some of our own
                            military say the remaining tree trunks, limbs and twigs often provide
                            quite adequate cover.</p>
                        <p>It is our understanding that ambushes generally make use of terrain
                            features rather than foliage for cover in any event. Moreover, hand
                            cutting would seem simpler, more effective, and probably less expensive
                            in those areas where it is important to clear fields of fire. Thus
                            defoliation appears to be a useful tactic only in those instances where
                            very special terrain features justify it, and we anticipate that such
                            situations are and will be rare.</p>
                        <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>Proposed plans for future defoliant operations include the clearing of
                            the railroad right of way—according to our Embassy primarily for proper
                            maintenance and only secondarily for security. In addition, <gloss
                                target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> is now studying defoliant
                            targets totaling 12,000 acres. The Vietnamese armed forces are also
                            selecting and evaluating additional targets for the coming growing
                            season, the major portion being in Central Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Crop Destruction</hi></p>
                        <p>To date two chemical crop destruction operations have been carried out in
                            Viet-Nam, one by air in Phuoc Long Province in November of 1962 and one
                            by hand in Thua Thien Province in February of this year (see attached
                            map). In the Phuoc Long operation 300 hectares, primarily rice, were
                            sprayed with the probable loss to the Viet Cong of 356,000 pounds of
                            food or enough to support 1,000 men for six months.</p>
                        <p>In Thua Thien, because of difficult terrain and Viet Cong response, only
                            12 of the planned 120 hectares were actually sprayed, with an additional
                            20 hectares being destroyed by hand. Initial reports indicate about
                            56,000 pounds of food, primarily manioc, were destroyed by herbicides in
                            the Thua Thien operation.</p>
                        <p>Total for both the Phuoc Long and Thua Thien operations was 312 hectares
                            or about 412,000 pounds of food—enough to support 1,000 men for seven
                            months.</p>
                        <p>As in the case of defoliation, the military effectiveness of crop
                            destruction is difficult to measure. There is good evidence that the
                            Viet Cong are short of food in many areas, however, and these trial
                            operations almost certainly increased their food problem. These
                            operations were carried out in food deficit areas where the Viet Cong
                            have no ready alternative food sources. In such areas, notably in the
                            central plateau and mountain regions, food denial tactics are clearly in
                            order. In areas where food is plentiful, crop destruction is probably
                            not useful and may be counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Phuoc Long operation, Saigon reports that U.S.
                            advisory personnel believe the general area in which the operation was
                            carried out is a major rice producing area for Zone D. At the present
                            time, Zone D personnel are extremely short of rice; they reportedly
                            require 300 tons per month and are only getting some 150 tons per month.
                            According to information obtained from a recent <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> prisoner captured in Zone D, the authorities in Zone D
                            have instructed each man to grow enough rice to feed three people. The
                            Vietnamese Central Intelligence Organization reported last December that
                            twothirds of the Viet Cong in Zone D were to be used for crop
                            protection; this information was derived from captured <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> documents. It is the considered opinion
                            of U.S. advisory personnel that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            located in <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0265"/>Zone D are absorbed
                            almost full-time with the problem of survival. As evidence of this, our
                            advisory personnel cite the fact that the defection rate in the area is
                            increasing and that prisoners and defectors are almost invariably hungry
                            and miserable.</p>
                        <p>Future crop destruction operations now under study include about 4,000
                            acres in Binh Dinh, Thua Thien, Phnoc Thanh, and Quang Tin provinces.
                            For best results, these targets should be sprayed in April and May.</p>

                        <p>Inside Viet-Nam there is little evidence that either defoliation or crop
                            destruction has generated any significant political reaction against the

                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-controlled areas would consider it
                            unsafe and hence unwise to express adverse reactions to this program of
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>Viet Cong propaganda efforts are known to have produced popular
                            demonstrations in one provincial capital. On February 8 and 10 Viet Cong
                            were able to stage, in front of the Kien Hoa province headquarters, a
                            demonstration against artillery, air strikes, and the use of chemicals
                            to destroy their food. Since no herbicides have been used in Kien Hoa
                            province, the demonstration was purely the result of Viet Cong
                            propaganda. Saigon comments that the Kien Hoa demonstrations indicate
                            that the Viet Cong can do exploit locally the use of chemicals to at
                            least the temporary detriment of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The demonstrations in Kien Hoa appear to be unique, however, and Saigon
                            reports that they have no information suggesting that operations carried
                            out to date have had any measurably adverse effects on the local
                            population. It is perhaps significant that the only area in which Viet
                            Cong propaganda has had any apparent effect is one where the population
                            has had no first-hand experience of defoliant chemicals.</p>

                            adequate. Ground and air leaflet distribution was employed, using

                            explain the program prior to using defoliants in the area. “Sprayed

                            there are indications that it was not adequately carried out, in part

                        <p>Radio Hanoi has carried propaganda about the defoliant and crop
                            destruction programs for more than a year, billing them as chemical
                            warfare by the United States against the people of Viet-Nam. The Hanoi
                            charges include the use of poison gas as well as noxious chemicals and
                            allege the deaths of many people and animals as a result.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi output on this theme was stepped up sharply in mid-February and has
                            increased steadily since. By mid-March roughly one quarter of the total
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> output was devoted to the
                            subject. <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> propaganda recently
                            featured a protest to the International Control Commission, reported a
                            mass protest rally in Hanoi on April 7, and claimed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NFLSVN11">NFLSVN</gloss> has evidence of poison sprayings
                            including “objects, photos, and witnesses.” Moscow, Peking and Havana
                            have picked up the theme, but it still occupies a very small percentage
                            of their total output.</p>
                        <p>Non-Communist playback has been negligible to date. On April 1, the New
                            York Times printed a letter from British philosopher Bertrand Russell
                            charging that the U.S. is using chemical warfare to destroy crops and
                            livestock and starve the population. The Times editorial set the record
                            straight in the same issue, however, strongly refuting Russell’s charges
                            and pointing out that only common weed killers have been used. The
                            Cambodian press has carried a few items, and Hanoi recently cited a
                            statement by 11 African nationalist organizations condemning the U.S.
                            However, the African statement in fact contained no specific reference
                            to poison.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence to date that the Bloc propaganda campaign has tended
                            to undermine international support for our Viet-Nam policy or that it
                            has damaged the image of the United States abroad.</p>

                            persuaded the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to undertake a press
                            conference on the subject which was held March 20. The presentation was
                            very well done and followed closely an Embassy-prepared guidelines

                            probably served to place Communist charges in perspective for the
                            Western press in Saigon, and by giving them the true facts, it should
                            tend to prevent their being taken in by future Communist propaganda
                            against the program.</p>
                        <p>All U.S. posts and missions abroad have been informed of the facts of the

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">4. Conclusions</hi></p>
                        <p>The Embassy has recommended that both defoliation and crop destruction be
                            continued. They further recommend that they be given authority to
                            approve all herbicide operations, including crop destruction; that crop
                            destruction and defoliation be regarded as a single program, and that
                            the recommendations of local commanders and advisers should henceforth
                            carry more weight in the use of herbicides in order to relate herbicide
                            operations more directly to the local military situation.</p>
                        <p>Reports from the field do not permit precise, statistical evaluation of
                            the reactions of the people or the military effectiveness of these
                            programs. In part this is due to the limited scale on which herbicides
                            have so far been employed. It is also due, in larger part, to the
                            inherent difficulties of measuring popular sentiment in Viet Nam and to
                            the continuing problem of defining progress in guerrilla conflict.</p>
                        <p>Some factors are clear if not measurable. One such factor is the value of
                            food denial tactics. The Viet Cong are short of food in some areas and
                            food denial, by whatever means, increases their difficulties. If
                            herbicides are not available, other means have been and will be used by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to destroy <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops. These alternate means may be more
                            difficult, as hand destruction in remote areas, or more destructive of
                            the soil and human life, as napalm.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">R.G.K. Thompson</persName>, head of the
                            British Advisory Mission in Saigon, believes that crop destruction
                            should be used only in situations where it is clear that the Viet Cong
                            have no alternate sources of supply. It is his view that crop
                            destruction is a useful weapon only when the people and the Viet Cong
                            are effectively separated. This appears to be a correct evaluation, and
                            our use of defoliant chemicals may have been premature. However, since
                            the programs have been initiated and have proved effective against Viet
                            Cong crops in remote <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0268"/>areas, and
                            since there are distinct disadvantages to halting the program at this
                            time, we believe they should be continued on at least a limited
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>A prime consideration in this evaluation is that the Communist propaganda
                            will almost certainly be continued regardless of whether or not the
                            herbicide programs are continued. This propaganda has not so far had any
                            significant and measurable effect either inside or outside Viet-Nam.
                            There are signs, however, that the Bloc intends to redouble its efforts,
                            and it is not impossible or even unlikely that this propaganda will
                            become more effective in the future.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the degree of effectiveness of future Bloc propaganda,
                            halting herbicide operations now would tend to confirm Bloc charges and
                            invite further such campaigns because of their proven effectiveness
                            against us. (It is worth noting in this connection that the only place
                            in Viet-Nam where the Communists have succeeded in generating a
                            demonstration against herbicides is in an area where the people have had
                            no first hand experience of either defoliation or crop destruction.)</p>
                        <p>We recognize as <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1">Thompson</persName> has
                            pointed out, that feet and brains, not gimmicks, will win the war. We
                            also recognize the dangers of herbicide operations. On balance, however,
                            the following considerations appear ruling: <list>

                                    fields of fire, it would appear that hand cutting would normally
                                    be at least as easy and inexpensive as defoliation.</item>

                                    denial tactics are certain to bring effective pressures on

                                >McNamara</persName> requested a plan to reduce the American

                                >MACV</gloss> made several plans which were rejected as being too
                            expensive and finally submitted a Comprehensive Plan for <gloss

                            A-417 and in later messages (enclosed).<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Not

                            The objective was to “assure the capability of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to exercise permanent and continued
                            sovereignty over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> at the end of
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 65 without the need for continued
                            US special military assistance”. Reductions in military personnel would
                            not start until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65. The cost of the
                            Plan, which involved additional training for the Vietnamese forces so
                            that they could take over more quickly, was estimated at $168 million
                            above already planned expenditures for the period through <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68. The additional cost for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64 alone was planned at $88 million. The
                            plan also required additional expenditures by the Vietnamese of about
                            800 million piasters (the equivalent of $10.9 million at 73 to 1). This
                            would require deficit financing by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> in <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0270"/>addition to
                            the deficit financing needed to pick up the costs of the strategic
                            hamlet and counterinsurgency programs. All above figures subject to
                            change without notice.</p>
                        <p>As you know Bob Thompson suggested while in Washington that if one or two
                            provinces became genuinely “white” by July or August this year, and if
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> continued to make good progress,
                            the US should seriously consider pulling out a significant number of
                            men, say 1,000, by the end of calendar 1963.</p>
                        <p>The Comprehensive Plan described above, which has been approved by
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> as well as by the Embassy, has been
                            under study in Defense since early February. Quite clearly <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> will not be able to make the funds
                            required by this plan available.</p>
                        <p>Politically, I recommend that a substantial number of American military
                            should be pulled out of Viet-Nam by the end of this year, provided we
                            make the progress suggested by <persName corresp="#p_TBRGK1"
                                >Thompson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            discussions with the Ambassador show that this is a touchy subject with
                            the Vietnamese. However, the Vietnamese would like these men taken out
                            of the provinces. It is more likely that they will be taken out of
                            Saigon where you report that 50% of the American military are now
                            stationed. It is for our military to decide which jobs they can best
                            eliminate. I understand very confidentially that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will tell them to cut their
                            forces by 1,000 at the end of this year and will also make it clear that
                            large additional funds will not be available.</p>
                        <p>I believe the difficulty <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has faced
                            has been to try and meet <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>’s July request that the cut be completed by
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68, and secondly to assume that
                            the rate of increasing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> strength
                            through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 which had already been
                            planned should be maintained in the face of a very substantial cut in
                            our military. It would be more realistic to make a substantial cut now
                            provided progress continues, and to then plan to reduce the rate at
                            which the American military are cut back in the following years. Should
                            the war go better than we expect in ‘66 and ‘67 we can always pull out
                            still more men. This would be safer than pulling out too many men too
                            soon.</p>
                        <p>You have asked that we first seek to reach agreement with the military on
                            a ceiling and that we then ask them to cut by 1,000 at the end of the
                            year provided good progress continues. When the Comprehensive Plan was
                            made there were 12,200 U.S. military in Viet-Nam. The number is now over
                            13,000 and before your request was made State approved further increases
                            which could bring the total to 15,600. Since <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss> will have to ask State clearance for any further
                            increases and since <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            will almost certainly order them to make a cut of about 1,000 by the end
                            of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 63, the question of a ceiling has
                            become somewhat academic. It adds one more emotional element to an
                            already tight situation.</p>
                        <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>If we insist on it, and if the war should suddenly take a turn for the
                            worse, we would then have to approve a break in the ceiling and <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would have to rush in additional
                            men.</p>

                        <p>That we see what happens at Honolulu. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            is very conscious of our views and I think our relations would be less
                            strained if we do not insist on them at this time. We should veto any
                            further requests for increases which in effect would place a ceiling of
                            15,600 on our military and quietly support <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName>’s intention to achieve a significant reduction
                            by the end of the year, provided things go well. Personally, I think
                            1,000 military could be pulled out of Saigon tomorrow and things would
                            go better. During 1964 we should press for a further reduction of 1500
                            to 2000. You should also keep in mind that of the present 13,000 in
                            Viet-Nam about 3,000 are advisers and 10,000 are troops. I would not
                            want to see us cut 1,000 advisers at the end of this year, but the
                            military could well cut some of their headquarters and backup
                            troops.</p>

                        <p>I attach a memorandum prepared by the Department of State and a paper
                            prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2"
                                >Documents 96 and 93, respectively.</note> on the subject of
                            chemical defoliation and crop destruction in South Vietnam. Both papers
                            come essentially to the same conclusions and recommendations, which are
                            best summarized on page 8 of the attached State paper. If you accept
                            these recommendations, you will, in effect, be continuing present policy
                            with one important exception: both State and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> wish to give blanket authority to Saigon to decide when
                            and where crop destruction operations will be carried out. At present
                            such blanket authority has only been given for defoliation (weed killing
                            operations). Permission to destroy crops by chemical means still must
                            come from Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0272"/>
                        <p>It seems to me that, having started on this type of operation, we have
                            already reaped the propaganda whirlwind. If we stop now the propaganda
                            will probably continue, and we would be denying ourselves whatever
                            military effect the use of herbicides have. Both <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR1">Roger Hilsman</persName> and I felt, when we were
                            in South Vietnam, that under certain special conditions which will occur
                            more and more frequently as the Viet Cong are driven into more remote
                            base areas, the use of chemicals to destroy crops from the air has a
                            definite military value in denying food for the fighting cadres of the
                            Viet Cong. Under these circumstances it would seem to me unwise to
                            cancel this program at this time; but I do think you should not grant
                            blanket authorization to Saigon for crop destruction activity. It is
                            hard to conceive of a situation where there would not be time to explain
                            a project to Washington and obtain authorization from here.</p>

                        <p>By mid-April 1963 a considerable amount of tension had developed between
                            the Government of Vietnam and the U.S. Government over operations in
                            South Vietnam. Both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and

                            strikes. The results of this study are presented below.</p>

                        <p>During the past six months about 7,000 combat support sorties, or a
                            little more than 1,000 per month, have been flown in <gloss
                                target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. About 2,500 of these, or 35%, have
                            been flown by Farmgate (combined US/<gloss target="#t_VNAF1"
                                >VNAF</gloss> crews). Of these 7,000 combat support sorties, <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> has flown about 1,900 interdiction
                            missions, while Farmgate aircraft have flown about 600 such missions.
                            Thus, Farmgate has flown about 415 combat support sorties per month over
                            the past six months, of which about 100 per month have been interdiction
                            missions. Accordingly, Farmgate combat support sorties have amounted to
                            about 35% of the total such sorties flown in <gloss target="#t_SVN1"
                                >SVN</gloss> over the past six months, while Farmgate interdiction
                            sorties have counted for less than 10% of that total.</p>

                                    concentrations, headquarters, storage areas, communications and
                                    control centers, arms manufacturing facilities, etc. These
                                    targets are normally located in remote areas where the air
                                    interdiction mission is the only feasible method of destroying
                                    them.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Of these three types of targets, only the third kind is likely to be
                            inhabited at the time of an interdiction mission against it. Because of
                            the remote areas in which targets are normally located, however,
                            interdiction strikes against them are unlikely to affect many people who
                            might be classed as “innocent bystanders.” To be sure, these target
                            areas could harbor some people who were not wholehearted V(: supporters
                            or who might even be basically anti-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.
                            It is highly doubtful, though, that the numbers of such persons are
                            great enough in proportion to the total numbers of people in <gloss

                            operations to have any important effect on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>’s efforts to gain control over and support of the mass
                            of the population.</p>
                        <p>The basic source of intelligence for interdiction target selection is
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> knowledge of those areas under
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control or in which <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> influence is predominant. This knowledge
                            is gained from secret agents in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            employ at different levels; interrogation of <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> prisoners and defectors; captured <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> documents; patrolling and scouting by <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, Rangers, Special Forces and
                            paramilitary units; after-action surveillance of withdrawing <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to obtain information on escape and
                            dispersal routes; <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> ground fire; and
                            photo reconnaissance. Sometimes, intelligence gathered from one or more
                            of these sources has such a high reliability that a valid target can be
                            established immediately. When, however, intelligence is fragmentary or
                            has a lower evaluation rating, additional confirmatory evidence is
                            sought by employing one or more of the sources mentioned above, as well
                            as by photo reconnaissance flown specifically for target location and
                            evaluation. Any time lag ensuing from this process requires revalidation
                            of the target.</p>
                        <p>In many cases, the information provided by local civil <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> authorities establishes the basic
                            requirements for an interdiction mission. This information is passed by
                            civilians through the village and district chiefs to the Province Chief,
                            who passes it to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            authorities. Interdiction target requests originating with the local
                            civilian authorities must be passed at least to Corps level for
                            approval; target <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>requests
                            originating at the Corps level or higher must be passed to the local
                            authorities to confirm the validity of the target. While the mechanism
                            for approving interdiction targets varies slightly from Corps Hqs. to
                            Corps Hqs., all such targets must be approved at the Corps level.</p>
                        <p>Additional requirements for target identification and attack are
                            effective target marking, two-way radio communications, and trained
                            Vietnamese forward air controllers, all of which must without exception
                            be employed before Farmgate aircraft are authorized to attack an
                            interdiction target. Final discretion for carrying out interdiction
                            missions rests with the pilot. There are many cases on record of both
                            Farmgate and <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> pilots refraining
                            from attacking targets because of inadequate target visibility,
                            communications failure, inadequate target markings, and apparent
                            discrepancies between the target as seen by the pilot and as described
                            in the target folder. Pilots returning to base having refrained from
                            delivering ordnance for these reasons are not charged with failure to
                            carry out their missions. They are debriefed and the results of their
                            observations are fed back into intelligence channels for verification
                            and necessary correction of targets.</p>
                        <p>No one would claim that the sources of intelligence on which target
                            selection is based are faultless. Nevertheless, as described above, raw
                            intelligence is subjected to such painstaking scrutiny and confirmation
                            at all levels before a target is approved and actually attacked that the
                            risks arising from Vietnamese carelessness or insensitivity are
                            considered to be minimal. Parenthetically, the stringent requirements
                            and controls imposed on Farmgate interdiction missions have been adopted
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and greatly improved <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> operations and procedures.</p>
                        <p>It is admittedly difficult to obtain accurate and complete information on
                            the casualties caused by interdiction strikes. Nevertheless, positive
                            official evidence is available in only one case to confirm that innocent
                            people have been killed or injured in interdiction strikes. It should be
                            noted that this case was attributable to serious pilot error rather than
                            to faulty intelligence or improper target selection. Reports of other
                            such incidents are occasionally received; they are investigated but have
                            not been confirmed. There is certainly no evidence to suggest that the
                            relatively small number of Vietnamese affected by interdiction missions
                            react more adversely to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> than do
                            the many more affected by all types of <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military
                            operations. It also seems highly questionable to conclude that
                            individuals affected by Farmgate or <gloss target="#t_VNAF1"
                                >VNAF</gloss> interdiction strikes, even if these individuals are
                            basically anti-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or at least less than
                            wholehearted <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supporters, are going to
                            become sympathetic to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Just as
                            good an argument to the contrary might be made: individuals who are
                            half-hearted supporters of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or who
                            are forced by circumstances to work for the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> could regret the circumstances which exposed them to the
                            strikes, and blame <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0276"/>the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> for these circumstances; they could fear
                            those strikes more than they resent the perpetrators of the strikes.
                            Indeed, there is more evidence to support this argument than the
                            contrary one. One of the generally accepted major reasons for the
                            large-scale Montagnard flight into <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                            >GVN</gloss>-controlled areas over the past year has been their fear of
                            being caught between <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military operations, including air
                            strikes. Their reaction generally was not to go deeper into <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> territory but to flee <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-controlled areas in search of <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protection. Similarly, in a more recent
                            case, it appears that the 1,300 or more refugees of Khmer-origin who
                            recently fled an area long controlled by the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> in the Tri Ton District of An Giang Province to receive
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protection did so because the
                            area near where they had been living had just prior to their flight been
                            subjected to heavy and sustained air strikes against the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. These people who have sought <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protection have undoubtedly made no
                            conscious political choice between the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; rather they have sought
                            safety and decided that safety lay with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> rather than with the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                            >VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, less than 10% of the combat support sorties flown in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in the past six months have been
                            interdiction missions flown by Farmgate aircraft. These aircraft, of
                            course, have <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> markings. As was
                            originally stipulated in the rules of employment of Farmgate aircraft,
                            they are employed in combat support missions only when the <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> capability is exceeded. Despite
                            frequent press reports on the role of <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                >USAF</gloss> personnel in combat support missions, there is no more
                            emphasis on that role than on the role of the US Army advisers attached
                            to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> combat units. There is thus no
                            foundation for believing that US participation in interdiction missions
                            could intensify the Communist charges of US control over the war in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> or of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s “neo-colonial” subservience to the
                            US.</p>

                        <p>The analysis above is intended to place the subject of interdiction air
                            strikes in proportion within the overall context of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s war against the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>’s efforts to win the support of the population. It
                            obviously attaches more weight generally to the pro arguments in the
                            reference instruction than to the con arguments, largely because the
                            latter are reduced in importance when applied to the subject of
                            interdiction in its proper context as we see it. Nevertheless, it is
                            believed useful to make some specific comments on the Department’s pro
                            and con arguments.</p>

                        <p>Regarding the first pro argument, intelligence reports confirm that the
                            interdiction effort restricts <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            movements, the consolidation and storage of <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> arms, equipment, food and other supplies. Interdiction;
                            strikes also restrict the manufacture of <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> war goods, keep the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            forces off balance, disrupt training centers, render medical attention
                            more difficult and lower morale. In short, the destruction of
                            interdiction targets restricts the flow of war materiel to <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces, which in turn reduces their
                            capability to fight.</p>
                        <p>A key pro argument has been omitted from the reference instruction.
                            Farmgate interdiction missions constitute about one-fourth of the
                            interdiction missions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. To reduce
                            Farmgate participation in such missions before <gloss target="#t_VNAF1"
                                >VNAF</gloss> has the capability to fulfill the requirements and at
                            a time when operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are
                            being intensified in accordance with the National Campaign would deprive
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of an important military
                            advantage. Undoubtedly, the plan of ground operations under the National
                            Campaign would have to be restudied and reduced in scope, resulting in a
                            prolongation of the war. Similarly, the political impact of a Farmgate
                            curtailment at this time on US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            relations is likely to be considerable.</p>

                                    arguments 1, 2, 5 and 6 are so general that they might be
                                    applied across the board to all types of <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                        >GVN</gloss> military operations. To use them against a
                                    specific aspect such as interdiction gives those arguments much
                                    more importance than they should have in relation to the pro
                                    arguments. One might ask, for example, that if Farmgate
                                    interdiction missions were ruled out, would the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> be better able to win the

                                        >VC</gloss> be able to recruit with much less ease? In our

                                <p>In this connection, it may be a dangerous oversimplification, as

                                        >SVN</gloss> territory as enemy or any village as <gloss

                                    dangerous oversimplification to consider that there are no hard

                                    Such areas are frequently revealed by <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                                    ideal. It may also be admitted that certain Vietnamese officials
                                    are not as sensitive to the basically political nature of the

                                <p>In this connection, there appears to be a misconception as to
                                    what an interdiction target is. It is not an area, but a
                                    pinpointed facility or troop concentration. Thus, even if a
                                    province or district chief considers an area as enemy territory
                                    simply because it harbors <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, the
                                    interdiction strike is conducted, not against an area but
                                    against a specific verified target—a target which is usually in
                                    a remote area. The 230mile area referred to in the reference
                                    instruction was not the target but the target area. In that area
                                    there were 19 pinpoint targets of which 12 were hit and 7 were
                                    not hit because of weather. The incident referred to was caused
                                    by pilot error.</p>

                        <p>US-piloted interdiction missions, at the present stage of the war in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, are a necessary supplement to
                                <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>’s interdiction capability,
                            which is growing but is still insufficient to fulfill the intensified
                            requirements of the National Campaign. Total Farmgate and <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> capabilities are still at times
                            exceeded by these requirements. Intelligence <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253"
                                facs="0279"/>reports confirm that the present combined interdiction
                            effort of Farmgate and <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> is
                            restricting <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> capabilities through the
                            destruction of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> troops, arms, equipment
                            and supplies.</p>
                        <p>The continued refinement of target selection, marking and operational
                            control techniques has reduced insofar as possible the likelihood that
                            interdiction missions will cause casualties among innocent civilians or
                            among people who are not wholehearted <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            supporters, although there is no way to ensure that interdiction
                            missions will avoid such casualties altogether. There is, on the other
                            hand, considerable evidence that those threatened by air strikes and
                            other combat operations have found that the way to escape danger is to
                            seek <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> protection. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not thereby won their loyalty, but
                            it has won control over them and the opportunity to win their loyalty,
                            and it has denied them, their resources and their energies to the <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Against this, there is very little
                            concrete evidence available to give weight to the argument that
                            interdiction missions, more than other kinds of combat operation, will
                            render more difficult if not impossible the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>’s task of winning the loyalty of the people. To curtail
                            or withdraw Farmgate interdiction operations on the basis of very little
                            negative evidence when the positive evidence of their effectiveness is
                            much greater would, in my judgment, be a mistake. It would render more
                            difficult and lengthy the task of restoring internal security to <gloss

                        <p>The fundamental questions raised in the reference instruction have been
                            on our minds here for a long time. It is certainly useful to have made
                            another mission-wide assessment of this particular problem. I have
                            myself been on the look-out for many months, and have had many
                            discussions to try to evaluate the net effects of many types of military
                            operations, not alone air operations. The yardstick used is winning the
                            people. The best evidence, I think, is found in captured <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> documents and in <gloss target="#t_POW1"
                                >POW</gloss> and defector testimony. Among these, I have seen
                            nothing to indicate or suggest that the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> think that air strikes are helping to win the struggle
                            for them. On the contrary, all the evidence from <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> sources is in the opposite sense.</p>

                        <p>On paper the above goes far to meet our requirements. Only significant
                            change from past procedures is that involving U.S. provincial
                            representatives concurring in province chiefs’ expenditures. This is not
                            something we would insist on—we are not interested in vetoing
                            expenditures, quite the contrary—and procedure was initially introduced

                        <p>There is, however, no present alternative to trying to make this work. To
                            try to force use of counterpart piastres for counterinsurgency would not

                            approach.</p>
                        <p>As for using <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 US-owned piastres,
                            this seems to us nonstarter because it presupposes <gloss

                        <p>Only other alternative is further piastre purchase. We have made it very
                            clear from outset that this is ruled out, and that we would not
                            recommend it. We have also discussed fully with <persName

                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s willingness in fact to spend
                            sums which seem to be required. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> is aware that our leverage on this consists in the

                            that has to be done.</p>
                        <p>In summary, this outcome is not as fool-proof as we would like, but on

                            <item>In general, highly significant progress has been made in the
                                Strategic Hamlet-Provincial Rehabilitation program in many
                                provinces. Progress is measured in terms of the establishment, in
                                steadily increasing number, of viable hamlets with inhabitants who
                                have the will and the means to resist the Vietcong. There is a sharp
                                difference between the number of such hamlets, and the total number
                                of strategic hamlets officially listed as complete by the Vietnamese
                                Government. That the distinction is both necessary and realistic has
                                been confirmed to us by Colonel Lac and his staff who reviewed these
                                evaluations in draft.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item><p>After six months field experience with this program, it has
                                    become inescapably clear that, although the concept itself is
                                    excellent, execution of the program is seriously handicapped by
                                    a lack of understanding of the concept and the lack of
                                    sufficient will to put it into effect. This is especially true
                                    of provincial and other local participating officials, but is by
                                    no means confined to them. There is, almost across the board,
                                    great difficulty in grasping the idea that “the strategic hamlet
                                    is a state of mind.” Conditioned by years of experience with the
                                    French, and having no prior experience in the practice of
                                    democratic methods of leadership, many feel unable to carry out
                                    the program without using methods sure to alienate the
                                    population whose support is its real objective. Significant
                                    progress has been made in improving the basic attitudes of
                                    officialdom but this progress has stemmed more from our
                                    on-the-spot insistence that the welfare of the population be
                                    considered than from Central Government direction.</p>

                                    practical actions. Specific guidance from the Interministerial
                                    Committee against such practices as the collection of money for
                                    hamlet construction from the population has been honored as much
                                    in the breach as in the observance (one province chief recently
                                    received a reminder on this score and complained bitterly that
                                    this would force him to stop his entire program).</p>

                            <item>More important than what the Central Government says, however, are
                                its actions in rewarding some province chiefs and punishing others
                                for their progress in establishing hamlets. Here the stress has been
                                almost entirely on quantity, not quality, which has reinforced the
                                    <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0284"/>natural inclination of
                                most provincial officials to create strategic hamlets “by command.”
                                I have accompanied the Minister of Interior, for instance, on visits
                                to hamlets where he praised the Province Chief for having moved the
                                population without expense to the Government, but where I found out
                                later the Province Chief was obliged, because of popular discontent,
                                to use two companies of Civil Guard to keep the people in the
                                hamlets. This continues up to the present to be the main approach of
                                the Central Government. This must be changed, for insistence by the
                                Central Government on unrealistic requirements tends to force
                                province chiefs into actions surely destructive to the
                                program.</item>

                            <item>This situation is changing for the better, but still too slowly to
                                produce the type and number of viable hamlets needed to win the war.
                                Fortunately, encouraged by readily available support and by our
                                guidance and backing at the provincial level, more and more province
                                chiefs are learning for themselves that the program must be carried
                                out the hard way, i.e., by persuading the population and winning
                                their support—rather than by herding them into hamlets. It is
                                precisely this change at provincial level which is most encouraging
                                and which holds the most promise of ultimate success if we can keep
                                the present support pattern in being.</item>

                            <item>These are problems which must be understood and which must be
                                solved if the strategic hamlets are to be viable and effective in
                                achieving their purpose. The evaluations which are attached
                                highlight some of the problem areas, particularly in the Delta where
                                they are most acute and where, except in a few provinces, the
                                apparent progress is largely illusory.</item>

                            <item>In conclusion, it should be added that the above comments must not
                                be construed as reflecting undue pessimism or a negative outlook. To
                                the contrary, the strategic hamlet program has so well proven itself
                                in those areas where it has been well executed that there is every
                                reason for optimism and confidence. At the same time, however, if
                                success is to become widespread, some of the obstacles and problems
                                involved must be realistically faced and solved. These can be solved
                                if we have the perseverance and the intelligence to continue to seek
                                their solution in a manner which fits the task, for the heart of
                                this task is a psychological revolution in the way the Vietnamese
                                Government and its officials operate.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bill</hi>: I was glad to discuss with you the
                            problem of jets for Viet-Nam. Having thought it over, I believe on
                            balance that it is best not to provide the Vietnamese Air Force with
                            jets at this time. Certainly we should consider whether they should have
                            jets before our extraordinary assistance is withdrawn, but this is some
                            years off. Unless some new and important factors arise, I suggest we let
                            the matter rest for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Certainly American pilots in F-101’s can do a better job of photo
                            reconnaissance than Vietnamese pilots in T-33’s. It would not lead to a
                            significant reduction in U.S. personnel. There thus doesn’t seem to be a
                            compelling reason for changing now. As you say, we have violated the
                            Geneva Accords in the past. We have been cited for these violations.
                            However, in each case our actions resulted in an important increase in
                            Viet-Nam’s ability to defend itself (e.g. helicopters and M-113’s). The
                            reason our violations have not caused greater repercussions is because
                            we made it clear to the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> that we were
                            helping Viet-Nam defend itself. Tacit Indian recognition of this point
                            was shown by the helpful <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> report of
                            June 2, 1962,<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">For excerpts of the Special
                                Report issued in Saigon on June 2, 1962, by the International

                            charging North Viet-Nam with aggression. We are still trying to get a
                            legal report out of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> which could
                            give us more useful ammunition. Thus, we don’t want to rock the tippy
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> boat more than we have to. Jets
                            are an emotional subject with them which we should not take on without
                            compelling reasons. Herbicides in Viet-Nam and the whole situation in
                            Laos are already giving us enough to do with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1"
                                >ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Finally, so long as the jets are ours we can pull them out any time it is
                            in our interest to do so. To give them to the Vietnamese could be
                            considered an escalation. The war seems to be going our way under the
                            terms in which it is now being fought. We shouldn’t give the other side
                            a pretext to change the terms unless we thereby obtained a decided
                            advantage.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0287"/>
                        <p>In short, giving the Vietnamese jets at this time will not shorten the
                            war or materially reduce the American commitment. It would risk
                            international repercussions which we are anxious to avoid.</p>
                        <p>In saying the above, I do not mean of course to close the door on this
                            issue. I think it should be reviewed whenever the situation has so
                            changed as to warrant reconsideration.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">On

                                    personally, because I think <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"

                                    their thinking is moving away from that solution and in the

                                            ordered stepped-up aid to Viet Nam. There seems to be a

                                            give us your assessment?</p>
                                        <p>”The President: Well, we are putting in a major effort in
                                            Viet Nam. As you know, we have about 10 or 11 times as
                                            many men there as we had a year ago. We have had a
                                            number of casualties. We put in an awful lot of
                                            equipment. We are going ahead with the strategic hamlet
                                            proposal. In some phases, the military program has been
                                            quite successful. There is great difficulty, however, in
                                            fighting a guerrilla war. You need ten to one, or eleven
                                            to one, especially in terrain as difficult as South Viet

                                            don’t think it is darker than it was a year ago, and in

                            M-114’s, he stated that they had not been in use long enough to prove

                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary directed that we should

                            should put additional M-113/M-114’s in the Thai Program. we should also
                            consider these vehicles for India. In this regard, <gloss

                        <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported that
                            the M-79 grenade launcher is one of the best weapons they have in
                            Vietnam. It is useful for the troops, paramilitary forces, and for
                            hamlet defense.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated that we should

                        <p>d. In regard to the Navy, Capt. Drachnik reported that scheduled junks
                            are now all operational. The Gulf of Siam patrol has shown good results,
                            where the junks are backed up by PGM as available. He said that
                            additional PGM will be assigned to the area when they are received.
                            Capt. Drachnik stated that one item of concern is the shallow draft
                            swimmer-support boats. They have worked out well but maintenance is
                            difficult. The bow is subject to heavy damage and they have a repair
                            problem, the main trouble at present being getting sufficient epoxy
                            resin. A shipment was due on 1 April but has not yet arrived.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary directed that we look
                            into this problem and speed up delivery of the epoxy.</p>
                        <p>e. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported that
                            the medical program is going well. We presently have a team of 127 US
                            medical personnel there. They treat about 150,000 people a week. They
                            are training <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> personnel, both <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> and strategic hamlet medics. In
                            regard to the latter, there is a problem with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Department of Health which is slowing
                            up the training program.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated that he thought
                            the major purpose of the 127-man medical team was to train Vietnamese
                            and that it appears they are putting more emphasis on treatment rather
                            than training when the opposite should be true. He directed that <gloss
                                target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> develop and send in a plan
                            for medical training of Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>f. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> discussed the
                            training and equipment of the paramilitary forces. In response to a
                            question, he stated that hamlet militia do get weapons, but that the
                            issue of weapons is subject to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            regulations. The Secretary mentioned that at the previous conference the
                            subject of AR-15 rifles had arisen. He asked how many were in-country
                            and what was the appraisal of this rifle. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported that it is a very
                            good weapon and well-liked, but that the weapons in-country can do the
                            job. The Secretary remarked that possibly we should not send in any new
                            rifles unless they are AR-15’s. It was pointed out that our rifle
                            program is now about completed and that all programming is for
                            replacement or attrition, and that for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            64 substituting AR-15 for other weapons would cost about an additional
                            $1 million.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated he would review
                            the reports presently in Defense regarding the AR-15 prior to making any
                            further decisions regarding this weapon.</p>
                        <p>g. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported that
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> defection rate was increasing. The

                            instituted and looks good. However, there is a shortage of loudspeaker
                            planes to use in connection with this program. It was pointed out that
                            there is a restriction on use of US planes and crews for loudspeaker
                            operations. The <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> has enough C-47’s,
                            but needs additional loud-speaker equipment.</p>

                        <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated that we should
                            look into the restrictions on use of US planes and crews and make them
                            commonsense restrictions, that we should minimize the participation of
                            US personnel and that we should expand as rapidly as possible the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capability for loudspeaker operations.
                            He directed that <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> send in
                            a list of equipment needed to install in <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                            will see that it is delivered.</p>
                        <p>h. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> reported on
                            progress of the National Campaign Plan noting that Phase I is
                            essentially completed, and Phase II should formally start in July.
                            However, there will be no dramatic entry into Phase II, since many
                            activities are already underway with increased operations throughout
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>i. On the Strategic Hamlet Program, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1"
                                >Trueheart</persName> reported that generally speaking it is going
                            very well in the first three Corps areas, but not very well in the IV
                            Corps. He stated that in the II Corps we have an excellent plan which is
                            well co-ordinated and which is going well. In the Delta area, the
                            strategic hamlet problem is more difficult. Here the people are spread
                            out more, with hamlets one house wide and five miles long along the
                            canal. In the area there are more <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, the
                            people are generally more hostile to the Government, and strategic
                            hamlets defenses are more difficult.</p>
                        <p>j. On border problems, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> stated that as long as we have Laos and Cambodia
                            there will be border problems. In regard to infiltration, he stated that
                            Phu Quoc is a transshipping point. Where the junk patrols are backed up
                            by PGM (as in the Phu Quoc area), they are more effective.</p>
                        <p>k. In giving his outlook for the future, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> gave his opinion that some of
                            our recent setbacks had been due to people dropping their guard. He said
                            that this is a natural reaction when things are going well, and it is
                            something we have to watch. Also, this is the wrong time for us to
                            mention any cutback to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. We
                            should not have them think that now that we have gotten them this far,
                            we are going to decrease our support.</p>

                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> presented the proposed
                            '64-'69 <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> force structure and the
                            proposed phasing in of equipment to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1"
                                >RVNAF</gloss>. The Secretary questioned some of the figures, in
                            that they showed larger forces in ‘68 than in ‘64, whereas we are
                            operating on the assumption that the back of the insurgency would be
                            broken by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>'65.</p>
                        <p>(7) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated it his impression
                            that the projections were too light on helos and transport aircraft and
                            too heavy on fighters. He specifically questioned the introduction of
                            F-5A and F-5B aircraft.</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>He further stated that insofar as the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            is concerned, once the insurgency is broken, the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be about
                            $50 million per year. He suggested that it would be wise to work out two
                            alternative plans-one that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could
                            carry on with about $50-$100 million US assistance annually (including
                            supporting assistance) and the other which showed what would be required
                            from a military standpoint.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> then presented the
                            detailed ‘64 requirements, which showed a total of $163 million for
                            maintenance of current forces and $59 million for force improvements. It
                            was pointed out that the $163 million operating requirements exceeds the
                            present <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘64 Vietnam <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> ceiling of $159.1 million. A detailed
                            list of each project for force improvement was then presented.</p>
                        <p>(8) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated that he did not
                            see how it would be possible to meet the proposed total $222 million for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 64. He then proposed that the
                            figure of $65 million for ammunition be reduced to about $30 million. He
                            would guarantee that if <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> ran into
                            trouble, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would see that requirements
                            were filled immediately from US stocks. The Secretary expressed his
                            views that US equipment now in; country which is to be turned over to
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be turned over at no cost
                            to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. This would cover such items as

                        <p>(10) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary requested that in the

                        <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> stated there
                            has been an increase in photo recce over the past year. He stated that
                            over 70% of targeting for interdiction purposes comes from photo recce.
                            Currently, we have a problem of quickly getting film from the airfield

                            operations. The controls are all pointed toward hitting verified <gloss

                            personnel. General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName>
                            mentioned that in the past year there have been 1350 combat sorties.
                            During this period there have been reported only 14 alleged reports of
                            air strikes hitting friendly personnel. Of these 14, only in two cases
                            did investigation show the aircraft hitting the wrong target.</p>
                        <p>(14) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated he is satisfied
                            that we are doing well in the air interdiction effort, but that we
                            should make sure that all possible errors are reported and that we keep
                            track of any errors shown up in targeting in the air strikes.</p>

                        <p>a. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated that

                            somewhat less cordial than it was six months ago. There remains a sense

                                >GVN</gloss> concern re US advisors is not with any advisors who are
                            in the strictly military field, but rather with the group of advisors,
                            civilian and military, now in each province and concerned with advising
                            and assisting the Province Chiefs. While these advisors are the ones
                            that cause <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concern, at the same time
                            it is these advisors who are most valuable in the over-all <gloss

                        <p>(15) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary stated that we should
                            have a plan for phasing out US personnel; as the situation improves we
                            should phase down our effort. This will be required if we are to get
                            continued US support for our effort in Vietnam. The Secretary also
                            stated that the last category of personnel he would take out would be
                            advisors. He still desires that we lay down a plan to have the <gloss

                            so that we can take out 1,000 or so personnel late this year if the
                            situation allows. The Secretary repeated that we should lay down a plan
                            to expedite training to get <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> personnel
                            to take over tasks being performed by US personnel. For instance, he
                            asked why should we have US personnel flying Cessna 185’s?</p>

                            there is a projected shortage of piasters for future operations. The
                            alternatives we have for solving this piaster shortage are all
                            undesirable; these include budget deficits, US piaster purchase, and
                            relaxation of US imposed import controls. The piaster problem was
                            discussed further without reaching any recommended solution.</p>
                        <p>(16) <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>: The Secretary requested that in view

                        <p>c. There was a brief discussion of press relations. It was pointed out
                            that we have a problem either if US personnel talk too much or refuse to
                            talk to the press at all. Better indoctrination is the only way we can
                            improve this situation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Ed</hi>: I would like to suggest a steady,
                            low-key, and continuing propaganda campaign, particularly through
                            Vietnamese media, to the effect that North Viet-Nam is falling
                            increasingly under Communist Chinese influence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> poses as the father of
                            Vietnamese independence and it would be galling for him and his
                            government since the Chinese have been the ancestral enemies for more
                            than 2,000 years, having invaded Viet-Nam many times and, indeed,
                            controlled the country for about 1,000 years. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho chi Minh</persName> has always tried to
                            straddle between Russia and Communist China and to play the role of the
                            elder statesman patching up differences between the two. His posture is
                            clearly becoming increasingly uncomfortable and I thus think it would be
                            timely to turn his discomfort to our advantage.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps more importantly we do not want North Viet-Nam to become a
                            satellite of Communist China. This would be regarded widely in Southeast
                            Asia as one more inevitable step in the takeover of Asia. It would also
                            render that much more difficult any possible political solution to the
                            Vietnamese problem and reduce the viability of the Vietnamese hope that
                            some day their country may be reunited. While this hope may not seem
                            very viable to us even now, it must be a part of the long range
                            political program of any government in South Viet-Nam. We cannot, within
                            our present policy, control the balance of North Viet-Nam’s alignment
                            between Russia and Communist China, but I think we have the capability
                            of influencing it. If <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho chi Minh</persName>
                            and his government are labelled as becoming increasing subservient to
                            Communist China it is at least likely that he will increase his efforts
                            to demonstrate his continuing strong connections with the Russians.</p>
                        <p>Ho’s problems in this respect are highlighted by an Airgram from Paris
                            (A-1693, January 16, 1963)<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">Not printed. (<hi

                            the number of Russian technicians in North Viet-Nam declined from 60% to
                            15% of all technicians in North Viet-Nam during 1960 and 1961 whereas
                            the percent of <gloss target="#t_CHICOM1">ChiCom</gloss> technicians
                            allegedly increased from 28% to 80% of all technicians. Ho’s problem is

                            will need a lot of logistic support for a <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"

                            such support from Communist China his country would become “virtually a
                            vassal of neighboring China.”</p>
                        <p>I suggest such a campaign could be carried on by highlighting every visit
                            or program between North Viet-Nam and Communist China and by frequently
                            citing the innumerable instances in Vietnamese history when the Chinese
                            have sought to or have actually gained control of Viet-Nam. I believe
                            the program should not be high-keyed and short lived. It should be a
                            slow, steady repetition of the theme. We should avoid the untruth of
                            stating that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho chi Minh</persName> is the
                            satellite of the Communist Chinese, but rather suggest that he is
                            falling increasingly under their influence.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I wonder if someone on your staff could give us the
                            present status of our capacity and of the South Vietnamese capacity to
                            broadcast into North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to have your views on this question and provide any
                            further information which you might need.</p>

                                religious sect flags could be flown only on religious holidays at
                                places of worship or private homes with the permission of the local

                            encountered popular resistance to enforcement of law as thousands
                            Buddhist flags publicly displayed. At police request evening May 7
                            Province Chief Dang reportedly rescinded order. Morning May 8
                            demonstration at large Tu Dam Pagoda resulted in speech by Chief Bonze
                            in presence Buddhist Dang criticizing <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                            indications are this not true. Firing then broke out.</p>
                        <p>1100 hours May 9, Province Chief addressed estimated 800 youth,
                            demonstrators, explained crowd actions spurred by oppositionist
                            agitators had necessitated troop action to maintain order. Head Bonze
                            requested crowd disperse peacefully and turn in flags. Some of crowd
                            heard chanting “down with Catholicism”.</p>
                        <p>At moment Hue quiet. Population controls and unusual troop deployment not
                            observed. However, situation very fluid and reports of Buddhist

                                >Bell</persName> suggested that we should explore sending opinion

                            should make a recommendation as to when it would be advisable to have

                        <p>The outcome of these negotiations will not be known for quite a while.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has agreed to finance all of
                            these projects up to the total amount of 2.3 billion piasters which we
                            requested. However, these projects will be subject to <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control and in most cases will have to
                            be negotiated, project by project, with the <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss>. A slowdown and curtailment of the whole <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> effort is therefore likely.</p>
                        <p>We will have to evaluate the effect of this possible slowdown and
                            curtailment on the overall program and on the total war effort as the
                            program continues under the new ground rules. We will need to keep up a
                            steady pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to maintain
                            the necessary momentum. And if after we have given this arrangement a
                            fair trial, it appears that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            effort is inadequate, we may be compelled to make some very hard
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. The Commercial Import Program
                                    (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>)</hi></p>
                        <p>As we approach the end of the fiscal year, Saigon states that orderly
                            licensing and procurement under the Commercial Import Program will be
                            seriously disrupted if more money is not made available. Saigon
                            estimates that they need additional new obligational authority (NOA) of
                            $15 million for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 63.</p>
                        <p>The amount of aid extended under the Commercial Import Program has varied
                            from year to year. The import targets have in the past been set, for
                            psychological reasons, higher than we really expected the Vietnamese
                            importers to realize. This was done both to ensure an orderly flow of
                            commodities and to reassure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that
                            the largest possible amount of counterpart funds would be available for
                            essential war programs. This year’s import demand, however, apparently
                            exceeds our estimates.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. Economic Considerations</hi></p>
                        <p>The economic justification for an increase in new obligational authority
                            for the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> is questionable. It would
                            probably be possible for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            maintain the present level of imports by drawing down its own foreign
                            exchange reserves, which are quite substantial. It may also be—although
                            this is not at all clear—that inventories in Viet-Nam are now so large
                            that a curtailment of commercial import licensing would not seriously
                            affect the situation. Imports could perhaps be halted, and the resulting
                            cut in counterpart piaster resources made up by deficit spending,
                            without any disastrous economic results.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0308"/>
                        <p>It is also possible that an increase in <gloss target="#t_CIP1"
                                >CIP</gloss> funds would result in a rise in <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> foreign exchange reserves or in an increase in luxury
                            imports. It appears, moreover, that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> may be deliberately pumping up present import demand.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has pursued an easy credit
                            policy, and last month business borrowing reached an all-time high. Much
                            of this borrowed money is apparently being used to purchase <gloss
                                target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> goods.</p>
                        <p>Finally, general U.S. policy toward <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>’s
                            worldwide is that they must be based on balance of payments
                            considerations rather than serving as budgetary support. We should
                            recognize that this requested increase leans toward the budgetary
                            support approach.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">B. Political Considerations</hi></p>
                        <p>The political justification for an increase is as strong as the economic
                            justification is weak. In the vital area of piaster resources for the
                            war effort, it is clear that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            willingness and ability to finance the <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>
                            programs depends to a large degree on counterpart piasters generated by
                            the commercial import program. For us to disrupt licensing under the
                            commercial import program at this time would make it doubly difficult,
                            if not impossible, for us to persuade the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> to carry out those <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>
                            economic and social projects which we deem so essential in winning the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The war is entering a critical stage. Economic programs have been
                            launched which support the military effort and which we believe are
                            essential to any permanent restoration of security. To keep up this
                            momentum we must have <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> confidence and
                            cooperation, and we must retain maximum influence in the direction of
                            the war effort.</p>
                        <p>The funds involved are not large by comparison with our total effort, but
                            failure to provide them might well reopen the whole “crisis of
                            confidence” problem so recently skirted.</p>

                                at Vichy, France on August 6, 1950. It established regulations
                                governing the creation and functioning of associations in Vietnam.
                                As interpreted by the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                government, the law governed the functioning of the Buddhist

                                associations. The law provided, however, that “a special status
                                shall be prescribed later for Catholic and Protestant missions and
                                for Chinese congregations”. (For text, see Journal officiel de la

                            seems quiet, but long term hard feelings will clearly persist. Pacifist
                            direction of Buddhist leadership has avoided additional bloodshed and

                        <p>For many thousands of years the Buddhist clergy and faithful throughout
                            the world as well as within the country have been loyal to the
                            principles of benevolence, altruism and honesty espoused by Buddha.
                            Because of this, Buddhism has gradually evolved an atmosphere of
                            tranquillity. History has clearly proven this point. Thus, for many
                            years Buddhists have been terrorized and repressed everywhere. Because
                            of our conscience, we are still resigned, although not cowardly so, in
                            the face of the suffering and mourning of our present national
                            circumstances. But our sorrow has been taken advantage of by the
                            authorities to cause untold mourning among the Buddhist clergy and
                            faithful in the country. Buddhism has been condemned in a manner unjust
                            to a religion which has existed in the country for thousands of years.
                            From these actions we can perceive the bad intention of the authorities.
                            They even have smashed the most sacred symbol of the Buddhists by taking
                            down the International Buddhist flag. This decision is contrary to the
                            Constitution and brazenly violates the freedom of religious worship. In
                            the face of these unjust actions, the monks and faithful throughout our
                            country must rise up and struggle for their ideals.</p>
                        <p>The incident which occurred three days ago really affected morale. Blood
                            flowed and human lives were once again sacrificed, so we are now
                            determined to place our hopes before the government and to request the
                            following points: <list>

                        <p>The points mentioned above express the most ardent hopes of Buddhist
                            bonzes and followers in the entire country. We are prepared to make
                            sacrifices until such time as the reasonable aspirations mentioned above
                            are realized.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">On May 13 a representative of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government met in
                                Hue with a delegation of Buddhist leaders to consider the demands
                                outlined in the May 10 declaration. The government official
                                suggested that most of the Buddhist concerns were groundless, but
                                indicated that the government would consider them. He added,
                                however, that the Buddhist declaration was extreme in language and
                                appeared to be an ultimatum. Such an approach, he indicated, was a
                                mistake. A memorandum of the discussion between an unnamed
                                Vietnamese Government official and the Buddhist delegation was
                                transmitted as enclosure 1 to airgram A-20 from Hue. On May 15 a
                                delegation of Buddhist leaders took up the Buddhist demands with

                            regarding the funding of counterinsurgency activities and to our

                        <p>As I understand the position, during the calendar year 1963 the
                            Government of Viet-Nam is prepared to supplement the U.S.-owned and
                            counterpart piastre contributions with its own funds up to a limit of
                            2.3 billion piastres, to carry forward the mutually agreed projects
                            described in broad terms in the attachment to my letter to you of March
                            18, 1963.<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3"><ref target="#d61">Document
                                    61</ref>.</note> (As of January 1, 1963 it was predicted that
                            the U.S. owned and counterpart piastres would amount to <gloss
                                target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $900,000,000, which would leave a
                            remainder of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $1,4000,000,000 to be
                            provided by the Government of Viet-Nam.) I understand that the
                            Government of Viet-Nam is not prepared, however, to have its own funds
                            administered under the procedures followed for the “purchased piastres”.
                            Your government nevertheless wishes to maintain the functions of and the
                            existing relationship between the Vietnamese Interministerial Committee
                            for Strategic Hamlets and the U.S. Committee on Province Rehabilitation.
                            It is also the desire of your government that the activities of the
                            Vietnamese authorities in the rural areas continue to be coordinated
                            with those of the American agencies.</p>
                        <p>To give effect to these principles, it is my understanding that your
                            government proposes that funds to be administered by the provinces
                            (generally funds for those projects enumerated in Section A1 of the
                            attachment to my letter of March 18) shall continue to be paid into a
                            central account at the Treasury, as required, and disbursed from this
                            account directly to the province chief as needed to carry out approved
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>It is also my understanding that these provincial programs will, as in
                            the past, be reviewed and approved by the Interministerial Committee and
                            by the Committee on Province Rehabilitation. At the province <pb n="290"
                                xml:id="pg_290" facs="0316"/>level, however, the power to disburse
                            Government of Viet-Nam funds within the approved programs will rest with
                            the province chief. In view of the U.S. contributions to these programs,
                            the province chief shall nevertheless consult with the U.S.
                            representatives concerning his plans and proposed actions so that
                            related U.S. and Vietnamese programs can be properly developed and
                            executed. The province chief and the U.S. advisors will keep each other
                            informed of all aspects of their respective activities in the execution
                            of the approved programs.</p>
                        <p>With regard to those programs administered by national agencies
                            (generally those projects enumerated in Sections A2, B, C, and D of the
                            attachment to my letter of March 18) no special fund will be involved.
                            The funds will in general be administered in accordance with customary
                            procedures for the use of counterpart funds, i.e., on the basis of
                            appropriate understandings between the Director General of Budget and
                            Foreign Aid and the U.S. Operations Mission.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is my understanding that your government undertakes, as in
                            the past, to provide piastre support for necessary operations of the
                            U.S. Operations Mission. It is estimated that such support will amount
                            to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $173,000,000 during 1963.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the undertaking of your government with respect to funding
                            of counterinsurgency activities and the procedures described above will
                            provide a reasonable basis for carrying forward the strategic hamlet
                            program, a program which has already contributed so much to the security
                            and well-being of the rural population and which holds out the promise
                            of final liquidation of the Communist insurgency and of revitalization
                            of rural society in Viet-Nam. I should be obliged if you would confirm
                            that this letter correctly states the position of your government.<note

                            interdiction of air strikes against the Viet Cong. The issue resolves to
                            whether or not the United States and Vietnamese military are effectively
                            carrying out our policy of treating the war in South Vietnam as
                            essentially a political battle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> also asked about the effect
                            of the bombing campaign on the loyalty of the people of South Vietnam.
                            The major expressed “considerable skepticism” about the findings of a
                            recent study which indicated that the use of air power in Vietnam was
                            under tight control.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: As you well know, for over
                            a year the Government of the United States has been backing an
                            intensified program for aid and assistance to the Government of the
                            Republic of Vietnam. You are conversant with our many and varied
                            programs, particularly those in the military, economic, social, and
                            psychological fields. Last week Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> and I, with selected personnel from our staffs,
                            met in Hawaii with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> and representatives of other Washington offices
                            to review the status of these U.S. programs. In my short conversations
                            with you during the past few days, I have mentioned certain aspects of
                            this meeting and the various U.S. programs. However, I think it timely
                            to present for your consideration a review of the progress made in
                            certain areas to date, therefore this letter. In this review I will
                            confine my remarks only to the military programs.</p>
                        <p>Our combined, intensified effort really began in late 1961 and early 1962
                            and has continued to the present, at which time I can report practically
                            all military programs have been completed or are well on the way to
                            completion.</p>
                        <p>What has been accomplished? The results are indicated below:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Intelligence:</hi> A significant effort to improve the
                            intelligence advisory capabilities was initiated in January 1962. The
                            new U.S. Intelligence advisors were all in place by May 1962. These
                            advisors working side-by-side with their Vietnamese counterparts have
                            made a commendable improvement in reporting and editing intelligence
                            data. The improvement has been apparent in the success of the Vietnamese
                                <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0323"/>actions in the field. On
                            the U.S. side, and because of the one-year assignment of most personnel,
                            practically all of the original advisors now have been replaced. The new
                            group have been hand-picked, given special schooling in both
                            intelligence matters and language training and, all-in-all, should
                            further improve our joint intelligence efforts.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Communications:</hi> A year ago a reliable military
                            communications system did not exist. Since September 1962, there has
                            been a tremendous improvement in communications throughout the country
                            and within the tactical units of the Vietnamese Armed Forces. The
                            tropospheric scatter system, recently completed in the northern part of
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, is now being extended into the
                            Delta region. All divisions and major units are now connected by
                            telephone switchboards and other improvements are being made daily.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mobility:</hi> There are now seven U.S. Army helicopter
                            companies and one U.S. Marine helicopter squadron in the country to
                            provide troop transport and escort capability for <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. These units plus the two <gloss
                                target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> squadrons provide a formidable mobile
                            force for rapid reaction against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>With improved intelligence, widespread and rapid communications, and a
                            constantly available mobile force, actions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> have improved tremendously and
                            should improve even more in the future. While I believe that these are
                            the primary improvements, much more has been accomplished.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">New Divisions:</hi> The Ninth and Twenty-Fifth
                            Divisions have been added to the “Front Line” combat troops in the past
                            year. Both have given outstanding accounts of themselves in recent
                            actions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Paratroops:</hi> The training of the Parachute Brigade
                            has been completed and the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> now has
                            six battalions, all combat tested and proven in battle. They are very
                            fine soldiers and create a fine impression wherever they go.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Marines:</hi> The four Marine battalions, like the
                            paratroopers, are outstanding soldiers. They, too, have been combat
                            tested and also give an outstanding performance when they confront the
                            enemy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Rangers:</hi> 86 Ranger Companies have been processed
                            through the training schools. Many have seen combat and are used in
                            small-scale operations constantly. I think greater and more effective
                            use should be gained from them in the future.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Civil Guards:</hi> As you know, last year over 375
                            Civil Guard companies were trained. The Civil Guard Program continues to
                            increase in strength, and this year’s program calls for training and
                            equipping new companies while retraining some of the old companies where
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Self-Defense Corps:</hi> Last year over 1,700 SDC
                            platoons were trained in some 35 camps. Like the Civil Guard, the
                            Self-Defense Corps is being increased, equipped, trained, and retrained
                            in 1963. I <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0324"/>am sure you know as
                            well as I that the Civil Guard and the Self-Defense Corps share a
                            tremendous burden in the complex war against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Civilian Irregular Defense Groups:</hi> U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> Special Forces have trained
                            approximately 40,000 members of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group.
                            These are the mountain scouts, the commandos, the strike force, and the
                            village militias. The program continues and becomes even more important
                            as <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> control moves into those areas
                            where the Viet Cong have controlled the population for many years in the
                            past,</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">M-113’s:</hi> One-hundred forty-seven of the M-113
                            Armored Personnel Carriers are now used extensively in combat. These
                            have proven invaluable and have operated faithfully under extremely
                            difficult conditions in the war against the Viet Cong. I think these
                            vehicles will be used to greater advantage as the unit commanders and
                            soldiers gain experience in the use and capabilities of these very fine
                            fighting machines.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">M-114:</hi> This is a new armored vehicle, not yet
                            fully tested in combat. However, the four companies organized with the
                            95 vehicles now in the country are trained and should be in action
                            before the end of this month.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Caribou, C-123’s, Otters:</hi> There is one Caribou
                            company in the country partially serving the most remote of the outlying
                            bases, and also two C-123 squadrons which carry the brunt of the load in
                            the air transportation of men and supplies. There is also one Otter
                            company, a small passenger vehicle with limited military cargo
                            capability, operating in the corps and division forward areas. The
                            performance of these aircraft has been outstanding.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Air Force:</hi> The sortie rate for the Air Force rose
                            from 150 sorties a month in January 1962, to over 1,500 in April 1963.
                            The pilots are becoming more experienced, and many of the night
                            operations are now performed by the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1"
                                >VNAF</gloss>. The Air Force is being dispersed in small tactical
                            units throughout the country so that their reaction time will be even
                            more rapid than it is today. This should greatly increase the damage it
                            can do to the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Navy:</hi> The Junk Fleet of 644 junks now has 28
                            divisions patrolling the coast. The Sea Force has taken over patrol
                            along the 17th Parallel and in the Gulf of Siam, while the River Force
                            is supporting operations in the Delta area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Strategic Hamlet Program:</hi> As you are aware, there
                            are over 6,000 strategic hamlets now completed in the country, with
                            practically 8,000,000 people securely tucked away behind their fences. I
                            believe this program, more than any other, has served to isolate the
                            Viet Cong from the people. As it nears its completion in the coming
                            months, it should prove one of the turning points in the war. Many of
                            the combat <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0325"/>units are involved
                            in “clearing and holding” operations in support of the strategic
                            hamlets. While I think this is vital, I believe that at the same time we
                            must continue to have other operations which search and clear the Viet
                            Cong bases that can be located.</p>
                        <p>With all of these accomplishments, the major prospective courses should
                            be to: organize, train, and develop the new units-re-organize, refine,
                            and retrain the old units. Besides continuing to carry the war to the
                            enemy, training in all branches of the service and all its various
                            aspects continues to be one of the most vital features of any future
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> operations continue to
                            increase and improve in scope and effectiveness; however, there are
                            still areas for refinement. I feel many military plans are too
                            grandiose, employing too many large units. Although these are necessary
                            in some instances such as the operation in the Do Xa area, I think they
                            should be the exception. A review of the records will show that the
                            smaller operations, of battalion-size or less, contributed more than 70%
                            in the Viet Cong casualties. Small unit actions must be continually
                            stressed. I am also concerned that too often once contact with the enemy
                            has been established it is lost too quickly, the enemy fades away, and
                            the operation is called to a halt. Nothing will hurt the Viet Cong more
                            than relentless pursuit. The units must stay out longer, and once
                            contact is gained, continue to retain it until the Viet Cong are
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Although I have said the intelligence has improved, there is still room
                            for further improvement. Too many operations are still based on faulty
                            or incomplete intelligence and end with no real contact being
                            established—as though we were fighting ghosts.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong are still with us, but for the most part are not so
                            bothersome. His logistics support (principally food and medicine) has
                            been severely disrupted by the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            operations, and his own operations have been cut in half. However, he is
                            still a wily enemy and apparently is dedicated to his cause because he
                            continues to put up a very stiff fight under pressure. As the <gloss
                                target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> presses him harder, I am sure we
                            will continue to find him an even more stubborn enemy because he is
                            gradually getting to be like a rat caught in a trap with no place to go
                            and being constantly annoyed. He is becoming a “foreign legion” in a
                            foreign country without support from the local population.</p>
                        <p>All in all, the past year has been one of remarkable effort and
                            remarkable progress. All the programs listed above have been carried to
                            a successful conclusion on the one hand while fighting the war continues
                            on the other. Few people realize this, but to me it makes the
                            accomplishment of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam even more
                            impressive. The Army, Air Force, and Navy of the Republic of <pb n="300"
                                xml:id="pg_300" facs="0326"/>Vietnam have come into their own by
                            carrying the fight to the enemy. Daily they gain more and more
                            confidence, and many units have won their spurs. We might call 1962 the
                            year of the “building the base”. I am confident that 1963 shall be
                            called the year of victory. From the military point of view I know that
                            this can be true if we continue to maintain constant pressure on the
                            enemy, even more so than we have in the past six months. The equipment
                            is on hand, the units are trained, the morale is high, and from all I
                            can ascertain, the determination and the will are present.</p>
                        <p>Though I note your brother, Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, in a recent interview with the press<note n="2"

                            I disagree. The <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is ready-over
                            two-thirds of the people are in strategic hamlets. I say the time for an
                            all-out offensive is at hand, before the armed forces get stale.</p>
                        <p>I will close by saying that at the staff conference last week in Hawaii,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reiterated
                            the U.S. policy of support for your country, and that we would leave no
                            stone unturned to achieve victory in Vietnam. My staff and I, and
                            further, all of the U.S. advisory and support agencies in Vietnam are
                            ready and willing to do their part in continuing the pressure against
                            the Viet Cong to see that victory is within our grasp in 1963.</p>

                            very much on my mind. I hope you will understand that since I returned
                            to Washington we have been overwhelmed by preparations for our
                            Congressional Presentations. There were two this week. On Monday I was
                            before the Senate Appropriations Committee on our personnel/management
                            and I have just returned today from our hearings before the House

                            members of the Committee difficult questions to ask concerning our
                            policies in Vietnam. What I am about to say to you is not influenced by
                            this experience of today nor by the news statements.</p>
                        <p>At the Honolulu Conference I talked with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>, with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL1">Joe Brent</persName>, and also raised, on the
                            floor of the conference, the problems of our counter-insurgency
                            operations under the changed financing plan. I asked General <hi
                                rend="italic">Harkins</hi> in the general meeting whether he had
                            heard from his <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> sector advisors
                            that the change in financing would impede the programs establishing the
                            strategic hamlets and the movement of supplies to them. He said he had
                            not heard from them and did not know whether there would be great
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL1">Brent</persName> agreed that the system had to be
                            changed and that a compromise method of operation, using the Government
                            of Vietnam funds in the manner acceptable to the Government of Vietnam,
                            would have to be tried. When I said on the floor of the conference <pb
                                n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0328"/>that our Assistant Director had
                            reported he expected difficulties in operation and any change in the
                            methods that had been followed would be an impediment to the program,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he did
                            not think that we could very well insist on perpetuating a system where
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had such strong objections.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not,
                            however, appear to have been briefed on this subject. Because <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had not prepared their position and
                            thereby there is only the Ambassador’s and Brent’s views here that a
                            compromise method should be tried, it would not be good for you to visit
                            Washington now.</p>
                        <p>I discussed this at some length with Dave Bell. He and I agreed that your
                            views had to be heard and respected as you are the man on the spot
                            charged with the responsibility of that which is central to our whole
                            program in Vietnam. We agreed, however, that because the Ambassador
                            feels that even if we purchased plasters with dollars the Vietnamese
                            might not permit us to use them as we had in the past, we had no
                            alternative but to attempt to make the alternate system work. On the
                            other hand, both Dave Bell and I feel if it does not work, if the goods
                            are delayed in delivery, if there are impediments to the program that
                            the question should be promptly reopened.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that you will find that <persName corresp="#p_BJL1">Joe
                                Brent</persName>, the Ambassador and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> will all feel this way. We
                            urge you to take this attitude and not to prejudge the alternate system.
                            If it does not work, if there is a documented case of delays,
                            inefficiencies and waste, I assure you that you will have plenty of
                            support in changing the system.</p>
                        <p>The question of your resigning and other members of your staff resigning
                            would not achieve, at this time, a change in policy and will damage not
                            advance our hamlet program in Vietnam. The problem cannot be dealt with
                            that way. We cannot afford to lose your services; we have no replacement
                            for you and will not look for one. I have not met anyone whom I would
                            trust to have the same understanding, the same energy and the same
                            passion for this program. The achievements of the strategic hamlet and
                            your achievements are at the core of the aid program in Vietnam, and it
                            is not a program which can spare you nor, in my opinion, is it one you
                            can walk away from. Our assignment is to finish this program. We suggest
                            that you do this: operate in such a way as to respect to the greatest
                            degrees possible the Vietnamese sensitivities about not losing control
                            of their government to us and yet we must not sacrifice a critical
                            amount of efficiency. All the materials we supply are still in our
                            hands, the food, fertilizer, barbed wire and guns we still control. Only
                            the plaster fund control has changed. If you find impediments to the
                            flow of materials to the strategic hamlets, because of the Vietnamese
                            management of funds, these should be documented not just by you but
                            jointly with the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> sector advisors.
                            It will greatly simplify our programs if we represent what we find in
                            this area as a joint <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/<gloss

                                and quite possibly, more outrageous public statements.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>If pressure is brought on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, it should serve our
                            major objective—defending Viet-Nam. Thus, if we cut or threaten to cut
                            aid, it should be in support of an objective such as full plaster
                            support of <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> projects and a continuing
                            American voice in administering them.</p>
                        <p>In the immediate instance, we could use such actions or threats to back
                            up a demand for a public <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statement
                            to the effect that American assistance and personnel were requested by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and are needed, at the present
                            level, until the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat is further
                            reduced. If such a statement is judged essential to maintaining domestic
                            support for our Viet-Nam program, the actions would be justified. But we
                            should recognize that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> might
                            well refuse to yield and could even use our demand against us publicly.
                            We should also recognize that such a statement, coming on the heels of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> remarks, would lend
                            support to the main Communist propaganda line, i.e. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is an American puppet.</p>
                        <p>Most important, if we use punitive actions or the threat of such actions,
                            we have to recognize that the mutual confidence on which the joint war
                            effort must rest will be further eroded. This means the likelihood of an
                            all-out confrontation, now or later, is increased measurably. And of
                            course, there is a very real chance that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> will not bend, and that once started down the road
                            we will be unable to stop short of anything except a change in
                            government. We don’t want to blunder into that.</p>

                            provinces, mainly to areas recently brought under Government control
                            through clear and hold operations, road and canal building, strategic
                            and combat hamlet establishment, and related measures. On trips last
                            Sunday and Tuesday<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">May 12 and May 14.</note>
                            in seven provinces, it was the consensus of all of us, including several
                            other foreign ambassadors, that important improvements were
                            unmistakable. First was the evident enthusiasm among peasants and
                            officials alike in progress to date towards permanent security and
                            follow-up benefits to the people. In one recently cleared area the
                            farmers, expressing their thoughts freely, had only one request-that a
                            hundred families living to the West of their zone be also “liberated”
                            promptly. Second was the evident goodwill and cooperation existing
                            between U.S. advisors, both military and civil, and their <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> opposite numbers. (I talked personally
                            with more than a dozen on both sides and I found no indications of
                            friction or frustration-on the contrary, the prevailing mood was one of
                            encouragement in accomplishments, goodwill, and confidence in the
                            future.) Third was the obvious purpose of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to show Americans, as well as
                            other foreigners and Vietnamese, his appreciation of American help,
                            including advisors, and his satisfaction with results achieved to date.
                            Fourth, and perhaps most striking, was <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s touch with the people. He spent two long hot
                            dusty days talking with, and seeking the reactions of farmers and their
                            families and elders to the measures <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307"
                                facs="0333"/>the Government is taking, probing their sentiments and
                            listening to their ideas. The rapport between him and the people was
                            evident and the exchange of questions and answers remarkably free. This
                            applied as well to groups of recent <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            “ralliers” and their families, who were grouped among other village
                            people, and to groups of Buddhist bonzes. Realizing that these trips did
                            not cover the entire country and cannot by their very nature be
                            completely revealing, I was nevertheless again impressed, as I believe
                            my colleagues were, by the vast difference between what is actually
                            happening in this country and the reflection of it in the outside world.
                            In my view, what is actually happening is a vindication of American and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy, a steady forcing of the
                            Communists to the defensive and a breaking of their classical pattern of
                            subversion. There is a fierce concentration on the internal problems
                            here and a consequent neglect of, or insufficient attention to, the
                            factors forming international opinion, which are way beyond the grasp or
                            control of this Government. It goes without saying that, even on
                            internal matters, there continue to be “snafus”, but the general average
                            of internal performance is improving constantly, I am convinced.</p>

                        <p>On May 17, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> issued a

                            counterinsurgency funding. The text of the communique reads: <quote

                                <p>“The Government of Vietnam and the American Embassy announced on
                                    May 17 that agreement has been reached regarding funding for
                                    counter-insurgency and other economic development projects,
                                    particularly those supporting the Strategic Hamlet Program,
                                    during 1963. The agreement provides inter alia for the
                                    continuation of counter-insurgency projects supported under the
                                    piastre-purchase agreement announced in August, 1962. As
                                    explained at that time, the latter was an extraordinary
                                    arrangement necessitated by the fact that full provision for the
                                    counter-insurgency operations in question was not made either in
                                    the Vietnamese budget for 1962 or in the United States <gloss
                                        target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Program. It was planned that
                                    the continuation of these operations would be budgeted and
                                    programmed in a manner calculated to be responsive to the
                                    requirements of the present situation.</p>
                                <p>“Under the agreement just announced, the Government of Vietnam
                                    has undertaken to supplement U.S.-owned funds and counterpart,
                                    so as to make available up to $2.3 billion piastres during

                                    United States is also providing some $55 million in the form of
                                    agricultural products, barbed wire, weapons for hamlet militia,
                                    cement, fertilizer and other commodities for the program.</p>
                                <p>“Counter-insurgency projects will continue to be initiated and
                                    developed by the Vietnamese authorities, and all of them will be
                                    fully coordinated between the Vietnamese and American central
                                    committees, as in the past. The execution of projects will also
                                    continue to be closely coordinated between the Vietnamese
                                    authorities and American experts in the provinces.</p>
                                <p>“During the course of the discussions, it was also reaffirmed
                                    that the scale of the U.S. advisory and support effort in
                                    Vietnam is directly related to security requirements and to the
                                    need to bring about throughout the country the economic and
                                    social improvements envisaged in the strategic hamlet program.
                                    Although at this time the present level of the advisory and
                                    support effort is still necessary, as the security situation
                                    improves and as the strategic hamlet programme progresses, it is
                                    expected that the need for foreign assistance, both in terms of
                                    material and personnel, will be progressively lightened.”

                        <p>Buddhists indicated to Presse they had not yet decided what further
                            action they should take in light meeting with President. Other reported
                            Buddhist actions taken include widespread circulation of protest
                            literature, including bulletins to newspapers (which have not of course
                            published this material) and hunger strikes which started in Hue about
                            May 12 and were perhaps intended secure release of arrested
                            demonstrators. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> also reports that Cao

                            with Buddhists. Under consideration in Buddhist circles are such steps

                            oppression to present International Buddhist Association, dissemination

                            of mourning for victims of Hue violence, as well as more active measures
                            such as mass meetings and demonstrations. According to Lt. Col. Thuong,
                            National Police Chief for Central <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            Plains, a Buddhist plan exists to hold parades and demonstrations in
                            every city and town in central <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> on May
                            21. Such public gatherings would of course contain danger of possible

                            police plan to attempt confine demonstrations to various pagoda grounds.
                            Also recurrent rumors that Buddhist demonstration in Saigon planned for
                            May 19 (now postponed to May 21, according to Minister of Interior).</p>
                        <p>Within Buddhist ranks it appears that religious leaders are tending to
                            counsel moderation based on religious traditions of non-violence
                            (consistent chief bonze Quang Tri’s actions in controlling followers in
                            Hue). On other hand certain lay leaders reportedly urging more activist
                            line involving demonstrations etc. Also appears quite possible that
                            individuals without genuine religious convictions may attempt exploit

                            to placate Buddhist sentiment. Initial <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> reaction was to blame incident on <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> agitation. This line has been adhered to
                            perhaps for reasons of face, perhaps because of fear that <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> acceptance of responsibility for deaths
                            would have even more damaging repercussions, or perhaps because <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wished avoid publicity to extent
                            possible. However, since allegation is widely disbelieved main result
                            has been to damage <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> credibility and
                            to further irritate Buddhists. Vietnam Presse account of Buddhist press
                            conference suggests Buddhists themselves uncertain regarding their
                            future course of action.</p>
                        <p>May 15 interview with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> may now indicate some willingness accommodate
                            Buddhists. In discussion with Ambassador May 16 Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was contemplating issuing public
                            declaration, an idea which Ambassador encouraged. Ambassador has also
                            spoken to leading Catholic leaders (Papal Delegate and Rector University
                            at Hue) urging a public statement. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> also said meeting with Buddhists went well but
                            that President could not agree to demand that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> accept responsibility for incident. There are other
                            indications <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> trying to find ways to
                            appease sentiment: reportedly Dang (concurrently Chief of Thua Thien
                            Province and Mayor of Hue) to be fixed with responsibility for Hue riot
                            and replaced along with other officials (although culprit in popular
                            mind is Deputy Province Chief Sy). However, it not clear that if taken,
                            these measures will placate Buddhists at this late date. Some high-level
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials take view <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should have acknowledged fault

                            violence.</p>
                        <p>At same time, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has acted hesitantly,
                            apparently also unsure how to proceed. Buddhist meeting with <persName

                        <p>What appears needed at this point is a prompt clear-cut statement by

                            by prominent Buddhist, and I plan to suggest this to him. While it
                            obviously would have been better if some such action had been taken
                            immediately following events in Hue, a forthright statement now would go
                            far to redress the situation. Even given this, events of past week will
                            leave substantial scar tissue among members of Buddhist faith. Without

                            first principle press relations Viet-Nam must continue be to provide

                            complete picture complicated Viet-Nam situation and US role. US public
                            must have accurate story our Viet-Nam program if we are to justify our
                            large human and material investment there. Assistance to press thus
                            commands very high priority.</p>

                        <p>We also have in mind more frequent pre-operations briefings. While
                            considerations of military security must naturally come first, believe
                            it might be possible to do more such briefings without endangering war
                            effort.</p>

                            grenades thrown by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or other dissidents

                        <p>With regard to <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName>’s
                                suggestion,<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">In telegram 1117 to Saigon,
                                the Department of State also noted that, during his current visit to
                                Washington, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName>
                                had expressed the idea that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> government should appoint a cabinet level
                                official responsible for religious affairs. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> suggested that Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> might take up
                                the idea with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</note>
                            there might be merit in creation of Cabinet-level post for religious
                            affairs. I do not feel, however, that this is propitious moment to
                            propose it, and I frankly think that at any time, proposal would have
                            far better chance of acceptance if made by Vietnamese rather than
                            American. We will work toward this at suitable opportunity.</p>

                                the Situation in Viet-Nam</hi></p>
                        <p>Colonel Serong, Head of the Australian Training Mission to South
                            Viet-Nam, stated that he believes we are winning the war in VietNam,
                            current statistical indicators reflect favorable trends, and the most
                            significant development is the increase in volume of spontaneous
                            intelligence provided by the people. This is because the Government is
                            now providing them with security from the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that there are problems with the press in Viet-Nam but
                            they are reporting what they see or are being told. He believes this
                            situation can be improved by working more closely with them in the
                            field. Our U.S. military advisors are reflecting in their comments to
                            the press their frustrations to get the Vietnamese to accept their
                            advice. The big success story in Viet-Nam is the strategic hamlet
                            program and this story has not yet been fully told. He stated that out
                            of a total population in Viet-Nam of about 16 million some 8 million
                            have been moved into the strategic hamlets, resulting in one of the
                            biggest population moves in history.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Serong presented an oral and graphic description of the concept
                            of the strategic hamlet program in the southern portion of Viet-Nam,
                            stating that its objective is to establish strategic hamlets on a radial
                            basis along communications routes with subsequent development of hamlets
                            laterally to fill the gaps. The purpose is to separate the people from
                            the insurgents.</p>
                        <p>The radial development of the hamlets is progressing well but the lateral
                            program is falling behind. He observed that we may be overextending
                            ourselves in the strategic hamlet program leaving a number of Viet Cong
                            behind enabling them to penetrate areas already cleared. The strength of
                            Vietnamese armed forces is being sapped to counter the threats of the
                            Viet Cong in these pockets of resistance. He believes <pb n="316"
                                xml:id="pg_316" facs="0342"/>that unless we clear out these Viet
                            Cong pockets we may provide the Viet Cong with an opportunity to
                            concentrate against the over-extended Vietnamese armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Serong commented that the concept for the strategic hamlet
                            program in the high plateau area envisions groups of mutually supporting
                            areas cleared of the Viet Cong. The strategic hamlets in this area are
                            designed to restrict and inhibit Viet Cong movement while those in the
                            south are designed to destroy the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Serong stated that he had discussed this problem with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> recognizes the threat of the left-behind pockets of
                            Viet Cong but he desires to extend the presence of his Government into
                            outlying areas. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> believes
                            that to pursue this program effectively he may require additional
                            resources from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, in discussing
                            this matter with Colonel Serong, stated that he believed the Vietnamese
                            units deployed to counter these left-behind Viet Cong are effectively
                            utilized as they have been able to flush out and destroy the Viet
                            Cong.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Serong concluded by stating that our goal should be to get a
                            higher percentage of the population into areas free from Viet Cong
                            attack, concentrate on economic programs in this area, and then extend
                            these “white areas” throughout the country.</p>

                                    intervention; that any U.S. interference runs a serious risk of
                                    branding a successor government as U.S. dominated. The U.S. role
                                    should, if possible, be limited to indicating discreetly, but
                                    clearly the conditions under which the U.S. would recognize and
                                    support a new government. Should further steps be required to
                                    prevent, for example, a dangerous interregnum, they must be
                                    exercised with sound knowledge, great firmness, good timing and
                                    the awareness that there will probably be only one chance to
                                    intervene effectively.</item>

                                in the event of a government crisis.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy should keep current in the Ambassador’s office a

                                likely to play important roles in a change in government. In
                                addition to relevant information on each person, it should attempt
                                to keep current his relations with and attitudes towards <persName

                                by party are usually not permanent and are not worth listing.</p>
                            <p>Responsible persons in all agencies in Viet-Nam should be discreetly
                                encouraged to submit such biographic information and evaluations of

                                leading questions on the grounds that this is routine and important
                                in all embassies. Many persons might find that they could spare an
                                hour a month to write down informally their impressions of a
                                Vietnamese friend. Officials should be encouraged to submit reports
                                at the end of their tours. The powerful role of Vietnamese wives
                                should not be ignored. It should be emphasized that information for
                                these reports should not be obtained by asking too many leading
                                questions likely to arouse suspicion.</p>

                            <p>The question of whether, how and by whom contacts should be

                                deserves regular review. Questions to be considered would include:
                                How much contact is necessary to provide essential intelligence in a
                                crisis and mutual understanding after a new government is formed?
                                How can such contacts be maintained without jeopardizing the person
                                contacted; overtly, covertly or indirectly? As a minimum the Embassy
                                Political Section should overtly maintain enough contacts so that it
                                will be known that we exercise the right to see persons outside the
                                circle of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> anointed.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy may wish to consider whether additional personnel are
                                needed to collate this material and whether some background research
                                can be done in Washington. Old reports should be reread to fill out
                                the biographic sketches to be kept in the Ambassador’s office
                                (referred to at the beginning of this section).</p>
                            <p>On the basis of the findings thus collected this memorandum should be
                                reviewed, revised and pouched to Washington for State Department
                                clearance annually.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy may also wish to consider drafting an unclassified order
                                which could be held in readiness for distribution to all official
                                American personnel in the event of a government crisis. Such an
                                order could emphasize the importance of avoiding any commitment
                                which might possibly be construed as involving American prestige or
                                support and recall that the Ambassador is the only person authorized
                                to set forth American policy.</p>
                            <p>Consideration might also be given to setting forth procedures so that
                                key American personnel could confidentially and quickly forward
                                useful intelligence to their superiors in Saigon.</p>

                            <p>The Embassy may wish to decide on what symptoms should be
                                particularly watched as most likely to indicate trouble for the
                                Vietnamese body politic, e.g.: an abnormal increase in reliable coup
                                rumors, particularly if they involve a rapprochement of leaders and
                                forces opposed to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; multiple
                                    <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> victories or serious economic
                                stagnation.</p>
                            <p>When such symptoms multiply, the question of how a change might occur
                                should be watched almost continuously. With knowledge, care and
                                luck, the U.S. might then be able to exert discreet and timely
                                pressure in order to avoid violence and chaos. For example, if the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> felt itself threatened, it
                                might be persuaded to undertake reforms necessary to forestall a
                                crisis. Likewise U.S. military and civilian advisers outside Saigon
                                might be instructed to use all their influence to persuade Corps

                                and damping down local unrest. Extra efforts should be made to

                                Viet-Nam.. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would have
                                very little popular support and if the military felt well enough
                                organized to oppose Nhu’s political machine, they would probably do
                                so. The Ambassador would have to decide quickly whether to stand
                                aside while <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> makes his bid
                                or whether to try and persuade Vice President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> to carry on as constitutional
                                successor and to persuade the military, possibly through <persName

                                    corresp="#p_DVMG1">Duong Van Minh</persName>, to support him.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> is not inspiring and
                                has for some time been reluctant to play an active political role.
                                However, he is one of the few Vietnamese politicians who can obtain
                                sympathetic popular support, particularly in the important Delta
                                area where he comes from. He is experienced. Both he and General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> would have the
                                advantage of having not been closely associated with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Tho, as <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s constitutional successor,
                                would be in the position to retain the services of most of the top
                                men now in the government. He might also broaden the Cabinet by
                                bringing in a few carefully picked new men. General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> is respected by some of the
                                more competent generals. He or another general might be able to
                                persuade them to support <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                                for the sake of constitutional continuity and in order to avoid
                                upheavals favorable to the Communists. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> and his wife would be a threat to such moves
                                unless the Vietnamese military acted promptly to remove them from
                                the scene. In the interests of public order in Central Viet-Nam, it
                                might be well if <persName>Ngo</persName> dinh Can would remain at
                                least temporarily in charge at Hue. Since the U.S. within the next
                                few years may well have to face the question of whether or not to
                                support <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> as a successor to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, it is important to
                                evaluate whether <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName>
                                political apparatus would, in the event of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s death, hold together out of
                                self-interest and support <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                                in a push for power. While <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> is unpopular, he has built up an apparatus of

                                loyalties are mercurial. The Embassy should continue to explore the
                                question of whether <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName>
                                machine would hold together in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                            <p>(This would present the same situation as described above, except

                                died a martyr to Communist violence. Thus it would be somewhat
                                easier for the Communists to play a role. Conversely <persName

                                suited to carry on the crusade of his martyred brother. There would
                                be less polarization and a somewhat greater danger of slack and
                                drift into interregnum. The chances for a constitutional succession
                                by the Vice President would be slightly increased, particularly if
                                quietly and firmly supported by the U.S.)</p>

                            <p>If the opposition were tightly organized and ruthlessly determined,

                                Certainly the failure of the attempted coup of November, 1960 showed
                                prospective coup leaders the importance of determination.</p>
                            <p>However, based on past performance it is more likely that even if

                                    >Diem</persName>, there would be dissension and confusion. The

                                instructions from Washington. Here, too, it would be particularly
                                important that the best possible dossier of biographic information
                                be available to the Ambassador (Section III supra).</p>

                            <p>This would be analogous to the situation which existed during the

                                days. It would be very dangerous particularly if it dragged on and
                                it became well known that neither <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> nor anyone else were effectively running the
                                country. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would hang on
                                as long as possible and would bitterly resent any U.S. moves which
                                might be interpreted as favoring a successor. The U.S. would have to
                                support him fully for a reasonable time if there appeared to be a
                                reasonable chance that he could reestablish himself. If the

                            <p>The main contenders would be dynastic (the President’s family) and
                                military (the best trained and organized group in Viet-Nam). A
                                constitutional successor (Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1"
                                    >Tho</persName> or an elected candidate) could only succeed with
                                military support.</p>
                            <p>Minor contenders would be opposition politicians outside Viet-Nam
                                (who have little support in Viet-Nam) and the shadowy and
                                disorganized oppositionists who still exist in Viet-Nam.</p>
                            <p>Given the strength of the Communist threat to South Viet-Nam, it
                                would be in the U.S. interest to support a government of persons who
                                were quickly available (i.e., in Viet-Nam) and who were sufficiently
                                experienced in the operation of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                    >GVN</gloss> to carry on without faltering dangerously (this
                                would probably rule out oppositionists in Viet-Nam).</p>
                            <p>The dangers of a change of government in an underdeveloped country at
                                war are tremendous. However, these dangers are somewhat mitigated by
                                the fact that Vietnamese in positions of responsibility are
                                committed to opposing the Communist takeover of Viet-Nam. This would
                                be a unifying force.</p>
                            <p>Two other factors may be serving to gradually reduce the dangers: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The war in Viet-Nam is building a group of competent men
                                        (some ministers, generals and province chiefs) who are not
                                        afraid of responsibility.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>Vietnamese leaders understand and agree on the general
                                        program which their country should follow in fighting the

                            <p>Given these factors the most realistic choice would probably be

                            <p>A dynastic succession to power by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                    >Nhu</persName> would be very unpopular in the United States and
                                in third countries (it would be wise to assume that our support of
                                Viet-Nam would be drastically weakened). Yet <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> could only be removed by use of

                                would almost certainly become known to the grave detriment of our
                                relations with any succeeding government. We would probably be wise
                                to reserve our public position until it became clear whether
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> political machine
                                was strong enough to put him in power despite his unpopularity. If
                                he succeeded, we would have to recognize his government as
                                exercising effective sovereignty. In the United States we would have
                                to emphasize the continued importance of supporting the Vietnamese
                                people in their struggle and seek to minimize any official comments
                                for or against <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. This
                                would be the most serious situation which could follow <persName

                                        <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was most
                                    forthcoming in his observations and assessment of situation
                                    here, with particular emphasis on role of U.S. advisors. He
                                    appreciates and regrets problems caused by recent published
                                    interview. In long discussion, I found nothing inconsistent with
                                    U.S. objectives in what he had to say. This was, in brief, that
                                    South Viet-Nam must continually strive for self-sufficiency in
                                    all fields if it is to endure as free nation. It cannot be
                                    expected that foreign assistance will continue in present
                                    dimensions for prolonged period, and it is up to Vietnamese
                                    people to make this unnecessary. While much remains to be done,
                                    a great deal has been accomplished under difficult
                                    circumstances, thanks in large part to American material
                                    assistance and advice. Said he hoped I realized that he is
                                    neither anti-American nor xenophobic. Said he realized that he
                                    is unpopular among many Vietnamese, because he is trying to get
                                        <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to promote a genuine
                                    revolution among the people and this annoyed the stand-patters.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> gave many
                                    examples of what he called his “lectures” to Vietnamese
                                    officials, high and low, civilian and military.</p>
                                <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0351"/>
                                <p>These lectures, he insisted, were not aimed against American
                                    assistance or advice. On contrary, he said they were aimed at
                                    making Viet-Nam self-sufficient as rapidly as possible so as to
                                    ease the burden on her friends. Citing examples, he said when
                                        <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> general recently
                                    complained about too much U.S. advice, he asked him how often he
                                    had visited <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> training
                                    centers. When told never, he said that Generals <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and Timmes are in the
                                    field every week visiting training centers and other
                                    installations and when Vietnamese officers can do the same there
                                    will no longer be the need for American officers to fill the
                                    gaps. In another instance, he said he asked <gloss
                                        target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalion commander how many
                                    times he had been visited by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1"
                                        >ARVN</gloss> general during operations. When told never,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked about U.S.
                                    general officers and commander said latter had visited battalion
                                    several times during operations. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                        >Nhu</persName> said he then told <gloss target="#t_ARVN1"
                                        >ARVN</gloss> general present that when Vietnamese generals
                                    could do the same they would be in better position to talk about
                                    no need for U.S. assistance. Talking about U.S. civil advisors,
                                    he said he had found their reports and advice to be direct,
                                    well-motivated and generally correct. On this score, he had one
                                    request to make, i.e., that our people be diagnosticians rather
                                    than physicians, meaning that they should size up a difficulty
                                    and report it to higher authority in Saigon rather than trying
                                    to fix it by end-running the Province Chief, which caused
                                    difficulties. He was explicit in promising prompt investigations
                                    through Ministerial Committee to remedy insofar as possible such
                                    situations. He agreed time not yet ripe for lessening U.S.
                                    advisor-support role, but said he would continue to work toward
                                    that end as desirable for both countries. Said he deplored being
                                    misunderstood, but had gotten used to it. I said that his views
                                    as expressed to me were entirely consistent with U.S. views and
                                    objectives, and I was reassured to have them. At same time, I
                                    hoped he would not ignore serious problems created for us by
                                    reports, such as the recent one, which was 180 degrees different
                                    from what he had just told me.</p>

                                    is, however, capable of reacting emotionally and I dare say he
                                    did so when confronted by <persName corresp="#p_UW1"

                            <item>Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>. In an
                                hour’s discussion with Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1"
                                    >Tho</persName>, I found him more bullish on situation here than
                                I had ever seen him. This was tempered by worry about handling of
                                Buddhist situation, by developments in Laos, and by present poor
                                prospects of developing any regional ties. But he thought things
                                were going well internally in struggle against <gloss
                                    target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, emphasizing particularly economic
                                improvements especially in rural area. He was most outspoken in
                                appreciation of U.S. support. As regards regionalism, I asked him
                                whether he was interested in the Mekong River development plans, <pb
                                    n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0352"/>remarked that this seemed
                                to me offer long range prospects of collaboration among <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries. He said he was
                                interested in this planning, and felt that best way to make progress
                                was to continue technical studies and planning, leaving political
                                aspects aside until more propitious time. With regard to U.S.
                                advisors, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said that it is
                                true that the presence of U.S. advisors, especially civilian, in
                                remote country areas caused the Vietnamese people to wonder who was
                                running the government. While he entirely agreed that the benefits
                                of U.S. advice should be continued until victory is assured, he
                                suggested as a device an inspection system from several central
                                locations rather than having Americans living constantly and
                                conspicuously in small rural villages.</item>

                            <item>Foreign Minister Maul. In a briefer courtesy call, we discussed
                                mainly the need to work more effectively on improvement of the image
                                of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to the outside world.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> said what struck him
                                as most ironic was the picture of President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as aloof from the people when
                                in fact his main strength lies in the liking and respect of the
                                peasantry. He said he (<persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName>)
                                had many friends among the intellectuals in Saigon, but since most
                                of these had been in one way or another deprived of some of their
                                privileges and possessions by the government in its attempt to
                                benefit the people, he thought they would be the very last to be won
                                over. On the public image topic, I suggested two things: that the
                                staff of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Embassy in
                                Washington be beefed up by several young officers who could help
                                tell the story of Viet-Nam to American groups (he said he thought
                                this was a good idea and would see what he could do about it);
                                second, that resident U.S. and other foreign journalists be taken by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on some of his
                                trips to the provinces, so that they could see and report on his
                                touch with the people. <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName>
                                said he agreed and would do what he could, but added that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had “disappointments” in
                                trying to do this in the past.</item>

                            remarked that they were “improving” and business was being conducted
                            almost normally, albeit with some ambiguity. He remarked that he had
                            attended the Laotian National Day and offered a toast to the King as
                            usual. I asked about the invitation to the Laotian King to visit Saigon.
                            He repeated that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> preferred
                            to have this next year in view of the situation here, but was willing to
                            have the visit this year if the King preferred, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> representative in Vientiane had been so
                            instructed. He said he was waiting to hear the King’s preference before

                        <p>On Cambodia, he said he saw no prospect of improvement so long as

                        <p>Re Thailand, <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> remarked that,
                            despite the fact that Thailand had sent back to North Viet-Nam about
                            10,000 to 15,000 Vietnamese residents of Thailand. the number of those
                            still remained about the <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0353"/>same,
                            38,000. This he attributed to the fact that they were sent back to
                            Thailand as a fifth column after indoctrination in North Viet-Nam. He
                            went on to say that personally he would expect the pressure of Communist
                            subversion to be stepped up in Thailand when, as he anticipated, the

                            and General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>, Chief of the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated that he wished to
                            recount to us an intelligence report which he had just received, to
                            reach a joint evaluation of the report, and to consider together what
                            should be done about it. The report concerned a meeting held on May 19
                                (<persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>’s birthday) at
                            the Mimot plantation in Cambodia, at which all the principal <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> political and military leaders in South
                            Viet-Nam had been present, as well as representatives from Hanoi.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> informant had been one
                            of the participants. (This is not the first time that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has claimed to be in touch with a
                            top <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> leader. So far as I know, previous
                            information from this or these informants has not turned out to be
                            particularly significant. Richardson confirms this impression and
                            suggests that <persName>Bill Colby</persName> may be able to provide
                            further comment. In this case, at any rate, we have no confirmation
                            whatsoever.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that at this meeting the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> leaders had been informed that the
                            Communists had now assigned top priority to liquidating the Laotian
                            problem. South Viet-Nam would for the time being have secondary
                            priority. In accordance with this decision, a directive was issued at
                            the meeting, with effect from May 20, that all <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> “special forces” in South Viet-Nam should be withdrawn
                            to southern Laos. (Neither we nor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> had ever heard of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            “special forces”. He explained that, according to his informant, these
                            were elite units, <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0354"/>about six
                            battalions in all, divided between the southern and central areas of
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, a sort of hard hard-core
                            authorized to operate throughout South Viet-Nam without prior permission
                            from higher authority. The ordinary <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            regular units had to get permission to operate outside of their assigned
                            area.) In addition, it had been directed that the <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> regular units in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            should retire into their “maquis” (or Cambodia) and cease operations,
                            dispersing if necessary to avoid contact with <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> forces. In short, the effect of the alleged directive
                            would be to leave all the fighting in <gloss target="#t_SVN1"
                                >SVN</gloss> to the regional or territorial <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                >VC</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that the report, if true,
                            indicated that it might be advisable to advance the date of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> general offensive (national campaign),
                            to sweep up the regional <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, and to
                            attempt to prevent the “special forces” from re-entering Viet-Nam. This
                            conclusion was applauded by all present, with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> in the lead.</p>
                        <p>The above is the guts of the report, but there were a number of
                            intriguing details. For example, the head of the “special forces” is a
                            General de Division by the name of Nghe who has a special flag, green
                            with a golden eagle. Nghe will accompany his troops to southern Laos
                            where he will be military adviser to a General de Brigade (<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>) named Tran Son, who is in overall command of
                            an international force in southern Laos. (Tran Son’s standard is white
                            with a gold star. He is not fully trusted by Hanoi and Nghe, a 200%
                            communist, is supposed to keep him in line.) The international force led
                            by Tran Son consists of contingents from North (two regiments) and South
                            Viet-Nam, plus Cambodia, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, and Laos. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> informant said the Cambodian
                            contingent was of battalion strength, but he was unsure about the size
                            of the other non-Vietnamese groups. At any rate, they were or are
                            supposed to be in southern Laos right now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was asked a number of
                            questions about the report—among them why the <gloss target="#t_DRV1"
                                >DRV</gloss> would pull six battalions out of South Viet-Nam and
                            expose their territorial troops when presumably it would be far easier
                            to supply an equivalent, or larger, number of elite forces from North
                            Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> agreed that this
                            was a good question and said he could only speculate that the Communists
                            might feel that international repercussions in the event of a Communist
                            takeover of Laos would be less if, for example, prisoners of war said
                            they came from South Viet-Nam rather than North Viet-Nam. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, incidentally, said he was
                            convinced that the Communists were on the point of a drive to take over
                            Laos in toto. He repeated this several times. He also said that the
                            Hanoi representatives at the aforementioned meeting had estimated that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planned to inject a force—25,000
                            men—into southern Laos.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know what to make of all this. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> never said that he accepted the report and
                            frequently used such expressions as “if it is true”. On the other hand,
                            he obviously gave it some credence. (None <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329"
                                facs="0355"/>of us here do, and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> suggested at the meeting that the report could
                            be a Communist ruse.) I am inclined to think, however, that the real
                            object of the meeting was to convey to us, particularly to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> readiness to see the National
                            Campaign Plan go forward and even to advance the kick-off date. About a
                            week ago, General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> sent
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> a longish
                                letter<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2"><ref target="#d123">Document

                            confidence that the time had come to intensify operations further. He
                            also mentioned, having in mind the <persName corresp="#p_UW1"

                                    Halberstam</persName> began with the statement: “President

                                observers believe conflicts with the one espoused by American
                                officials.”</note> that he understood that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> thought the time was not right and
                            that he, <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName>, disagreed.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was somewhat
                            perturbed by the latter remark and, undoubtedly, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> heard of it. If my conjecture is
                            right, yesterday’s meeting was <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> Oriental way of setting the record straight.</p>
                        <p>As for the conclusions of the group in <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> office, they were that, whether or not the report
                            is true, the correct course of action is to continue to intensify
                            operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. It was also
                            concluded, at <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> suggestion,
                            that there should be no special publicity to the effect that some new
                            and grandiose campaign had been started. Finally, there was some
                            discussion of the possibility of verifying the report, and Richardson
                            suggested in this connection that it would be helpful if President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would authorize deeper
                            cross-border intelligence operations, proposals for which are now before
                            him.</p>
                        <p>One other point is worth mentioning. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that he regarded our meeting as sort of a test
                            case. He had not previously informed the President (or anyone else) of
                            this intelligence report. The normal practice would have been to tell
                            the President and seek his instructions as to what to do. In this case,
                            we were consulting together first with a view to making recommendations
                            to the President at the same time the information was conveyed to him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that if-the
                            procedure worked well in this case, he thought it would be well to
                            continue it. This seems to be a healthy sign, and we will encourage
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to continue this scheme.
                            We have the impression that another object of the meeting, in <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> mind, was to show his willingness
                            to work with us.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked that we not
                            report this matter, at least until he had a chance to inform the
                            President. Hence the classification of this letter. General <persName

                        <p>In assessing general situation it quite clear that feeling continues run
                            deep among Buddhists. Equally clear that problem facing <gloss

                            freedom and discrimination. These issues-though real enough-are now also
                            being used as label and facade behind which other groups seek express
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government
                            and exploit situation for various aims. This greatly complicates problem

                            must act on assumption they are dealing with political opposition.
                            Problem is further compounded by fact that Buddhists have no recognized
                            hierarchy with which government can deal and which can take position on
                            behalf of movement. (Thus <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>

                        <p>Given history of events it seems unlikely to us that <gloss

                                >GVN</gloss> communique which clearly reaffirmed religious freedom

                                >GVN</gloss> assessment of situation and sounding him out on future
                            plans. I will also raise again possibility of President’s naming
                            commission to study Buddhist grievances. At this point, I believe it
                            would be best—from standpoint <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            acceptance as well as effectiveness with Buddhists—if commission’s
                            mandate were quite broad and not linked specifically to Hue incident.
                            What is needed, I think, is to get all aspects of problem off the
                            streets and into the conference hall.</p>
                        <p>I also prefer if possible to work through <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> on this one, rather than <persName

                            during Ambassador’s and my conversation with him May 18, and I sense
                            this is a subject on which he is predisposed not to take U.S. advice.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, on other hand,
                            claims to be completely objective and asserts he is neither Catholic nor
                            Buddhist. but Confucianist.</p>
                        <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>As for Papal Nuncio, both Ambassador and I have previously sought his
                            good offices. He was not responsive but I will try again at first
                            opportunity. Ambassador also spoke with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s confessor, who promised to do what he could.
                            Difficulty with this approach is that, as explained above, we are no
                            longer dealing with purely religious issue.</p>

                                >Thuan</persName> this morning re Buddhist problem. His assessment
                            of situation is generally same as reftel. He says <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is convinced NFLSV and <gloss
                                target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are exploiting situation. President’s
                            position is therefore very difficult. If he now makes concessions under
                            pressure, it could simply whet appetites. Next demands, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> felt, could be of a sort
                            designed to interfere with war effort, for example, a plea in name of
                            peace that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> treat with NFLSV.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is fully
                            aware of dangers of inaction. Problem is to find a solution acceptable
                            to President and to Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> pointed out again that lack of Buddhist hierarchy
                            and authoritative spokesman compounded problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he did not know
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s latest thinking but
                            expected see him later today. I suggested possibility of high level
                            commission, along lines reftel, and said that Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> might be good person to head it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was rather skeptical;
                            he did not understand why a commission was any more likely to come up
                            with a solution than the government. I said the idea was not so much to
                            come up with an immediate solution as to establish a respectable forum
                            in which Buddhists, whatever their standing, and others could be heard.
                            Once tempers had cooled, the “solution” might be relatively simple.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> remained
                            non-committal but I imagine that he will at least mention the idea to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. With regard to
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> informed me that shortly <pb

                            President had been asked by <persName corresp="#p_NTH1">Ngo Trong

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s immediate problem was whether
                            to receive delegation of four Buddhist leaders from Hue. While he did
                            not know what decision would be, he thought tentatively that it might be
                            a good idea for <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to offer to
                            meet again with Buddhists if latter would first agree among themselves
                            as to who would be empowered to speak for them. I said Buddhists might
                            have some difficulty in meeting this condition, but I saw no harm in
                            trying. President’s expression of willingness to continue talking would,
                            in any case, be good move.</p>
                        <p>I was mildly encouraged by this conversation, primarily because of
                            indication that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not apparently

                            promised let me know results his talk with President.</p>

                                special privileges and favoritism toward Catholics, stemming from
                                French rule, have been perpetuated by the <persName

                                majority of South Vietnam’s population of 14 million is nominally
                                Buddhist, even though only a small proportion have been considered

                                congregations under Buddhist clergy. There has been no formal
                                suppression of religious freedom in South Vietnam, but the
                                government has successfully curbed the political influence of some

                                demanded that the government acknowledge responsibility for the

                                3, midnight, the Embassy reported that Hue was effectively under

                        <p>Due very serious situation in Hue and grave implications for future,
                            appears here that immediate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> action
                            required. We would recommend that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            make quick conciliatory announcement, in Hue, of willingness discuss
                            Buddhist grievances. Ideally announcement should be from <persName

                            to Hue himself to talk with Buddhist leaders. At same time troops should
                            be withdrawn and replaced with police or gendarmerie. Seems most
                            unlikely that chief bonzes are in fact <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            and we even more doubtful Quyen (who well known here) could be <gloss

                        <p>Feeling here is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must be made to

                            plans for dealing with Hue situation, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> said that he could tell me in strict confidence
                            that at Cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon presided over by Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> it had been decided
                            to recommend to President that government reestablish direct contact
                            with Buddhists. President had approved and arrangements were being made
                            for Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to meet with
                            Buddhist leaders from Hue. He repeated that this decision was still
                            highly confidential but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wanted
                            Washington to know of it.</p>
                        <p>I said that I was glad to hear that contact would be reestablished, as
                            this was obviously essential to any solution. It seemed to us equally
                            essential, however, that population in Hue know of what government was
                            doing and that in our view more dramatic action was called for.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> urged me to put
                            forward any suggestions—indeed his attitude throughout was most
                            receptive, and worried—and I said that it seemed to us situation called
                            for prompt and public announcement by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> of his readiness to discuss
                            Buddhist grievances further and that effectiveness such move would be
                            greatly heightened if President himself would go to Hue for these
                            discussions and to assess situation generally. I said that I was aware
                            of risks in this course. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concession
                            in replacing principal officials in Hue June 1 apparently had no effect
                            unless it was to stimulate further agitation. Nevertheless it seemed to
                            me risk had to be taken. I told <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> that I was diffident about making specific
                            suggestions about handling of internal Vietnamese problems. Nevertheless
                            U.S. was involved in this matter and I felt bound to tell him that in my
                            opinion, U.S. support for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not
                            be maintained in face of bloody repressive action at Hue.</p>
                        <p>I said that problem was made vastly more difficult by reports of use of
                            blister gas yesterday. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            seemed incredulous. (Believe this was first he had heard of this; I even
                            had to explain what a blister is.) I said I was by no means sure what
                            sort of agent was used but that evidence was compelling that something
                            other than tear gas had been employed in last incident about 1800.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HJJ1">Helble</persName> had himself observed
                            blistering on victims and fact that some appeared be having respiratory
                            difficulties. These were symptoms which could be associated with mustard
                            gas. I added that it was probably well known in Hue that 60odd people
                            had been hospitalized last night and that press reports could be
                            expected at any time. It was therefore vital, I thought, for <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to investigate matter immediately. If
                            there were any suggestion of poisonous agent being used, <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should at once disclaim responsibility
                                <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0377"/>and proceed to punish
                            individuals who were responsible. I made it quite clear that unless
                            effective measures of this sort were taken, U.S. would probably be
                            forced to condemn action publicly.</p>
                        <p>In course of discussion, I pointed out that one of the unfortunate, and
                            explosive, aspects of Hue situation was open hostility of population
                            toward troops. I asked whether it would not be possible to remove them
                            and leave security controls to police. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> said that it was his understanding that police in

                            is and has been under serious consideration for some time. As you know,
                            my people have been talking with representatives of the Working
                            Group/Viet-Nam about this project for several months. In January there
                            was an exchange of memoranda between <persName>Bill Jorden</persName>
                            and Burnett Anderson, our Deputy Assistant Director (Policy and Plans)
                            on this subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">A January 22 memorandum

                        <p>I agree that the best way to handle this would be “by highlighting every
                            visit or program between North Viet-Nam and Communist China and by
                            frequently citing the innumerable instances in Vietnamese history when
                            the Chinese have sought to or have actuallyr gained control of
                            Viet-Nam.” We believe, however, that this will be a difficult thing to
                            handle and should, if attempted, remain under constant and careful
                            review. It should be done principally through editorial selection and
                            emphasis in news output. As Burnett Anderson stated in his memo to
                                <persName>Bill Jorden</persName> of January 25,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d152fn4">Not found.</note> the best way for <gloss
                                target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> to plug this line aside from
                            appropriate handling of spot news would be to prepare and place in some
                            South Vietnamese publication an article or series of articles on the
                            background of Sino-Vietnamese relations-articles which could be picked
                            up and replayed by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> with proper
                            attribution to Vietnamese sources. It must be recognized that the only
                            way <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> can reach audiences in North
                            Viet-Nam is by radio, and we must constantly keep in mind that anything
                            which <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts in the Vietnamese
                            language can be heard by listeners in both North and South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Our <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Vietnamese specialists have
                            pointed out that there are possible pitfalls in such an operation. In
                            emphasizing that <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Vietnamese
                            broadcasts are heard in both North and South, they point out that
                            emphasis on <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>-Chicom partnership may
                            only serve to increase the dimensions of the threat that looms from the
                            North. Since <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0381"/>one of our
                            propaganda objectives in South Viet-Nam has been to dispel the illusion
                            that the Viet Cong are “ten feet tall,” unless very carefully handled
                            the addition of the Chinese factor into the equation in propaganda
                            output might prove counter-productive. Even the traditional ethnic
                            enmity between the two races and the Vietnamese fear of the Chinese may
                            be overshadowed by the elements of sheer power and geographic
                            propinquity involved.</p>
                        <p>It should perhaps be further pointed out that with over one million
                            Chinese residents in South Viet-Nam who will also hear these
                            broadcasts,- we must exercise caution in emphasizing any traditional
                            enmity between the two races per se, but rather concentrate on the
                            present Chinese Communist regime.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> also raises the question: Even if we
                            succeed in tarring <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>
                            with the brush of Chicom satellitism, can we persuade the people of
                            North Viet-Nam that they have any realistic alternative to coming to
                            terms with the Chicoms while they still have a chance? After all, they
                            say, Communist China is doing pretty well in its contest with the
                            Soviets, and its victory over India proved that it’s also doing pretty
                            well with its “adventurist” foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>In setting forth the foregoing caveats, I do not mean to imply that the
                            project should not be undertaken; I only wish to emphasize that it is a
                            difficult and delicate undertaking which must be carefully planned and
                            constantly reviewed.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of information policy, we can begin immediately, in <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> news output, to lay a heavier emphasis
                            upon all evidences of DRV-Chicom collaboration and less emphasis upon
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>-Soviet contacts. Further
                            projects, such as placement of materials in Vietnamese publications and
                            subsequent replay on the Vietnamese service of <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> naturally take considerably longer.</p>
                        <p>If you agree that even despite the aforementioned possible pitfalls, we
                            should begin using <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> for this purpose,
                            please let me know.<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn5">An undated copy of a

                            passing out tracts and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would cease
                            radio and press propaganda, e.g., “spontaneous” declarations of support
                            for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from obscure Buddhist groups in
                            provinces. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that

                            today, as his “delegation of powers expired today”. Although <persName

                            that negotiations took place in framework of Buddhist ultimatum of some
                            sort. Substance of agreement as described by <persName

                                    disclaims responsibility for this law which was promulgated
                                    under Bao Dai and suggests that Buddhists “through normal
                                    channels” ask National Assembly to amend it. Under questioning,

                                    some reports, Law No. 10 is grievance to which Buddhist
                                    leadership attaches most importance. New law would presumably
                                    put Buddhists on absolutely equal footing with Catholics in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> was vague about just how
                            agreement would be implemented. In particular, it was not clear whether
                            it would be a behind the-scenes or a publicly announced agreement. (On

                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> did say that
                            agreement would have to be put before Vice President’s new commission

                            formal acceptance by President. Commission, incidentally, did not in
                            fact meet yesterday, owing to fact that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> (and <persName corresp="#p_LUONG1"
                                >Luong</persName>) fully occupied in backstage negotiations with

                                >Thuan</persName> said that he had no doubt about <persName

                            Buddhists in center and he was sure that anything acceptable to

                            his previous complaint about lack of Buddhist hierarchy.</p>
                        <p>Since reported agreement is not very different from what <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has probably been prepared to accept
                            all along, I am inclined to think that <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> may not have fully disclosed <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concessions. For example, I had to draw
                            out of him the fact that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> undertook
                            to support change in law by National Assembly. I would not be surprised
                            if there were other hidden features, such as government undertaking to
                            wink at more extensive use of Buddhist flags than indicated above or to
                            punish or remove specific officials guilty of abuses.</p>
                        <p>I am keeping my fingers crossed on all of this but meanwhile request that
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>’s confidence be

                            Affairs and Attorney General, New Zealand by Prime Minister Keith

                            would be of great political value as demonstrating multilateral support

                                >Diem</persName> had requested liaison pilots. Prime Minister
                            Holyoake offered to provide such assistance, with the understanding that
                            the New Zealand pilots would have a liaison but not a combat role in
                            Vietnam. (Telegram 470 from Wellington, June 6; Department of State,

                            special bank account and put money in it, and has issued Presidential
                            decree defining procedures for use of these funds which accords with our
                            understanding. What is more, in the provinces our Rural Affairs Advisers
                            report that coordination with Vietnamese counterparts and readiness to
                            accept and even seek US advice is greater than ever it was when we were
                            signing the checks. This is no doubt too good to last, but I am
                            certainly not keen to do anything which would rock the boat—as this
                            would almost certainly do.</p>
                        <p>As for Staley-Thuc agreement, position is well understood in Washington.
                            Suffice it to say that, in light of that report, Vietnamese consider
                            that, at minimum, we have no right use against them rises in foreign
                            exchange reserves below $200 million. As maximum, they feel we have
                            positive obligation to help them bring reserve up to that level. (I am
                            not arguing that we should or can ignore <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> foreign exchange level, simply reporting the way they
                            look at it.) Moreover, at least since I came here in October 1961,
                            Vietnamese have been led to believe that US would support <gloss
                                target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> up to whatever level required for war
                            effort, provided only that Staley-Thuc and limited worldwide procurement
                            criteria respected. Their need, in budgetary terms, has never been
                            greater, notwithstanding their acceptance of deficit financing and
                            prospect of deficit this year on order of <gloss target="#t_VN1"
                                >VN</gloss> $4 to 5 billion (or 5 to 6 percent of GNP).</p>
                        <p>In this situation any backing off from <gloss target="#t_CIP1"
                                >CIP</gloss> of about $100 million is bound to be interpreted by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as failure on our part to live
                            up to a bargain. Perhaps we can read the fine print differently but this
                            is certainly the way they feel.</p>
                        <p>It is on above grounds that I would urge that <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> Administrator allot full $15 million from contingency
                            fund. Recent events are, I think, probably not relevant in <gloss

                            strong but actions <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has taken have
                            not been thought of, I believe, as a concession to US but as necessary,

                            5 PM this afternoon (June 8) within minutes after my request. He was
                            throughout two hour interview entirely relaxed and friendly, and he
                            permitted frequent interruptions <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0393"
                            />in a way that is rare for him. Unfortunately, I have no reason to
                            believe that anything I said to him moved him. Opened by giving him
                            French text of Women’s Solidarity Movement (<gloss target="#t_WSM1"
                                >WSM</gloss>) resolution. He read it line by line as if he had never
                            seen it before. (Nothing he said subsequently indicated prior
                            knowledge.) I went on to explain that I had been profoundly disappointed
                            to see this resolution. I had understood that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> commission under Vice President had achieved large
                            measure of agreement with Buddhist leaders on their demands (late in
                            conversation he himself summarized terms of agreement very much as
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> had given them to
                            me), and that among other things it had been understood that there would
                            be a truce (detente) on propaganda from both sides pending final
                            settlement. <gloss target="#t_WSM1">WSM</gloss> resolution seemed to me
                            a violation of this. I wanted therefore to ask if he would disavow it,
                            would dissociate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> from it. I feared
                            that otherwise we might see renewal of agitation and demonstrations
                            bringing on government repressive measures and in effect loss of all
                            that had been achieved in past week. I pointed out also that if this
                            came to pass my government would very likely consider that <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was at fault and would have to
                            dissociate itself from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions—as it
                            had already done in denying that <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            planes had been used in lifting troops to Hue (<persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> confirmed that he had read

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said at once that he could

                            his later remarks, I fear that the general sentiments of resolution are
                            close to his own. However, he limited himself to saying that it was
                            necessary to warn people against extremists who were misusing affair to
                            further their own interests. (He rarely referred to <gloss

                        <p>I also said I had heard reports that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>

                        <p>Remainder of conversation consisted largely of <persName

                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position. Main points of this are
                            outlined below. In general, it was a hard line and, although he said he
                            was ready to continue talks with Buddhists, neither his attitude nor his

                            to foreign press. He brushed aside my argument that there has not been
                            time for word to filter down on Buddhists’ side and charged that
                            BonzeThich Minh (principal negotiator from Hue) was passing out line
                            that government has capitulated.</p>
                        <p>At one point in long conversation, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> charged in terms [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that
                            Buddhists had been negotiating in bad faith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> also believes that troubles
                            in Hue stem primarily from ineptitude of local <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> officials. But fault is not their actions on May 8 but
                            rather that prior to that date they had given too much encouragement to
                            “certain” Buddhist elements. Thereafter their delinquencies consisted in
                            not carrying out effective security measures and in not filing prompt
                            reports on what had happened. It was not until May 24, for example, that
                            chief medical official completed report showing that May 8 deaths
                            resulted from concussion rather than fragmentation grenades.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> if he was saying
                            that, if disturbances resumed, stronger measures should be used. He
                            replied “the necessary measures”. Public order had of course to be
                            maintained. He went on to say things which suggested to me that he
                            believes that improved situation in last few days is result of more
                            effective security measures. He may of course be right but, in any
                            event, he is clearly giving higher priority to security measures than to
                            negotiations for immediate future.</p>
                        <p>In course of discussion I used every argument I could muster to persuade
                            him that only satisfactory solution, at least from US point of view, was
                            peaceful one, through negotiations. I also said quite flatly that, in my
                            opinion, author of resolution (well known to both of us to be <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName>) was seeking to undermine
                            agreement already reached. Finally, I expressed resentment at reference
                            in resolution to “those inclined to take Vietnam for a satellite of a
                            foreign power”. This phraseology, I said, we had learned to translate as
                            “USA”. All this he received with equanimity.</p>
                        <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0395"/>
                        <p>At end of meeting I repeated arguments used at beginning and asked him to
                            reconsider question of disavowing resolution. He did not reply-and this
                            is only possibly bright spot I have to report.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, I would recommend that Department make no statement and
                            that we watch events for a day or so. It may be that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will react belatedly to my
                            arguments today—he sometimes does. Or it may be that <gloss
                                target="#t_WSM1">WSM</gloss> resolution will not have effect on
                            negotiations that I anticipate. In any event, there seems to be no
                            advantage in precipitate action. I will of course be doing what I can
                            with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> to try to keep
                            negotiations on the track.</p>

                                    gather news. I told <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                        >Thuan</persName> that this struck me as foolish and

                                    wanting to miss any news but on other hand not wanting to be

                                    stated that I was concerned with reports that people inside

                                    said I had other reports that they were afraid to come out for
                                    fear of arrest and that police were also asking their friends

                                    informed him that after our conversation yesterday he had

                                    under banner headline in today’s English-language Times of

                                    concluded meeting by telling <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"

                                    went far beyond religious issue involved. I thought that as a

                                    more than offset all the progress which had been made here in

                            that President should take this whole affair into his own hands and
                            ensure that those negotiating with Buddhists were not undercut from any

                                and Ngo Trong Hieu indicated that “as of that time <persName

                                    >Trueheart</persName> noted, however, that the situation had
                                been “drastically changed by self-cremation of bonze in Central
                                Saigon.” He stated that an emergency Cabinet session began sitting
                                at 11:30 a.m. to consider the situation. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> at his house at lunch
                            time. He had talked with President and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> this morning. Contrary reftel, he said there had
                            been no Cabinet meeting. President had talked with individual ministers,
                            however, and might assemble Cabinet this afternoon. He was urging
                            conciliatory action on President and thought he was making some headway.
                            His mood was quite different from last night, and I would guess that
                            events of this morning have considerably strengthened his personal
                            position.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> that, in my
                            judgment, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position abroad and
                            probably in the country was very precarious. I doubted that position
                            could be restored without an immediate, dramatic and conciliatory move
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> personally.

                            he would have to make his move in a manner which I knew went against his
                            grain. I told Thuan, again as a personal opinion, that I thought if
                            President did not do something of this sort this afternoon he might well
                            be faced with a public US Government disassociation of itself from whole
                            affair, with quite possibly a strong overtone of disapproval of <gloss

                            (This is, in fact, what I now recommend to Department unless we have
                            action or the promise of it before the day is out.) <persName

                            notes of this and said he would bring it to the attention of the

                                with Buddhist leaders were continuing. He stated that extremists had
                                distorted the facts of the situation, but he assured Buddhists that

                                (i.e., flying of Buddhist flags outside pagoda premises). Whether
                                Buddhist reaction was spontaneous or premeditated is not clear;
                                however, those actions in fact articulated long-standing Buddhist
                                sense of grievance at religious discrimination. By now Buddhist
                                actions have taken on political significance, partly because of
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s slowness to react
                                politically to Buddhist demands, speed with which it has exercised
                                repressive measures, transparent attempts of <gloss target="#t_GVN1"

                                their five demands, sufficient momentum may have developed behind
                                their protest movement so that five demands will themselves be given
                                liberal interpretation or be overtaken by larger and more extensive
                                demands. Some Buddhists are reportedly talking about bringing about

                            <item>Opposition to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s position has
                                tended to unify Buddhist groups; moreover, there is evidence that

                                population in bid for their support. Their reasonably successful

                                quandary, which to some extent explains its slow and uncertain

                        <p>B. At this moment, we believe there is still some chance that <gloss

                            Buddhists. This will depend on whether dialogue between two parties can

                            distrust on both sides. Even assuming that agreement can now be
                            reached—and that Buddhist leaders can rally rank and file support for
                            it—Buddhist revolt and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s record of

                            pop up elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>It is in context possibility that two parties can come to terms that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will be most receptive to
                            suggestions under parts A and B of <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 1196. Regarding part A, suggestions (1) and (2) have
                            already been raised informally with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName>, who indicated that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> exploring what action feasible on Decree 10 and that no
                            official <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> commemoration planned for
                            Pope John. We would be reluctant pass on suggestion (3) which certain to
                            irritate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but unlikely have any
                            important benefits, if accepted, since we doubt seriously that public
                            understands Personalism or its background sufficiently for
                            soft-pedalling it to have any impact. Re (4), I will suggest to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> that he explore ways
                            and means to raise this with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Suggestions under part B are of course for longer term. Their
                            implementation now unlikely aid current situation materially, since any
                            impact would take time. We concerned at suggestion (3) under part B,
                            since it implies “packing the Assembly” with US blessing; also, given
                            nature Assembly, Buddhists likely consider Assembly monks as kept men.
                            Further, we question whether good idea deliberately mix religion and
                            politics. We will explore how handle this one, but inclined believe we
                            should go no further than suggesting that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> consider feasibility of monks presenting candidacies
                            for Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Above estimate was prepared prior self-cremation incident and today’s
                            talk with Thuan. If dialogue between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            and Buddhists breaks down or becomes harsher <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> likely be unwilling take actions Buddhist could
                            interpret as weakness. For example, in connection with suggestion
                            regarding monks in National Assembly, believe we cannot rule out
                            possibility that if Buddhist unrest continues, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will postpone Assembly elections
                            altogether or carry them out in “safe” areas of country.</p>

                            take dramatic action to regain confidence of Buddhists and that the

                            meet Buddhist demands as set forth in <gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1"

                        <p>You further authorized to tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                            few days the US will find it necessary publicly to state that it cannot
                            associate itself with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s
                            unwillingness to meet the reasonable demands of the Vietnamese Buddhist

                        <p>There follows various argumentation which you authorized to use in whole

                        <p>The US understands that a public statement may have political

                            reluctantly since it continues to support President Diem. However, the
                            international repercussions of the Buddhist troubles in South Viet-Nam
                            cannot help but affect US world-wide responsibilities. In addition, US
                            support of Vietnamese Government requires full support of Congress and
                            American people and question as to our attitude towards and our
                            involvement in Buddhist problem must be effectively dealt with if
                            satisfactory solution is not arrived at very quickly. Furthermore, <pb

                            the Government of South Viet-Nam to take action to regain confidence of
                            Buddhists. No government in Viet-Nam can survive without their
                            support.</p>
                        <p>We realize that meeting Buddhist demands as set forth in <gloss
                                target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss> 1038 runs risk of engendering
                            further Buddhist demands and that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            must be prepared to face and very likely accede to such further demands
                            unless they are so substantive as to endanger <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> defense effort. Nevertheless fact is that Buddhist
                            demands so far have been reasonable and/or insubstantial. In fact <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has already gone most of way to meet
                            them. What is necessary is that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> so
                            state clearly and that it abide by such decision firmly before it is too
                            late.</p>
                        <p>Risk of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> yielding now far less than
                            pursuing continued standoff position when, actually, there is very
                            little of substance separating <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            responsible Buddhists. At present we believe situation has gone so far
                            that to regain public confidence a joint statement by <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and Buddhist leaders is needed to
                            restore public confidence.</p>
                        <p>At same time we recognize risks to public order and safety if public
                            gatherings are permitted at this time and importance to <gloss

                                    religious processions constitute an outward manifestation of

                            of activities in Hue and is reputed to have considerable flair as a
                            demagogue. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> indicated
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was worried that Hue delegation
                            would not proceed promptly to conference table but devote themselves
                            first to some agitation in Saigon. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            concern was heightened when they received word that group wants to walk
                            into Saigon from airport.</p>
                        <p>Re negotiating instructions, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> continues to believe that commission will get what
                            it needs from President in way of concessions but he admitted that
                            certain unspecified essential points had not as yet been firmly pinned
                            down.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> that I thought it
                            essential in terms of US support that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> be prepared to make meaningful and substantial
                            concessions to the Buddhist demands. It was my assessment that <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had consistently underestimated force
                            and determination of Buddhists. After first talks with Buddhists last
                            week, situation had quickly calmed down in Hue, whereupon <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had decided that danger had passed and
                            they <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0410"/>could get away with
                            reaffirmation of minor concessions already granted and prevent further
                            outburst by security measures. This was situation as of June 10.
                            Following regrettable incident on morning June 11, <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had again begun to think of
                            concessions. (<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> did.not
                            disagree with any of this.) Now situation again appeared relatively calm
                            in Saigon. I hoped that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would not
                            again conclude that it can get out of this affair on the cheap. I did
                            not think the Buddhists would stand for this, and if they did not—and
                            possibly even if they did-the US wouldn’t, in my opinion. I told him

                                >Thuan</persName> at first said he thought it would be best to let

                            however, he suggested that I put in request through regular channels to
                            see the President this afternoon or tomorrow morning. This I have done.
                            He recommended that I “talk as tough” to President as I have to him.</p>

                        <p>Referring to point in suggested communique about banning of public
                            processions by any religious group, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> pointed out that tomorrow, June 13, is the Fete de
                            Dieu (Corpus Christi), that Catholic processions were scheduled and
                            indeed this was only day in religious calendar on which Catholic liturgy
                            prescribes processions. If he banned them tomorrow, resentment of
                            Catholics would be strong. I explained to president that burden of my
                            demarche was in first three paragraphs of memorandum; remainder was
                            argumentation and a suggestion for a communique. I doubted that
                            Washington had considered the Fete de Dieu angle, but in any case the
                            sentence to which he referred was put in, I was sure, to provide a
                            rationale for temporary banning of Buddhist processions and
                            demonstrations. With regard to tomorrow, he would have to decide whether
                            to permit the Catholic <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0412"
                            />processions, taking into account the expected effect on public order
                            and on the negotiations with the Buddhists. I noted that, although
                            Catholics would doubtless resent the banning of their processions, the
                            gesture might be all the more appreciated by the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>There was, rather surprisingly, no further discussion of substance of
                            memorandum. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said [<hi
                                rend="italic">he</hi>] would have to reflect on it and would not, in
                            any case, wish to take a decision until discussion with Buddhists had
                            begun. I said that I had not expected an immediate reply but asked if I
                            could expect that he or <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            would keep me informed as discussions with Buddhists proceeded. He
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, I mentioned three items of information which I said had
                            given me some concern: (1) A report that arrests were continuing June 11
                            in Danang and Hue. I thought it would be most regrettable if the
                            authorities were retaliating against people involved in recent
                            demonstrations. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not
                            reply but <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> later told me
                            that he would personally look into report. (2) I understood that some
                            Vietnamese authorities (actually Minister of Interior, as I later told
                            Thuan) were considering prosecuting for murder persons who had assisted
                            bonze to cremate himself yesterday. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> said he understood other persons had assisted bonze
                            to cover himself with gasoline and had set fire to him. I said that I
                            had talked to two eye witnesses who saw bonze set fire to himself but,
                            whatever the facts, any action against others involved would be a very
                            grave mistake. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> later said
                            he would see to it that this idea was killed. (3) I had heard that entry
                            to Saigon from the provinces had been barred to all monks. President and
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> acknowledged that
                            this was so and said that they considered it dangerous to public safety
                            to permit bonzes to converge on Saigon at this particular time. I said
                            that the public safety was of course his responsibility and I did not
                            press the point.</p>
                        <p>Meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> lasted less
                            than an hour.</p>
                        <p>Later, in <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>’s office, he
                            told me he had had a very serious (he called it climactic) conversation
                            with President at mid-day, in which he had pressed President very hard
                            to face facts and adopt conciliatory posture. He thought he had had some
                            success. He said that he had emphasized to President that many people
                            were afraid to tell him the truth but that he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, considered that it was his
                            duty to tell the President “everything” and he had proceeded to do
                            so.</p>

                            <item>Immediately after arrival of Buddhist delegation June 12, Vice
                                President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> sent them
                                letter proposing that delegation meet with <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                    >GVN</gloss> commission at 1800 same day. (This and other
                                letters mentioned this message cast in polite and respectful
                                language.) Buddhists replied that head bonze <persName

                                a result of 5-day fast and flight to Saigon and would be “incapable
                                of thinking or acting for 3 or 5 days, the more so since Buddhism is
                                at present observing mourning (grand deuil) throughout the country.”
                                Letter proposed meeting take place “on another day which would be

                                last night that his commission had proposed early meeting because of
                                desire expressed by Buddhists in a June 8 letter “to proceed rapidly
                                to a satisfactory arrangement.” <persName corresp="#p_THO1"

                                    >GVN</gloss> commission understood had been agreed. <gloss

                                acceptance of “5 points” in full plus broadening of certain of them.
                                Finally, Buddhists have implied that commission’s acceptance June 5
                                agreement committed <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, whereas it
                                was ad referendum, as demonstrated by fact Minh had insisted on
                                returning to Hue to put agreement before his principals. When I
                                questioned <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> as to
                                nature of additional Buddhist demands, he said that there were
                                several and some were complicated but he cited as examples that (a)
                                on flag issue, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would agree
                                authorization of local authorities would not be required, (b)
                                pagodas, which for centuries have been community property in
                                hamlets, should be “turned over to administration of Buddhists”
                                    (<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he himself
                                was not sure what this meant) and (c) on Law No.10 Buddhists
                                proposed not only that Assembly amend it, as had been agreed, but
                                that in meantime President should amend it by decree.</item>

                                was disturbed over Buddhist insistence on getting full satisfaction
                                before coming to meeting. Commission also felt obliged to set record
                                straight about June 5 agreement, particularly as they had described
                                it to President in very different terms. Commission was therefore
                                meeting at 1500 to draft reply, which he thought would first set out

                            <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> that I did
                                not think this was nearly good enough. What we were talking about
                                was dramatic, conciliatory move. Reply he described would have
                                appearance of careful preparation for bazaar-type negotiation.
                                Buddhists could use it as an excuse for breaking off talks, if that
                                was what they wanted to do. Moreover, differences between two
                                versions, as he described them, did not seem to me to be of great
                                importance.</item>

                            <item>After some discussion-in the course of which I sought to revive
                                yesterday’s mood of urgency and in which <persName
                                    corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> did not develop any other
                                idea himself on how to deal with letter-I suggested that
                                commission’s reply might state that, while Buddhists’ letter does
                                not accord in all respects with commission’s understanding of June 5
                                agreement, commission in spirit of amity and in interests of moving
                                forward accepts Buddhists’ statement of agreement in principle <pb
                                    n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0415"/>and as basis for
                                discussion. Letter could also refer to need for clarification of
                                certain points, if that was the case. Such a reply, it seemed to me,
                                would be difficult for Buddhists to reject and was in keeping with
                                spirit of conciliation and with object of restoring Buddhists’
                                confidence in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I reminded
                                    <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> also that while
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and Buddhists were busy
                                writing letters to each other, possibility of incidents was ever
                                present, whereas I felt there was less chance of this while parties
                                were actually at conference table. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                    >Thuan</persName> seemed immediately attracted by my suggestion

                        <p>Viet-Nam Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHLT1">Koren</persName> commented that
                            the Vietnamese action to follow through on funding of <gloss
                                target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> project has been most encouraging. About
                            64% of the rural population has been incorporated into the strategic
                            hamlet program, and the hamlets now completed are over one-half of the
                            projected goal. The press has reacted favorably to recent efforts to
                            brief them on military operations. The Group reviewed the Buddhist
                            problem and expressed concern over the hesitancy of the Vietnamese
                            Government to take action to ease the situation. It was acknowledged
                            that the situation could rapidly become more serious, but that the
                            Country Team is handling the situation well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> inquired about the
                            validity of the number of returnees reflected in the status report, and
                            what follow-through procedures are utilized to convert them into useful
                            citizens. He observed that if good results have been achieved in this
                            program, these facts should be exploited in the press. The Group
                            requested State to submit a report on the results achieved in this
                                program.<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">No such report has been found.

                        <p>161/SPU/T. For several years now we have followed with sorrow the
                            development of the exceedingly cruel religious persecution of the monks
                            and faithful of the Cambodian Buddhist community in South Viet-Nam. In
                            vain, we have attempted to alert international public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Today, this persecution has overtaken the Vietnamese Buddhists
                            themselves. Their nonviolent protests and the heroic act of martyrdom of
                            the venerable Thich <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quang Duc</persName> have
                            roused the conscience of the world. Through my voice, Cambodia, where
                            Buddhism is a State religion, and the Cambodian people, deeply moved by
                            the suffering of the Buddhists of South Viet-Nam, beg Your Excellency to
                            intercede with the full force of your moral prestige and that of your
                            country to the end that the Catholic South Vietnamese Government may
                            accord Buddhists the right to practice freely their religion of peace
                            and brotherhood.</p>
                        <p>Here in Southeast Asia, where the coexistence of all religions had been
                            established in an atmosphere of reciprocal tolerance and esteem, it
                            rests with the great powers to bring back to reason a government that
                            has revived religious conflicts that had been quiescent for more than a

                            delayed due servicing and just received. Without speculating on actions
                            which might have seemed advisable had message been received promptly, I
                            do not think it would be wise to take any action now on numbered
                            paragraph 1. At this time, we have formal agreement between <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and Buddhist leadership and outward
                            calm throughout the country, following a relatively minor outburst in
                            Saigon this morning. Moreover, notwithstanding that my misgivings about
                            Ngo family including <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> have
                            greatly increased during last two weeks, I am still not impressed by the
                            competition, nor do I think are any of my colleagues American or
                            foreign.</p>
                        <p>Our best move at this juncture—and one I propose to make unless otherwise
                            instructed—is to press <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            directly and indirectly to accept Buddhist crisis as blessing in
                            disguise and to use agreement reached as stepping stone to concessions
                            to other groups (before they demand them). The whole operation would be
                            keyed to building up popular <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0425"
                            />support for regime prior to August parliamentary elections and
                            importantly also to making sure that paper undertakings to Buddhists are
                            carried out in full measure.</p>
                        <p>This scheme will doubtless be regarded as naive by anyone who knows this
                            country (and it is certainly the longest of shots). Moreover, I fear
                            that my own ability to put it across may have been diminished by my
                            actions on Buddhist affair and that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            confidence in our ability to carry out private diplomacy is gravely
                            undermined by NY Times story. I nevertheless think that we should give
                            this approach a fair try. If we find <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> in a mood to freeze up, rather than move forward,
                            then I think his days are indeed numbered and we must begin to make
                            moves along the lines of para 1, <gloss target="#t_DEPTEL1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 1219.</p>
                        <p>Re para 2, there are no bars whatsoever on contacts and we are receiving
                            just now a surfeit of coup talk and anti-regime comment. It is to be
                            expected in such circumstances that one is never in contact with the
                            people (if any) who really mean business, but we have all the lines out
                            that we know how to put out and have had for some days. However,
                            everyone is as usual under strict instructions not to encourage coup
                            talk and to meet any that arises with firm statement of US support for
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. I called on Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> June 18 to congratulate
                            him on success his mission in reaching agreement with Buddhists. He
                            seemed genuinely to appreciate the gesture.</p>
                        <p>In course of conversation, <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            acknowledged that negotiations had been quite difficult. He denied,
                            however, that Buddhist demands had gone so far as in effect to amount to
                            demand that Buddhism become “established” church Vietnam. (British
                            Ambassador had gotten this impression from his separate talk with
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>.) Vice President said
                            that he thought Buddhists were satisfied with results and that if there
                            were no misunderstandings (malentendus) in implementing agreement, there
                            should be no further trouble. However, he made it clear that he thought
                            there was considerable possibility of misunderstandings. For example,
                            when I said I had been pleased to see that the communique<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d180fn2">See <ref target="#d178">Document 178</ref>.</note>
                            provided for continuation of his commission to supervise implementation
                            and asked how this would be accomplished, he said that complaints would
                            be referred to commission and that Minister of Interior (member of
                            commission) had all the means necessary to deal with them, provided he
                            had the necessary support from above. <persName corresp="#p_THO1"
                                >Tho</persName> was obviously not sure that he would.</p>
                        <p>Vice President asked me whether I thought agreements were fair, and I
                            said I thought they were. However, it seemed to me that they should be
                            regarded by government as point of departure, rather than conclusion of
                            a difficult episode. I thought that events since May 8 had left deep and
                            widespread scars and that government had suffered severe loss of support
                            in all important segments of population. Question now was whether
                            government would conclude danger had passed and draw back and tighten up
                            or whether it would move forward with actions to restore lost
                            confidence. This I thought would require not <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401"
                                facs="0427"/>only faithful carrying out of agreement but concessions
                            to other grievances. Unfortunately, I said, such indications as had yet
                            appeared suggested tightening up. Vice President nodded throughout this
                            but limited himself to saying that I “understood the problem well”.</p>
                        <p>Earlier in the day, I talked to <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> along much the same lines, only more bluntly. I
                            told him that, in my opinion, President had not only suffered severe
                            loss confidence in Vietnam but also in Washington. I also spelled out
                            for him, as I had not done for Vice President, indications which led me
                            to believe that there was at least strong pressure on the President to
                            tighten up. I mentioned the anomalous meeting at headquarters of Women’s
                            Solidarity Movement on the morning of announcement of agreement at which
                            tape recordings of June 7 resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">See

                            had been read. I cited news reports in Times of Vietnam June 17 which
                            sought to place “responsibility for hysteria which has been created in
                            past week squarely on shoulders of those who for undisclosed reasons
                            delayed final signing,” and another statement that, although communique
                            states that those supporting Buddhists’ 5 demands will benefit from
                            Presidential clemency, “there is no clear agreement to absolve
                            completely those who provoked the affairs of the last two weeks.” I
                            pointed out also that we had solid evidence that certain elements of
                            security forces were devoting their major attention to activities and
                            movements of Americans rather than <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or
                            Buddhists. Finally I cited specific incident of apparent harassment of
                            American (see separate <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                                telegram).<note n="4" xml:id="d180fn4">Not found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> asked me what sort of
                            further <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concessions I had in mind. I
                            replied that it would not be difficult to produce specific suggestions
                            but I thought it would be better if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            came up with ideas of its own. Specific suggestions from US would, I
                            feared, be tainted in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> mind. One area
                            which immediately suggested itself, however, was that of justice, viz.,
                            bringing long-detained prisoners to trial, etc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> indicated agreement with
                            my analysis of problem but did not otherwise react.</p>
                        <p>Unless Department has objection, I shall push along on these lines as I
                            am able to find opportunities to do so.</p>

                        <p>The Government should consider other gestures of good faith which
                            recognize that the Buddhists are sincere and that they are entitled to
                            an honored place in the Vietnamese nation.</p>
                        <p>The joint communique of June 16 in which agreement was reached on the

                            Government’s actions closely. The Buddhist leaders are well organized
                            and have not permitted the Communists or political opposition elements
                            to take control. They are a disciplined and peaceful people who must be

                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government’s manner of
                            implementing its agreement with South Vietnam’s Buddhist leaders could
                            give rise to renewed difficulties. This memorandum examines the
                            implications of such difficulties for the stability of the regime.</p>
                        <p rend="center">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>What appeared to be an isolated Buddhist incident in the city of Hue
                            quickly became a national crisis that crystallized long-standing
                            resentment of what Buddhist leaders regard as the privileged position
                            occupied by the minority Roman Catholic church of which President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, his family, and a
                            disproportionate number of civil and military officials are members.</p>
                        <p>The speed with which the Buddhist issue reached critical proportions was
                            largely the result of the position adopted by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his family who misread the
                            seriousness of the Buddhist movement and attributed it to political and
                            even Communist inspiration. Until June 16 such concessions as were made
                            to the Buddhists were clearly piecemeal and grudging. On June 16,
                            however, against a background of sharply-increased Buddhist tensions and
                            United States pressure, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government signed an agreement with Buddhist leaders that, for the first
                            time, accommodated all their demands.</p>
                        <p>A degree of calm having been resolved [<hi rend="italic">reached</hi>?]
                            by the June 16 agreement, much will now obviously depend on the
                            sincerity and speed with which it is implemented. If the regime is
                            conspicuously dilatory, inept, and insincere in handling Buddhist
                            matters, renewed tension would probably again reach crisis proportions.
                            Disaffection within the bureaucracy and the army, coupled with popular
                            discontent and disorders, would almost certainly give rise to coup
                            efforts. Such an effort if led, as it probably would be, by top and
                            middle-echelon military and civil officials, would probably have good
                            prospects of success. A successful coup, while posing real dangers of
                            major internal upheaval and a serious slackening of the military effort
                            against the <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0432"/>Viet Cong, could
                            draw upon a reservoir of trained and experienced personnel for
                            reasonably effective leadership of the government and the war
                            effort.</p>

                        <p>A new Buddhist crisis, in the wake of any failure on the part of the
                            regime to fulfill its commitments, would almost certainly give rise to
                            coup efforts. A resurgence of open Buddhist hostility would again be
                            reflected in demonstrations and, almost inevitably, bloodshed. Most
                            Buddhist leaders, although not themselves likely to assume command of a
                            movement to overthrow the government, would probably be inclined to
                            favor a drastic political change as the only means by which their
                            grievances could [<hi rend="italic">be</hi>] remedied. Even before
                            Buddhist-led disturbances reached serious or widespread proportions,
                            however, the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> leadership
                            would probably be faced with an open revolt within the bureaucracy and
                            the military establishment.</p>
                        <p>Some of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s principal
                            supporters might seek to counsel compromise and reform, but the futility
                            of such counsel in the past, knowledge that officials have been removed
                            or isolated for urging compromise, and the substantially-increased
                            influence of the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s would tend
                            to deter this effort. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> probably would not listen to such advice,
                            particularly to any recommendations that suggest removing the Nhus or
                            even restricting their authority.</p>
                        <p>A revolt against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            leadership could occur in several ways. For example, an army unit
                            commander in the field, reacting rather spontaneously and without prior
                            planning, might refuse orders from Saigon to use force to suppress a
                            demonstration and might even openly indicate his support of the Buddhist
                            cause. Apart from his personal sympathies, he might be motivated by fear
                            of mutiny by his troops or armed action by the local populace aided by
                            the Viet Cong. In any event, this open defiance of the government could
                            quickly spread to other units, gain support within the top military
                            leadership and the civil bureaucracy, and reach a climax in a major
                            coordinated coup effort against the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> family in Saigon. Counteractions by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, which he would have time to
                            prepare in a revolt of this kind, could lead to armed conflict within
                            military ranks and a protracted struggle between pro and anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> forces.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively a revolt could be precipitated in Saigon, aimed at
                            resolving the situation quickly without excessive armed conflict and
                            bloodshed and without weakening the military front against the Viet
                            Cong. The initial action in Saigon would not preclude coordinated
                            supporting actions elsewhere. A revolt staged in this fashion would <pb
                                n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0433"/>almost certainly require
                            considerable prior planning and probably the participation of middle and
                            top military and civil officials. The abortive 1960 coup, however, may
                            well have impressed potential coup leaders with the necessity of better
                            planning and broader participation by army and government elements and
                            with the potential dangers posed by succumbing to protracted
                            negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong would probably not be able to initiate or gain control of a
                            successful and ostensibly non-Communist revolt. More likely, they would
                            make every effort to provoke militant action by the Buddhists and to
                            encourage disaffection among local government officials and army field
                            units. Once a revolt had been launched, they would attempt to strengthen
                            their military and political positions locally. In the main, they would
                            be looking for a general breakdown of government authority in the
                            countryside.</p>
                        <p>Nor do we believe that the diversified array of non-Communist
                            oppositionists outside the government could initiate or lead a
                            successful coup. These oppositionists have consistently demonstrated
                            their inability to unite under a common cause or leader. Many of them
                            are opportunists whose political views range from neutralism to possible
                            pro-Communist sympathies and who have little support outside their
                            immediate personal following. However, some appear more responsible,
                            have contacts within the government, and might be acceptable as
                            participants although not necessarily as leaders in a revolt,
                            particularly if they had gained support within Buddhist circles.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the most likely revolt, however staged, would be
                            non-Communist and fully committed to the counterinsurgency effort, have
                            appreciable support within the government, and include middle and top
                            echelon military and civil officials. Nevertheless, we do not feel that
                            a major polarization of the South Vietnamese military and civilian
                            leadership into active coup and anti-coup groups will necessarily occur.
                            While most of them would probably favor the coup, if it is clearly
                            anti-Communist, many might still hesitate to commit themselves actively
                            at the outset and would give their tacit or active support to whatever
                            side appeared to have the best chance of winning. However, we believe
                            that this would tend to work to the advantage of the coup leaders. Under
                            these circumstances, the revolt would have a fair-to-good chance of
                            succeeding.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                            his family are prepared to capitulate without a fight, but we see it as
                            equally unlikely that they would be permitted any alternative other than
                            to resign or face death. The removal of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> family would probably precipitate a power struggle
                            within the government, but ultimately would tend to strengthen the role
                            of the military. It is not impossible that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s successor could come from outside the ranks of
                            the present government. A government led by a military junta or by Vice
                            President <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0434"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_NNT1">Nguyen Ngoc Tho</persName> is more likely,
                            however, with the army, in the latter case, playing a major if not
                            predominant role behind the scenes. On the one hand, the military might
                            conclude that a military-led government would be better able to maintain
                            national unity and internal political cohesion and, more importantly, to
                            conduct a determined and effective campaign against the Viet Cong. On
                            the other hand, they might conclude that <persName corresp="#p_THO1"
                                >Tho</persName> would share their views on the manner of conducting
                            the fight against the Viet Cong and that his constitutional succession
                            would legitimize the change in government and possibly avert a serious
                            power struggle. The possibility for successful cooperation between
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> and military leaders is
                            good; he is apparently on cordial terms with a number of them, and is
                            also competent and widely respected in and outside the government.</p>
                        <p>The sudden removal of South Vietnam’s authoritarian and long-established
                            regime, whatever the character of the successor government, would pose
                            real dangers of major internal upheaval and a serious slackening of the
                            military effort against the Viet Cong. Certainly it is open to question
                            whether any successor to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            could, on the one hand, provide the same firm anti-Communist leadership,
                            or on the, other, assure a more efficient and less authoritarian
                            administration. Nevertheless, there is a reasonably large pool of
                            untapped or ineffectively used but experienced and trained manpower not
                            only within the military and civilian sectors of the present government
                            but also, to some extent outside, that, given the opportunity and
                            continued support from the United States, could provide reasonably
                            effective leadership for the government and the war effort and make
                            possible broader participation in the administration.</p>

                        <p>The public reaction of the United States might well determine the failure
                            or success of any armed revolt against <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will
                            almost certainly expect quick, publicly expressed, and strong support
                            and would feel that he no longer had United States confidence if such
                            support were not forthcoming. Indeed, he might immediately leap to the
                            conclusion that the United States had inspired the action or was
                            actively assisting the rebels. Under these circumstances, if <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> were able to defeat the rebels,
                            the United States would meet with increased difficulty in efforts to
                            guide and influence <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            policies. Even should the United States publicly come to <persName

                            commitments might not be fulfilled were <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> to succeed in putting down the revolt. A victory in

                                >Diem</persName>’s view that he is indispensable, that he knows best
                            what the situation requires, and that he cannot trust anyone outside his
                            immediate family.</p>

                        <p>The rebels and the fence sitters too would be looking for some indication
                            of the United States position. Our silence over any period or
                            indications that we regarded the revolt as an internal problem which we
                            hoped to see quickly resolved would probably be taken as support for the
                            rebels. This, or any other evidence that the United States was not
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, would probably
                            inspire broader participation in the rebel effort, and if it were
                            successful, enable the United States to influence the formation and
                            policies of the successor government. On the other hand, obvious United
                            States support for the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            government would tend to deter participation in the rebel effort. If
                            nevertheless the rebel effort were successful we could anticipate
                            considerable hostility toward the United States in the new
                            administration.</p>

                            destroy the agreement. I felt obliged to tell him that, if agreement did
                            break down and demonstrations resumed, I thought my government would as
                            matters stood put the blame on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I
                            reminded him that Buddhist leaders were still in Saigon waiting, as they
                            said, for evidence of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> good faith and
                            specifically for release of persons arrested. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said they were being released as

                            released. (He said that some youths had been found to be members of
                            Communist youth organization.) He also implied that he had at least
                            serious doubts about releasing people who had thrown rocks at police

                            was speaking as a friend but in any event I had to tell him that he was
                            in a very grave position, in my opinion, and had to take drastic
                            measures, going beyond religious questions, if confidence in his
                            government was to be restored.</p>
                        <p>I ended by saying that situation seemed to me to be especially tragic
                            because there had been undeniable progress on the military side and in
                            the Strategic Hamlet Program and this progress had continued all during
                            Buddhist affair. It nevertheless had to be recognized that latter could
                            overturn everything that had been accomplished. Whatever he might think
                            about situation, he must accept that he was under most virulent
                            editorial attack in US and that political pressure on US Government was
                            intense.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not dispute any of this.
                            He simply said sadly that Buddhist affair had been blown up out of all
                            proportion. What people should be worried about was situation in
                                Laos.<note n="9" xml:id="d185fn9">A marginal note on the source text

                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> called me in this morning
                            for what turned out to be longish post-mortem on my meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> June 22. He said
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had since discussed
                            meeting with him twice and had shown him paper I had left. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was disturbed (I gathered he
                            meant angry) over what he had been told and suspicious that we were
                            trying to undermine him.</p>
                        <p>I recounted conversation for <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> and again went over with him our thinking
                            regarding gravity of situation arising from Buddhist affair. I said we
                            had been supporting <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for a long time and that what I
                            had done my best to get over to President was that our pressure resulted
                            from our real and serious concern that he must take steps to restore
                            loss of support in this country. We were also trying to bring home
                            effects of Buddhist affair in U.S. We were, in short, trying to help him
                            rather than undermine him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> again said he agreed with
                            our analysis of Buddhist problem, and he was doing and would do
                            everything he could to see that June 16 agreement was faithfully carried
                            out. He added, with great seriousness, that he was doing so because (a)
                            he thought “the fate of the nation” depended on it, and (b) his personal
                            good faith was engaged as one of the signers. I said I had never doubted
                            his own role in this affair.</p>
                        <p>I hoped he would succeed (he had not predicted that he would), but
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should bear in mind
                            that immediate problem was not simply one of carrying out agreement to
                            the letter but of genuinely convincing Buddhists of <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> good faith. This might well require, in
                            spirit at least, something more than literal compliance. Burden of proof
                            was rigidly and wrongly on the government, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> simply could not afford to have a
                            revival of demonstrations or bonzes burning in the street.</p>
                        <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>I told him that, in my judgment, Buddhist leaders were not only
                            suspicious re implementation of agreement but also very afraid that once
                            public interest has abated, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will
                            move in quietly to arrest principal leaders and take other repressive
                            measures. This very natural feeling would probably cause Buddhists to
                            hold out for maximum public action by <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> which would tend to get government openly committed on
                            details and hence give Buddhists some measure of protection against
                            reprisals. (<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> agreed this
                            was an important element in Buddhist thinking.) I urged him in this
                            connection to have published immediately the detailed orders he said had
                            been sent to provincial officials re implementation of agreement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> thought he could
                            arrange this.</p>
                        <p>Turning back to President—and I think this was main point he wanted to
                                convey—<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he was
                            very concerned over attitude of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> in face of pressures being exerted on him and of

                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> thought a new American
                            policy was involved and an effort to force him to do our bidding or to
                            unseat him. His reaction to this prospect, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> said, was one of extreme stubbornness. He had
                            said, and <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he was
                            trying to quote him exactly, “they can send ten Lodges, but I will not
                            permit myself or my country to be humiliated, not if they train their
                            artillery on this Palace.” <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> added that he knew, as I did, how stubborn
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was, and he was most
                            concerned over prospect of series of head-to-head confrontations.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I did not know what Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s instructions would be, but it
                            seemed to me that the way to avoid confrontations was for <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to begin to move now. They had to move
                            immediately anyway, in their own interests, not only to overcome effects
                            of Buddhist affair but also to prepare for August elections. Regarding
                            latter they had only three choices: (a) to cancel them, (b) to rig them,
                            or (c) to take actions designed to ensure heavy popular support (and
                            vote) for the government. First two alternatives would amount to
                            admission <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not have popular
                            support and were therefore unacceptable. Hence, <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> really had no choice but to get busy on the third. I
                            thought <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would know better than we
                            the sort of things it should do. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> said he agreed and he was sure elections would be

                            <item>North Vietnam has a large measure of independence within the
                                Communist Bloc, and it has avoided committing itself to either side
                                in the Sino-Soviet dispute. We believe that it will strive to
                                continue avoiding such a commitment. (Paras. 4, 8)</item>
                            <label>B.</label>
                            <item>In spite of its independent position, Hanoi has apparent sympathy
                                toward certain of Peiping’s positions in the dispute, and its
                                neutrality has recently shifted somewhat toward the Chinese. Hence,
                                if Hanoi is moved to commit itself further, it will probably be in
                                the direction of fuller support to Peiping. The development of an
                                open, formal break between Moscow and Peiping or the death of the
                                influential <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> would
                                increase the pressures for a North Vietnamese commitment. Even so,
                                Hanoi will almost certainly attempt to keep as great a measure of
                                independence as possible, and to maintain ties with Moscow. (Paras.

                            <item>Moscow almost certainly takes a more sober view than do Peiping
                                and Hanoi of the risk of a US intervention, and probably lays more
                                stress on political means for a Communist takeover in Laos. For
                                their part, the Chinese and North Vietnamese seek a quicker victory
                                through the application of military as well as political pressure.
                                Nevertheless, at the present level of activity, Soviet and Chinese
                                policies are in no essential conflict, and Hanoi has considerable
                                initiative and freedom of action. A drastic change of the situation
                                in Laos (e.g., the threat of large-scale US intervention) might
                                exacerbate Soviet-Chinese differences over policies to be pursued in
                                southeast Asia. However, in a crisis showdown with the US, we cannot
                                assume that Moscow would fail to support Peiping and Hanoi. (Paras.

                        <p>1. The announced objectives of the Government of North Vietnam (<gloss
                                target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) are: (a) “socialist
                            construction”—i.e., economic and political consolidation of the
                            territory controlled by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; and (b)
                            “peaceful unification” of all Vietnam—i.e., victory in the
                            Hanoi-directed insurgency in the south. Hanoi wants the support of both
                            Communist China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the
                            pursuit of these objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. North Vietnam’s internal problems are many and serious, reflecting the
                            pressures of rapid population growth against limited agricultural
                            resources and of an ambitious development program undertaken with an
                            extreme shortage of skilled and trained personnel. Agricultural
                            production is not fully adequate to meet the domestic needs of an
                            expanding population, let alone yield an exportable surplus. Although
                            North Vietnam appears to be reasonably well endowed with mineral
                            resources, it lacks the technological competence to exploit them
                            efficiently. Industry is rudimentary and inadequate to meet many
                            consumer needs. As a result, North Vietnam is dependent on its Communist
                            Bloc partners, principally Moscow and Peiping, for support in virtually
                            every sector of the economy. This dependency limits to a considerable
                            extent Hanoi’s power of decision over the pace and nature of its own
                            economic development.</p>
                        <p>3. Hanoi’s leaders would like to see Vietnamese hegemony extended over
                            all the states of former French Indochina. For the moment, their
                            ambition appears to be focused primarily on taking over South Vietnam.
                            Hanoi must move with circumspection in this effort, exercising care to
                            consider the views of its senior Communist allies, Moscow and Peiping,
                            and remaining alert to the danger of situations which might lead to
                            drastic US action. This fear of a major military confrontation with the
                            US places an upper limit on the scale and tempo of Hanoi’s militancy in
                            South Vietnam and Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>4. Another basic factor shaping North Vietnamese conduct is the desire to
                            retain a maximum amount of independence within the general framework of
                            the Communist movement. Like Yugoslavia and Communist China, the North
                            Vietnamese Communists came to power through a hard-won victory by their
                            own forces, and in <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>
                            they have a respected revolutionary leader and national founder in the
                            mold of Tito and Mao. Hanoi has the self-confidence which comes with
                            this heritage. Long oppressed by imperial China, the Vietnamese remain
                            fearful of and resistant to renewed domination by the Chinese, or, for
                            that matter, domination by any other alien power. So far Hanoi has
                            maintained a degree of autonomy that is uncommon in the Communist Bloc.
                            It has accepted aid from both Moscow and Peiping, and it has prevented
                            either from assuming a preponderant influence in its affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">II. North Vietnam’s Position in the
                                Sino-Soviet Dispute</hi></p>
                        <p>5. North Vietnam’s jealousy of its independence and its desire for
                            support from both Moscow and Peiping have been the primary determinants
                            of Hanoi’s position in the Sino-Soviet dispute. Hanoi desires the
                            military and political backing of as powerful a coalition as possible
                            and is shaken by the prospect of a split or disintegration of the
                            Communist Bloc. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> feels that the
                            political support and military backing of both Communist China and the
                            Soviet Union are essential to the maintenance of its integrity and as
                            strategic supports for its foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>6. Accordingly, the North Vietnamese have avoided taking a clear-cut
                            stand in favor of either party and have continually worked to bring the
                            two together. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> pursued
                            the role of mediator, with at least superficial success, at the 1960
                            all-party conclave in Moscow, and has persisted in his efforts to heal
                            the breach. Ho’s skill and his prestige as a senior Communist statesman,
                            an associate of both Lenin and Stalin, has contributed to North
                            Vietnam’s ability to avoid committing itself when all other Bloc parties
                            have done so.</p>
                        <p>7. There are longstanding rivalries and jealousies within the North
                            Vietnamese leadership, and factions have formed around various key
                            personages. However, the association of a leader or a faction with a
                            “pro-Moscow” or a “pro-Peiping” line is more likely to be based on
                            considerations of Vietnamese national interests than on a desire to
                            associate Hanoi with one side or the other in the Sino-Soviet
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>8. We believe that Hanoi’s self-interest will dictate a continuation of
                            this attitude for as long as possible. We must keep in mind, however,
                            that ardent Communist sectarians do not always follow the course which
                            seems to us clearly in their best interest. Peiping’s costly <pb n="419"
                                xml:id="pg_419" facs="0445"/>challenge to Moscow in 1960 is a case
                            in point. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Hanoi may
                            decide or be forced to come down off the fence.</p>
                        <p>9. Two contingencies would make such a development more likely. The death
                            of Ho would inaugurate a period of jockeying for power within the <gloss
                                target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> leadership and the impulses toward Bloc
                            unity and toward remaining aloof from the Sino-Soviet dispute would be
                            weakened. During this period also, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            actions toward Laos and South Vietnam might be less confident. A
                            definite break between Moscow and Peiping would lead both parties to be
                            more forthright and aggressive in seeking allies, and each would bring
                            increased pressure upon Hanoi to commit itself.</p>
                        <p>10. Although Hanoi deplores the Sino-Soviet polemic and seeks to mitigate
                            its bitterness, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> line on
                            particular substantive issues more frequently corresponds to the Chinese
                            than to the Soviet position. In general, Hanoi shares Peiping’s views on
                            how the world Communist movement should be run. Hanoi’s desire to
                            preserve its freedom of action leads it, like Peiping, to oppose
                            Moscow’s demand that the movement observe the principle of “democratic
                            centralism” (i.e., complete submission to the decisions of the majority,
                            which is controlled by Moscow). Hanoi’s irredentism toward South
                            Vietnam, like Peiping’s toward Taiwan, leads it to oppose devotion to
                            “peaceful coexistence” and to object to disarmament efforts except as a
                            device to “expose the insincerity of the imperialists.” Hanoi also joins
                            Peiping in supporting maximum “struggle” and support of “liberation”
                            movements. Cultural and racial affinities also incline the North
                            Vietnamese toward the Chinese rather than the Russians and the
                            overwhelming power of China is closer at hand. Hence, we believe that
                            Hanoi, if moved to take sides, would throw its support to the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>11. If this came to pass, Hanoi would have to face the possibility of a
                            curtailment or termination of Soviet economic and military support. But
                            unless the scope of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military moves
                            is considerably increased, Soviet military assistance is not vital.
                            Moreover, it seems likely that Hanoi, in conducting its operations at
                            current levels in Laos and South Vietnam, does not rely very heavily on
                            the Soviet deterrent. In the economic field, both Chinese and Soviet aid
                            programs are longterm,<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">A brief description

                                >DRV</gloss> development schemes, it would not be critical; much of
                            the slack would probably be taken up by expanded Chinese assistance and
                            by purchases in the Free World.</p>

                        <p>12. It should be emphasized, however, that support of Peiping on the
                            issues of the intra-Communist dispute does not automatically entail
                            either Hanoi’s subservience to Peiping or a definitive severing of
                            Hanoi’s ties to Moscow. There are a great variety of intermediate
                            stages, and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> would strive,
                            probably with considerable success, to retain a large measure of
                            independence and an effective connection with Moscow as well as with
                            Peiping.</p>

                                Dispute and Communist Policies and Action in Laos and South

                        <p>13. The primacy of Hanoi’s interest in Laos is almost certainly
                            recognized by Moscow and Peiping. However, both of them would exert
                            considerable pressure to prevent North Vietnamese actions which appeared
                            to imperil broader Chinese or Soviet interests. At present levels of
                            commitment and activity, Hanoi appears to have a relatively free hand
                            within Laos, where it exercises a high degree of control over the Pathet
                            Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>)—the Communist military force in
                            Laos—and its political counterpart, the Neo Lao Hak Xat (<gloss
                                target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>). Within the framework of political
                            and military objectives laid down by North Vietnam, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>
                            appears to exercise some degree of independent activity. Peiping appears
                            to have some direct contact with the <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                >PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>, though Moscow
                            does not.</p>
                        <p>14. In considering overall strategy in Laos, the Soviets almost certainly
                            see their interests as best served by a continuation of the political
                            “solution” achieved in the 1962 Geneva Conference on Laos; they probably
                            still expect that Communist objectives would be eventually achieved
                            almost wholly without risk, through penetration and subversion of
                            Premier Souvanna Phouma’s coalition government. The Soviets feel that
                            military pressures should be controlled so as to promote this aim.</p>
                        <p>15. For their part, Hanoi and Peiping almost certainly believe that a
                            Communist takeover can be accomplished more quickly and more directly.
                            Moreover, they may fear that the Soviet-preferred method would
                            significantly delay, and perhaps prevent, this achievement by allowing
                            the Souvanna regime to become stabilized and, given US assistance,
                            strengthened. In their view, the way to win is through constant
                            application of military and political pressure, capitalizing on quick,
                            limited military victories and eroding the enemy’s determination to
                            fight. Thus, the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese have acted to
                            debilitate the neutralists by all available means, but particularly by
                            limited military action to exploit Souvanna’s weakness and
                            indecisiveness.</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0447"/>
                        <p>16. In any event, Moscow, Peiping, and Hanoi almost certainly agree on
                            the classic principle of combining military and political action, with
                            the differences being a matter of degree and emphasis. Bloc policy in
                            Laos will almost certainly continue to reflect this overall Communist
                            strategy, with Hanoi’s choice of tactics dictated primarily by its
                            assessment of local developments rather than by considerations of the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute.</p>
                        <p>17. The Soviets will probably continue to compete with Peiping for the
                            allegiance of North Vietnam, and they almost certainly would prefer not
                            to give Hanoi and Peiping a free hand to decide Communist policy in
                            Laos. However, the Soviet Union’s interest in the Laos situation is
                            peripheral in contrast to its deep involvement in Cuba, Berlin, the
                            dispute with Peiping, and several other immediate issues. The Soviets
                            almost certainly prefer not to make much out of the Laos crisis and are
                            unlikely to do so unless the situation threatens to flare up and bring
                            the risk of an East-West confrontation there. On the other hand,
                            Communist China, bordering on Laos and loudly promoting the cause of
                            national liberation wars, is more directly involved. In the coming
                            months, as Moscow and Peiping approach another crisis in their
                            relations, the Chinese may try to make Laos an issue in the Sino-Soviet
                            dispute claiming that the Soviets are demonstrating an unwillingness to
                            support wars of national liberation in underdeveloped areas. But it
                            seems unlikely that Peiping would risk significantly escalating the
                            conflict in order to put the Soviets on the spot.</p>
                        <p>18. In any case, so long as Moscow and Peiping continue to compete for
                            the allegiance of Communists everywhere, we believe that Moscow will be
                            inhibited in opposing Hanoi’s and Peiping’s desires in Laos and South
                            Vietnam, unless these seem to be endangering Moscow’s own national
                            interests. A drastic change of the situation in Laos (e.g., the threat
                            of large-scale US intervention) might exacerbate Soviet-Chinese
                            differences over policies to be pursued in southeast Asia. However, in a
                            crisis showdown with the US, we cannot assume that Moscow would fail to
                            support Peiping and Hanoi.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Situation in South Vietnam</hi></p>
                        <p>19. Communist policy and action in South Vietnam appears to be almost
                            wholly dictated by Hanoi. As in Laos, Moscow and Peiping almost
                            certainly have a voice in policy decisions involving their support or
                            national interests, but, in general, both appear content to view the
                            “struggle” in the south as an irredentist issue and to permit the North
                            Vietnamese to pursue their subversive activity at a pace and in a manner
                            which Hanoi deems appropriate. Neither Moscow nor Peiping is known to
                            have any direct contact with either the Viet Cong or its <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0448"/>political mechanism, the National Front
                            for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NFLSV), although both, particularly
                            Peiping, have made much of visiting NFLSV delegations.</p>

                                now waging what it considers to be a war for survival with its
                                difficulties expanded by the deteriorating military situation in

                            Session with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            yesterday evening lasted over two and one-half hours. I believe that he
                            was reassured by reftel, of which I gave him text appropriate
                            paragraphs, and by my statement that we would be using first three

                            demarche and he parried all efforts to get him to speak frankly and
                            directly about his reactions to recent pressures or, indeed, to talk
                            about Buddhist problem at all, except in very superficial way. He did
                            not touch on any of actions and plans mentioned by <persName

                            there was nothing essentially new in any of this in terms of
                            information. What was remarkable was the stress he laid on his plans to
                            democratize the country from the bottom up and his very evident intent
                            to impress on me his solidarity with the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>s (I have never heard him refer to them so
                            frequently).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> spoke at length and with
                            passion and considerable eloquence about the fundamental social and
                            political revolution being carried out in Viet-Nam through the Strategic
                            Hamlet Program. The theme was essentially that of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> in fact specifically acknowledged this. Apart from
                            Strategic Hamlet Program itself, revolution depended upon two things.
                            First, development and instruction of youth, who must be infused with an
                            ideal and with ideas which would enable them to carry on meaningful
                            democratic process. For this, the instrument was Republican Youth led by
                            his brother. He spoke with emotion of courage and devotion these
                            “unpaid” youth had already shown in defending their hamlets, in aiding
                            fire victims, etc. Second essential was to carry out much the same
                            instruction and indoctrination of women “who make up more than half the
                            population”. Instrument here is Women’s Solidarity Movement led by
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. He <pb n="428"
                                xml:id="pg_428" facs="0454"/>acknowledged that this organization had
                            not made as much headway in provinces as Republican Youth and attributed
                            this in part to fact that Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> has not been able to travel widely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said that process he
                            described was moving very rapidly, that one could look forward to full
                            democracy and liberty in two or three years. At that point government
                            sponsored Republican Youth would give way to a mass political and social
                            organization entirely independent of government.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said government
                            was doing everything possible to stimulate democratic processes and
                            personal liberty. Hamlet elections had been successful and elections
                            would be extended rapidly upwards to province level. In Strategic Hamlet
                            and Republican Youth courses major effort was being made to encourage
                            free and critical discussion and airing of new ideas. On justice,
                            provinces had already been directed to institute as rapidly as possible,
                            and where security conditions permitted, a system of habeas corpus under
                            which no person could be held for longer than 24 hours without a court
                            order., (With only one judge for every three provinces, he said, this
                            was difficult to manage.) <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            again gave <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> much of credit for
                            this directive.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> spoke with great enthusiasm
                            about all this, remarking that Viet-Nam would soon be a model of
                            democracy for all of Southeast Asia. He also dropped a broad hint that
                            he and his Ministers could get job done faster if they could be
                            protected from outside pressures which took up so much of their time—a
                            clear reference to recent events.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: This is plainly some sort of response to

                            along (it is that all right), or whether it is a forecast of some new
                            and perhaps fairly spectacular steps along same lines.<note n="5"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said this morning that he

                            Republic of Vietnam have prompted us to review its aims and development
                            as well as assess its implications for future developments.</p>
                        <p rend="center">ABSTRACT</p>
                        <p>The basic purpose of the strategic hamlets is to achieve the widest
                            possible popular response to the government’s counterinsurgency effort
                            by (1) providing the peasant with an increasing degree of physical <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0461"/>security from Communist
                            intimidation and (2) enacting social, economic and political reforms
                            meaningful to the peasants. In addition to arming volunteer peasant
                            groups, elections, medical facilities, education, and social services
                            provide a community development program within the strategic hamlets
                            that may have favorable long-range social and political effects. Arising
                            out of local initiatives in 1961, the program received full central
                            government support in 1962 and has already proved effective in stemming
                            Communist successes, as evidenced by military actions on the ground as
                            well as Communist propaganda attacks, in Vietnam and abroad, against the
                            strategic hamlets. While the program has moved too rapidly for adequate
                            implementation in some areas, its general accomplishment to date has
                            been highly promising.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Aims and Objectives</hi></p>
                        <p>The basic purpose of the strategic hamlet program is to achieve the
                            widest possible popular response to the government’s counterinsurgency
                            effort by providing the peasants with an increasing degree of physical
                            security from Communist intimidation and by enacting social, economic,
                            and political reforms meaningful to the peasants in the context of their
                            own traditions and expectations. It should be noted that in a country
                            such as Vietnam, which has emerged only recently from almost a hundred
                            years of colonial rule and where popular concepts of government have
                            long been locally rather than nationally oriented, the very fact that a
                            national government would seek to serve and protect the citizenry might
                            itself be considered revolutionary.</p>
                        <p>The immediate security objectives of the program are two-fold—first, to
                            sever Communist communication and control lines to the rural populace
                            and thus deny the Communists the local resources (manpower, food,
                            intelligence, and weapons) necessary to their operations; and second, to
                            promote a nationwide self-defense effort at the rice-roots level by
                            providing the peasant with weapons and other defense facilities. The
                            immediate political objectives are to create the desire and will to
                            resist Communist blandishments and, at the same time, strengthen the
                            popular image of the government by providing the peasant with increased
                            social and economic benefits and by improving political and
                            administrative services in the hamlets.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these immediate objectives, the strategic hamlet program
                            may well have important implications for long-range social and political
                            development in Vietnam. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and other high government officials have repeatedly
                            stated that the strategic hamlet program will create a social, economic,
                            and political revolution in the countryside which will uproot vested
                            economic interests, implant lasting political democracy and efficient
                            and benevolent administration at the local level, and raise the peasant
                            to a new social status.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0462"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">What is the Strategic Hamlet?</hi></p>
                        <p>Although the village formally constitutes the lowest local administrative
                            unit in Vietnam, each village actually consists of several almost
                            self-sustaining settlements or hamlets of varying size, frequently
                            scattered over an appreciable distance. (There are some 2,500 villages
                            in Vietnam, while hamlets number about 14,000.) In an insurgency
                            situation, this distribution pattern very obviously poses major problems
                            for maintaining security and defense and would normally require an
                            extraordinarily large police, security, and military force merely to
                            maintain a presence, much less engage in effective operations. The
                            strategic hamlet approach, therefore, replaces the soldier or policeman
                            with the part-time “civilian volunteer,” or in the American tradition,
                            the “minuteman.”</p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet is essentially a fortified hamlet, as shown in
                            Attachment A, a sketch.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            Generally, only hamlets in relatively insecure areas or fairly close to
                            Communist strongholds are selected for fortification. Peasant huts
                            removed from the hamlet concentration pattern are brought closer to the
                            center of the pattern, thus limiting the, distance involved in the
                            regroupment. A fence of bamboo and barbed wire is built around the
                            entire hamlet, and a ditch or moat is dug around the fence; the ditch or
                            moat, in turn, is encircled by an earthen mound. The area immediately
                            around the village is cleared to permit fields of fire and to avoid
                            giving guerrillas and terrorists hiding places close to the hamlet.</p>
                        <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0463"/>
                        <p>Inside the strategic hamlet, there are one or more observation towers,
                            guardposts, and a defense post for storage of arms. An alarm system,
                            either of the most rudimentary type (a bell, gong, or bamboo drum) or of
                            field telephones, alerts the community to Communist attack. An
                            increasing number of strategic hamlets have also received small radio
                            sets which enable them to maintain direct communication with the
                            government administrative and military-security structure at the
                            district level, and ultimately with the central government complex m
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Defense is maintained largely by volunteers or recruits from the hamlet
                            population and frequently from among the youth. They are given arms and
                            trained in their use. The hamlet militia can also count on nearby units
                            of the regular security services, the Self Defense Corps and the Civil
                            Guard, and on the army for assistance in case of a major Communist
                            attack. Some of the strategic hamlets, because of their proximity to
                            Communist strongholds, are better fortified and frequently are referred
                            to as “defended” hamlets.</p>
                        <p>Inside the hamlets, the government has taken increasing measures to
                            improve the general lot of the peasant. It has established permanent
                            dispensaries or sent in medical teams, where once modern medical
                            attention was unknown; it has established or rebuilt schools, formerly
                            non-existent or destroyed by the Communists; it has built market places
                            where farmers can bring their produce in order to encourage business;
                            and new roads, wells, and a number of community development projects
                            have been started. Agricultural credit and fertilizer have been provided
                            to the farmer, and agricultural technicians have come to help the farmer
                            improve production. For example, loans by the National Agricultural
                            Credit Office to peasant farmers and repayments of these loans have
                            risen sharply since the beginning of 1963; farmers in strategic hamlets
                            have received more that 50% by value of these loans. In 10 central
                            provinces alone, the government is distributing more than 19,000 tons of
                            fertilizer which will be in time for this season’s planting.</p>
                        <p>On the political side, the government has drawn up “communal charters”
                            for the hamlets, legalized and developed a formal administrative
                            structure heretofore lacking or very rudimentary, and has accelerated a
                            training program for hamlet officials. Election of these officials by
                            secret ballot, provided by law, has actually begun in many provinces and
                            will be extended to all hamlets. These officials in turn vote for
                            village officials; village elections have also started and are expected
                            to take place in more than half of the 2,500 villages within the next
                            few months.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Origins and Development</hi></p>
                        <p>The strategic hamlet program in the Republic of Vietnam began during the
                            latter part of 1961. It grew out of a variety of security and political
                            measures adopted by local officials, acting to a considerable extent on
                            their own initiative to defend their areas from the growing Communist
                            campaign of guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and intimidation. The
                            government of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName>, recognizing the effectiveness of these scattered
                            efforts, responded quickly and threw its entire resources behind the
                            development of a national strategic hamlet program, drawing on its
                            knowledge of the Communist insurgencies in Malaya and Indochina and even
                            the Kibbutz program in Israel. In February 1962, a high level government
                            inter-agency committee was established to coordinate, direct, and
                            support the program on a national scale, and the following April, the
                            National Assembly passed a resolution declaring the strategic hamlet
                            program a national policy.</p>
                        <p>Before the end of 1962, the central government was providing funds,
                            administrative and technical skills, and material through the United
                            States assistance program for the construction of strategic hamlets.
                            Training programs were instituted for hamlet administrative and <pb

                            Considerable progress was made in regularizing the procedures for
                            implementing the hamlet program and in informing the public of its
                            objectives. The government promulgated a body of laws and regulations
                            which provide a legal basis for the administrative and governmental
                            organization and internal security of strategic hamlets. As the
                            construction of these hamlets progressed, the government proceeded to
                            implement a variety of economic, social, and political measures within
                            the hamlets, coordinating them with actual military operations against
                            the insurgents. What has since emerged is a nationally directed and
                            supported program, embodying a variety of military and non-military
                            concepts designed to meet the Communist threat at the rice-roots level.
                            Indeed, the strategic hamlet program is now the focal point of the
                            Vietnam Government’s comprehensive counterinsurgency effort.</p>
                        <p>Despite the national character of the strategic hamlet program, the
                            government continues to recognize that the effectiveness of the program
                            depends largely on local initiative and response. Since July 1962,
                            therefore, direct responsibility for planning and implementing the
                            strategic hamlet program has been placed officially in the hands of
                            local committees composed of civil and military officials and operating
                            within each of Vietnam’s 41 provinces. These committees draw up detailed
                            plans for strategic hamlets, and then submit them for approval by the
                            central government. Since the program is largely locally initiated and
                            directed, it does require local support contributions above those made
                            by the central government. The importance of the strategic hamlet
                            program is reflected in President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s reference to the program in his
                            state-of-the-union message to the National Assembly on October 1. 1962,
                            as shown below: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Communist reaction to the strategic hamlet program has been intense.
                            North Vietnam and its “National Front for the Liberation of South
                            Vietnam,” as well as Moscow and Peiping, have called strategic hamlets
                            “concentration camps” into which “people are forcibly herded.” North
                            Vietnamese propaganda has charged that the Vietnam <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0465"/>Government will “herd 14 million rural,
                            urban, and mountain people” into strategic hamlets which will be used
                            “to trample upon the life, customs, habits, democratic freedom, and the
                            most common sentiments and interest of human beings”—ultimately to
                            “annihilate” the Vietnamese people. Communist propaganda has blatantly
                            called upon the Vietnamese people not only to resist the program but
                            also to destroy hamlets wherever they exist.</p>
                        <p>On the ground, Communist guerrillas, terrorists, and agents are making a
                            major armed and subversive effort against strategic hamlets. Armed
                            attacks have risen sharply, but the percentage of their success has been
                            very small. Attempts to destroy or burn fences are frequent. Communist
                            agents use bribery, threats, and intimidation to gain entrance into the
                            hamlets and to keep peasants from participating or to entice them to
                            leave. Many local officials who refused to heed Communist threats have
                            been assassinated or kidnapped.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Critique</hi></p>
                        <p>It is still early to make definitive and detailed evaluations of the
                            strategic hamlet program. It must be remembered that it has been in
                            existence as a national program for just over one year. However
                            impressive the claim by the Vietnam Government that more than 5,000
                            strategic hamlets have been constructed, many problems have arisen
                            during this period requiring modification and readjustment in
                            procedures. The Vietnam Government has recognized that this is a bold
                            new effort and that mistakes will be made and has reacted quickly to
                            remedy and improve the situation. For example, the physical defenses of
                            strategic hamlets admittedly vary in quality and, in some cases, leave
                            much to be desired. Since many hamlets are still in the early stage of
                            development, defense and security measures as well as various political,
                            social, and economic projects are still somewhat deficient. Finally, a
                            program of this magnitude requires a large pool of administrative and
                            technical personnel and a considerable effort by the government to
                            educate and train such personnel in both the conceptual and practical
                            requirements of a revolutionary program.</p>
                        <p>On balance, however, the strategic hamlet has been a success. Much of the
                            concern and hesitation originally shown by the peasants has disappeared,
                            partly because of the Vietnam Government’s improved public information
                            program but also because of the security and other benefits the peasants
                            have received once they moved into the hamlets. The hamlet militia is
                            exhibiting both the desire and capability to fight, and there are
                            increasing reports of peasants volunteering intelligence on the
                            Communists and of welcoming the strategic hamlet program because it has
                            freed them from Communist intimidation and “taxation.” Commerce has been
                            considerably revived in the countryside, and there has even been a spurt
                            in the construction and reconstruction <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                                facs="0466"/>of dwellings. More than one hundred thousand
                            Montagnards or tribesmen have voluntarily left the Communist-controlled
                            mountain areas in large groups and have asked for asylum in strategic
                            hamlets. Finally, the strategic hamlet program has already reduced the
                            total area and population under Communist control or influence and has
                            weakened Communist strength and logistics capabilities. Communist
                            guerrillas are reportedly experiencing morale problems and shortages of
                            food and supplies in many areas, and have resorted increasingly to
                            outright theft and harassment of the peasant in order to gain supplies
                            and recruits. These tactics will only serve to decrease still further
                            the Communist base of operations.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion that the strategic hamlet program has been successful is
                            further supported by the very efforts the Communists are making to
                            subvert it. Intelligence reports clearly indicate that the Communist
                            insurgents regard the program as constituting one of the most serious
                            threats to their continued operations and are now attempting to develop
                            a strategy of their own to counter the strategic hamlet. The Communist
                            propaganda line that the hamlets are “concentration camps” is obviously
                            part of this strategy. Of course, the Communists fail to note that the
                            “internees” are provided weapons. Admittedly, bamboo and barbed wire
                            fences exist, but these are to keep Communist guerrillas and terrorists
                            out rather than the villagers in. Identity cards have been issued to
                            hamlet inhabitants, but these are to identify Communist agents rather
                            than to control the peasants. There is thus a degree of regimentation,
                            but the Vietnam Government is faced with a grim, prolonged war. Thus
                            some form of regimentation is unavoidable and indeed desirable.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Strategic Hamlet: Citadel or
                                Concentration Camp?</hi></p>
                        <p>Communist charges from Moscow, Peiping, and Hanoi to the effect that
                            strategic hamlets are “concentration camps” ignore one basic fact: the
                            residents are armed. The barbed wire, bamboo spike barricades, and watch
                            towers protect the hamlet and are manned by peasants. The immediate
                            purpose of the strategic hamlet is to permit the peasant to protect
                            himself. This purpose is already achieved throughout much of the
                            countryside. Communist intimidation and recruitment of guerrillas
                            through terrorization cannot succeed where effective strategic hamlets
                            exist. Communist attempts to seize local food supplies fail when
                            volunteer militia can provide a prompt and organized response.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this minimum purpose of security, however, the strategic hamlets
                            have a much more fundamental and important purpose. They represent an
                            experiment in community self-development on a nationwide basis,
                            unprecedented in Vietnamese rural life. Local initiative and local
                            choice prevails but with provincial and central government support. <pb
                                n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0467"/>Medical and educational
                            services advance under the direction of locally elected officials, with
                            funds and teams provided by higher levels of government. Agricultural
                            credits and technical services, particularly in fertilizer distribution,
                            give outside assistance to the isolated and scattered hamlets. Over
                            time, these measures should provide a greater sense of loyalty and
                            positive identification between countryside and capital, as well as
                            substantive improvements in local well-being.</p>
                        <p>Open to any visitor from any country at any time, and under constant
                            review, the strategic hamlet program in Vietnam is moving from infancy
                            to solid growth in a relatively short time and against determined
                            Communist opposition. As the opposition is defeated, the negative
                            aspects, manifested in regimentation and military defenses, should give
                            way to increasing freedom and self-rule. This can lay the foundation for
                            new political relationships in Vietnam extending from peasant to
                            presidency. Whether, indeed, this will happen depends largely upon the
                            environment within which the strategic hamlet program develops, not only
                            in Vietnam but throughout the entire Indochina peninsula.</p>

                            said <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not unless “you
                            told him so yourself”. I asked for his suggestions as to what to do now,
                            but he had none. I left with distinct impression that <persName

                            promptly settle with Buddhists on five demands. Now he would be told
                            that we may have to make public statement if in effect <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does not make forthright effort to

                        <p>I am confident that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has
                            already calculated that we may make public statement, and on basis
                            present evidence he may well have discounted possibility.</p>
                        <p>I realize this is optional part of demarche but, without this threat,
                            rest of demarche would, I believe, be sterile; it would irritate him to

                        <p>I appreciate fully problems involved in making definite threat to
                            dissociate ourselves if there is further bloodshed or

                            that, without such a threat, demarche to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                            to make him relax than to move. I would therefore appreciate
                            reconsideration of instructions.</p>

                        <p>24. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for <gloss
                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. I saw President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> at 5:45 PM. I thanked him for
                            receiving me promptly, and said that I was sorry to interrupt his busy
                            schedule but the matter was important and, in our view, urgent.</p>
                        <p>I then gave him my letter (<gloss target="#t_EMBTEL1">Embtel</gloss>
                                18).<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2"><ref target="#d201">Document
                                    201</ref>.</note> After he had read it, I said that if he were
                            disposed to make an address, we were prepared to offer some suggestions
                            as to its content. He replied with marked politeness that he would be
                            glad to consider any ideas we might have. I then outlined for him the
                            main points in a paper<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">No copy of this paper
                                has been found.</note> which I subsequently left with him,
                            emphasizing that we attach particular importance to his inviting
                            Buddhist leaders to meet with him personally as a matter of urgency. He
                            read over the list, put it to one side, and said that he would consider
                            it, along with the letter, and his “collaborators”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> then talked briefly and in
                            general terms about difficulties of Buddhist problem, giving no hint of
                            what if any action he has in mind. He spoke of difficulties of meeting
                            demands which might in themselves be reasonable but would encourage
                            further demands which government could not meet. He referred to inherent
                            complexity of some of the problems, notably questions relating to
                            ownership of property. He mentioned also, in surprisingly good natured
                            way, that some of Buddhist leaders had political motives and used unfair
                            tactics.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought we could grant all these things and that we understood
                            very well that there were real risks in whatever course he took. Had not
                            the time arrived, however, for him to take matters into his own hands? I
                            was afraid that the letters being exchanged between Vice President and
                            Buddhists were simply piling up charges and counter-charges and, if
                            anything, making a solution more difficult. What was needed was for
                            President personally to take actions which would firmly establish good
                            faith of government and leave isolated those who still cavilled.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not react.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I hoped in any case he understood gravity of situation
                            from standpoint of U.S. He replied to effect that he understood we had a
                            problem with public opinion. This arose, he felt, largely from news and
                            information which was not strictly accurate and often exaggerated. U.S.
                            Government should set record straight. I said that before we could set
                            record straight we had to have further action <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0472"/>by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            on which to base ourselves. In this connection, I said, I could bring
                            up, as I had been instructed to do, <hi rend="italic">Times of
                                Vietnam</hi> article.<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d196fn2">footnote 2, Document 196</ref>.</note> I told
                            him I had been instructed to talk to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> also about this article and, as he said he had not
                            seen it, I described main offensive features and gave him a copy of the
                            newspaper. I told him with some (very genuine) feeling that unless such
                            statements stopped no settlement was possible, in view of my government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> limited himself to
                            saying that he would study the article. He then brought interview to a
                            close ushering me out with great, but perhaps forced, politeness.</p>
                        <p>Whole meeting lasted less than half an hour, which may be a new
                            record.</p>

                        <p>I have been instructed to see Your Excellency once again on the Buddhist
                            problem, primarily to make certain that you understand clearly the
                            position in which the United States Government finds itself.</p>
                        <p>Liberal and press opinion in the United States is increasingly, and now
                            almost unanimously, critical of the religious situation in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>There are now indications also that the matter may be brought up in the
                            United Nations. In that forum the United States, as the chief supporter
                            of Viet-Nam, would face a difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Justly or unjustly, this is the situation which the United States
                            Government is facing vis-à-vis domestic and international opinion.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, religious toleration is one of the most basic tenets of
                            American civilization. The United States Government does not believe
                            that the Government of Viet-Nam has gone far enough to convince and
                            explain to its people the basic importance which it attaches <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0473"/>to religious tolerance and national
                            unity. It considers that the present state of mistrust in Viet-Nam
                            requires a public statement from Your Excellency designed to bridge the
                            gap of understanding.</p>
                        <p>Such a statement should, in our view, be made very soon, before there is
                            another Buddhist incident. If an incident should nevertheless occur, the
                            Government of Viet-Nam and the United States would be in a position to
                            point to your statement as evidence of the good faith of the Government
                            of Viet-Nam in trying to convince the Buddhists of a genuine desire to
                            reach an understanding.</p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, another incident occurs and Your Excellency has
                            not made a conciliatory statement, then my government believes that the
                            situation in Viet-Nam would soon get out of control. The United States
                            Government would also have to make its own position perfectly clear.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. President, the renewed assurances of my highest
                            consideration.</p>

                        <p>The two-week truce between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            the Buddhists signed on June 16th ended yesterday. We have received
                            various reports from Buddhist circles that they are not satisfied with
                            the manner in which the Government is implementing the agreement,
                            particularly with respect to the release of prisoners, instructions to
                            the province chiefs and rumors which have reached Buddhist ears that the
                            Government does not intend to carry out the agreement in good faith. We
                            have also received reports of coup plotting among the Buddhists and
                            threats to resume demonstrations and incidents of self-destruction.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0474"/>
                        <p>On the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> side, we have fairly reliable
                            information that Brother <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has
                            been actively working to stir up phony popular demand that the truce
                            agreement be disavowed by the Government, using his Republican Youth
                            organization for this purpose. After a meeting of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s family in Hue, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Times of Vietnam</hi>, a government-sponsored
                            newspaper, came out on July 1 with a provocative article daring the
                            Buddhist to resume demonstrations.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">See <ref

                        <p>These events, plus increasing recalcitrance on <persName

                            the point where communication with him has become difficult, has led us
                            to believe that the situation is now more serious than ever. It is
                            entirely possible that there will be a resumption of demonstrations,
                            including self-immolations; and the incentive for organized plots
                            against the regime is getting very high.</p>
                        <p>We have given Bill <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>, our

                            we would expect further demonstrations in Saigon and would then be
                            forced to make a strong statement disassociating the United States from

                            comment in the face of another bonze suicide, and that therefore we
                            should leave no stone unturned to persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> to change his attitude. Everyone recognizes that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s position in South
                            Vietnam has now become as critical as it has ever been, and that the
                            United States may have to grope its way through governmental upheaval in
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> is being asked

                            to require that he leave earlier. We are considering asking Secretary

                            scheduled departure for Saigon from September to August. We may need
                            your help in this respect. In the meantime, Bill <persName

                                Nolting</persName> to go back early is the inappropriateness of

                            event of a coup. At present our best hope in the event of an accident is
                            to have the Vice President succeed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                            <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> called me in this morning
                            for specific purpose of asking me to transmit his personal
                            recommendation that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> return to Saigon as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>He said that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had shown him
                                letter<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3"><ref target="#d201">Document

                            him yesterday, but had given him absolutely no idea of what action he
                            proposed to take. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> had
                            nevertheless concluded that he was probably going to do nothing. This
                            view was reinforced when I told him something of yesterday’s
                            conversation, particularly <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                            >Diem</persName>’s rather excessive politeness. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said “I would rather have him
                            get red in the face and pound the table; after he cools down he may
                            accept. The least encouraging posture is polite immovability.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> continued that both he and
                            I had used all our ammunition. He still agreed on our assessment of
                            situation and that we were “running a race with the bonzes”. He would
                            continue to try to bring home to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> the need to act, but he was plainly not
                            hopeful.</p>
                        <p>Only thing he saw to do was to have Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> return. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> attached great importance to
                            personal friendship and was “sentimental.” <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> might be able to move him, not only because of
                            personal relationship, but also owing to fact that his position would be
                                <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0476"/>“detached” as result early
                            departure from Vietnam. I pointed out latter would normally be
                            considered disadvantage, but <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> insisted it would be asset.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> had any
                            views as to what Ambassador should do when he got here, pointing out he
                            was likely to have same instructions as I had, if not stronger.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said he had no
                            suggestions; he was relying wholly on personal relationship and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>’s “detachment” to
                            get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to move.</p>
                        <p>I questioned <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> very closely
                            as to whether this was his idea or <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s. He insisted it was his own and asked that I

                        <p>The President was briefed on developments in Indonesia, Laos and
                            Viet-Nam. The portion on Viet-Nam follows:</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0478"/>
                        <p>A joint agreement was signed on June 16 in which the Government met the
                            Buddhists’ five demands. The Buddhists and the Government then worked
                            together on the funeral arrangements for the bonze who burned himself to
                            death so that incidents could be avoided. The funeral came off without
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>Since then there have been rumors circulating in Saigon that the
                            Government does not intend to live up to the agreement. These rumors
                            were given credence by an article appearing in the English language <hi
                                rend="italic">“Times” of Viet-Nam</hi>,<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d196fn2">footnote 2, Document 196</ref>.</note>
                            which is dominated by the Nhus. The article contained a veiled attack on
                            the US and on the Buddhists. There was a suggestion that the Monk who
                            burned himself to death was drugged and a provocative challenge to the
                            Buddhists that, if no further demonstrations occurred on July 2, this
                            would amount to an admission by the Buddhists that they were satisfied
                            with the Government’s action. (The President injected questions on the
                            possibility of drugging, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> replied that religious fervor was an adequate
                            explanation.)</p>
                        <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>At this point there was a discussion of the possibility of getting rid of
                            the Nhus in which the combined judgment was that it would not be
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Continuing the briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> said that the Buddhists contained an activist
                            element which undoubtedly favored increasing demands as well as charging
                            the Government with dragging its feet. There was thus an element of
                            truth in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s view that the
                            Buddhists might push their demands so far as to make his fall
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p>During these events the US had put extremely heavy pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to take political actions. Most
                            recently we had urged <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to
                            make a speech which would include announcements that he intended to meet
                            with Buddhist leaders, permit Buddhist chaplains in the army and so on.
                            If <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did not make such a
                            speech and there were further demonstrations, the US would be compelled
                            publicly to disassociate itself from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>’s Buddhist policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> had received this approach with what seemed to be
                            excessive politeness but had said he would consider making such a
                            speech.</p>
                        <p>Our estimate was that no matter what <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> did there will be coup attempts over the next four
                            months. Whether or not any of these attempts will be successful is
                            impossible to say.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> said that everyone
                            agreed that the chances of chaos in the wake of a coup are considerably
                            less than they were a year ago. An encouraging sign relative to this
                            point is that the war between the Vietnamese forces and the Viet Cong
                            has been pursued throughout the Buddhist crisis without noticeable
                            let-up.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>
                            reported on General <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName>’s
                            views that, even if there were chaos in Saigon, the military units in
                            the field would continue to confront the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> went on to say that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> believes that
                            the most likely result of a coup attempt that succeeded in killing
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was civil war. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> disagreed with this
                            view slightly in that he thought civil war was not the most likely
                            result but that it was certainly a possible result.</p>
                        <p>The timing of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                            >Nolting</persName>’s return and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName>’s assumption of duty was then discussed. The
                            President’s initial view was that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> should return immediately and
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should
                            assume his duties as soon thereafter as possible. The President
                            volunteered that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> had done an outstanding job, that it was almost
                            miraculous the way he had succeeded in turning the war around from the
                            disastrously low point in relations between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and ourselves that existed when Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> took over. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> pointed out the
                            personal sacrifices that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> had been forced to make during this period, and
                            the President said that he hoped a way could be found to commend
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> publicly so
                            as to make clear the fine job he had done and that he hoped an
                            appropriate position could be found for him in Washington so that he
                            could give his children a suitable home in the years immediately
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>The President’s decision was to delegate the authority to decide on the
                            timing of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>’s
                            return to the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs; that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> should report
                            to Washington no later than July 15 so that he could take the
                            Counterinsurgency Course simultaneously with the normal briefings for an
                            ambassador, and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> should arrive in Saigon as soon as possible
                            following completion of the <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> Course on
                            August 14. Arrangements were made for Ambassador <persName

                        <p>I wish to call your attention to the situation in Laos and its relation
                            to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>Very substantial Viet Minh units are now in Laos, positioned to protect
                            the infiltration corridor to South Vietnam. We now also have, for the
                            first time, firm evidence, capable of diplomatic and public
                            presentation, that the Viet Minh have violated the Geneva Accord of 1962
                            by introducing men (trained political agents) through Laos into South
                            Vietnam after the October deadline.</p>
                        <p>Although equivalent, firm surfaceable evidence does not yet exist on
                            military units, no one believes that such infiltration has been reduced
                            since October 1962. It may run at a rate of 4-500 per month. To judge
                            the burden imposed on the war effort in South Vietnam one must multiply
                            this figure by about 15. It is evidently Ho’s policy to sop up the
                            improved performance in South Vietnam by this cheap device awaiting
                            either a break on the political situation in Saigon or US discouragement
                            with our effort there. South Vietnam has always been Ho’s primary
                            immediate objective in Laos rather than the control of the Mekong
                            Valley.</p>
                        <p>It is evidently bad practice to connive at the violation of a solemn
                            agreement by the Communists. I believe the time has come to call them on
                            this; and the appropriate occasion is the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                >Harriman</persName> mission, since he negotiated for us at Geneva
                            and personally received the Pushkin assurances that Moscow would assume
                            responsibility for stopping the use of Laos as an infiltration route
                            into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>Both on principle and in terms of American politics I believe it would be
                            unwise for us to permit a mood of detente to develop with Moscow until
                            this matter is settled. American soldiers are committed in substantial
                            numbers in South Vietnam and we are taking casualties.</p>
                        <p>(Incidentally, I would say the same about the continued presence of
                            Soviet forces in Cuba. A detente will haunt us until the Soviet forces
                            are substantially removed from Cuba.)</p>
                        <p>I propose, therefore, that Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"

                        <p>I would only add this: if we are to have a showdown with Ho (and,
                            implicitly, Mao) on this matter, we should bring it about before the
                            Chinese Communists blow a nuclear device. Such a symbolic capability
                            would not alter the basic military equation in the Far East, but it
                            could complicate the task of holding our alliances firm in the face of
                            US action, introducing elements of a nuclear confrontation not now
                            present.</p>

                        <p>The constantly repeated assertion, heard over the past year and a half,
                            that the strategic hamlet is the heart of the counterinsurgency
                            strategy, is acquiring growing validation. Binh Duong Province-one in
                            which province rehabilitation has lagged because of much hard core Viet
                            Cong activity was first selected for a physical inspection. This is the
                            province in which President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                            >Diem</persName>, against the counsel of others, launched the Sunrise
                            strategic hamlet operation in 1962, at a time when the bulk of the
                            population in the area was under Viet Cong control.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary of Defense visited the Sunrise project in May of 1962,
                            and despite the Vietnamese effort to conceal the fact, it was plainly
                            far from a success. The only strategic hamlet in the province, its
                            organization did not really extend far beyond a system of strong
                            physical defenses. The inhabitants were there under duress. Combat
                            capable men were conspicuous by their absence.</p>
                        <p>Fourteen months have seen a great change. There are now 92 strategic
                            hamlets completed in the province, out of a programmed total of 302.
                            Many have been carved out of areas wholly dominated by the Viet Cong for
                            ten years or more. These, moreover, are now more than barbed wire
                            enclosures into which women, children and aged men have been herded
                            against their will, as was the case in Sunrise. The people have come
                            willingly—in some cases having actually sent deputations to request the
                            development of a hamlet. Economic and political developments have moved
                            ahead in train with the defensive preparations. Two new hamlets
                            visited—Bung Dia and Cau Dinh—had programs underway for pig raising,
                            seed and fertilizer distribution, fruit tree planting, well digging and
                            education. The people, unprepared for the visit, seemed enthusiastic.
                            The hamlet chiefs had both been elected by the villagers. Neither had
                            ever held any office before; both had just completed a province-run
                            course in hamlet administration. These hamlets were impressive in every
                            sense.</p>
                        <p>In Quang Ngai Province, also visited because of its long history of heavy
                            Viet Cong infestation, progress was equally impressive. A year ago the
                            province had no strategic hamlets deserving of the name. Today there are
                            273 completed and 125 more under construction, out of a total program of
                            419. Over two thirds of the people in the province are in hamlets, and
                            the entire program is scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
                            Here, as in Binh Duong Province, the people and the land have had to be
                            wrested from the Viet Cong. The hamlet of Vinh Tuy, one of those visited
                            in this province, rests on ground which only fell to Vietnamese forces
                            after three attacks, in February of this year. It is still pretty crude,
                            but the people in it, who <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0484"/>were
                            actually under Viet Cong control six months ago, seemed cheerful and
                            busy. Most important, there was a reasonable percentage of young men of
                            military age in evidence.</p>
                        <p>For contrast, a visit was also paid to Ninh <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> Province, one of the two in which the strategic
                            hamlet program is already fully completed. Here, 127 hamlets are in
                            being, housing 97% of the people of the province. The hamlets differ
                            greatly in quality and in physical character, being designed to suit the
                            peculiarities of the varied population—which includes Vietnamese, Cham
                            tribesmen and Montagnards. In several respects, however, they are
                            similar. The all reflect a unified effort at training and equipping a
                            hamlet militia contingent. They all are active in the radio warning
                            system; and they all exhibit progress in the US/Vietnamese economic
                            assistance program.</p>
                        <p>In fact, this province finds its problems now largely shifted from
                            military matters to economic development. The area is tranquil-will
                            probably soon be declared officially “white”. There are no regular
                            military forces remaining in the province and the peoples’ concerns have
                            now turned from the Viet Cong to an ambitious irrigation program and the
                            development of rural power. The province, hopefully, is a foretaste of
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the visit to the central and northern parts of the country
                            progress was noted in bringing together the US military and economic
                            assistance programs. Every major military briefing attended in these
                            regions included a presentation by a civilian member of the US Overseas
                            Mission, and every discussion on strategic hamlets dwelt upon the
                            indissoluble nature of our military/economic programs. This coordinated
                            approach may have been in effect 15 months ago. If so, it was not nearly
                            so obvious as today.</p>
                        <p>In the Delta, this degree of coordinated progress apparently has not yet
                            been achieved. In Vinh Long Province, although the hamlet program is
                            well along (206 out of 247) our economic participation is less in
                            evidence. This may derive from the fact that there is not so much
                            poverty in the Delta, or because the premium on security is still much
                            greater than on economic improvement.</p>

                            July, was actually in progress before that date. Over 1,000 assorted
                            offensive operations are now conducted per month, over twice the level
                            of a year ago. Not all are effectively executed, nor are all successful.
                            In sum, however, they are putting great pressure on the Viet Cong,
                            causing him casualties, degrading his resources and keeping him on the

                                    exactly one year. During that period it has succeeded in driving
                                    the Viet Cong from the coastal plain into the mountains of the
                                    Annamite Chain, where they are now largely on the defensive. At
                                    the time of this visit all three regiments of the division were
                                    in the field, and some 50 small ambush type patrols were in
                                    progress. This effort has made the Viet Cong’s food problem a
                                    grave one, has rendered the kidnapping of conscripts most
                                    difficult, is the cause of continued defections, and diminishes
                                    the enemy’s capacity for coordinated offensive operations.</p>
                                <p>The division commander has the taste of blood and is convinced
                                    that he can destroy the Viet Cong forces in his province—or
                                    drive them elsewhere—by the end of the year.</p>

                                    campaign. At the time it was visited the division had two
                                    battalions, broken down into their small component units,
                                    patrolling in the mountainous area in the western part of the
                                    province. They had been continuously at this task for the
                                    preceding 26 days, concentrating on harrying the Viet Cong,
                                    making him move and destroying his resources. It is a well
                                    conceived and fruitfully executed effort. In the 26 day period
                                    they had seized sizeable grain stocks (120 tons), destroyed
                                    crops, bivouac areas and crude weapons shops. They had freed 293
                                    persons from Viet Cong control-people who have hitherto been
                                    terrorized into tilling the Viet Cong fields and bearing their
                                    loads.</p>
                                <p>In all of this, only 26 Viet Cong had so far been killed and six
                                    captured, which seems somewhat disappointing until it is
                                    recalled that the total number of Viet Cong involved is probably
                                    small, and the task of bringing them to bay in the mountains
                                    very difficult. More important, by far, is that patrol and
                                    attack efforts of this type deprive the Viet Cong of his
                                    initiative. So long as he is on the defensive, it is plain that
                                    he cannot attack anyone.</p>

                                Cong territory adjacent to Zone D was a disappointment. By moving
                                into the Viet Cong enclave, the unit struck a raw nerve. It was
                                taking casualties from both mines and snipers, yet little was being
                                done to develop the situation aggressively. At three o'clock on a
                                bright afternoon the troops were already beginning to settle down
                                for the evening, with the soldiers keeping very near to their
                                vehicles-which they clearly regarded more as mobile redoubts than
                                offensive conveyances Despite the demonstrated proximity of the
                                enemy, there were no patrols; no aggressive activity. It will be
                                remarkable if much comes of the operation, other than casualties.
                                The unit commander (a captain) and his US advisor (a captain) had
                                little to say, when questioned, beyond frustrated observations on

                        <p>The Buddhist matter seems to break cleanly into two separate problems—the
                            question of the metropolitan political maneuverings in Saigon, Hue, etc.
                            and the influence of the Buddhist issue on the actual counterinsurgency
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>This being essentially a military report, it will be pertinent, in
                            connection with the first element, to state only that the issue is
                            serving as nourishment for all varieties of dissidents, malcontents,
                            king makers and coup plotters, and that some of the most articulate
                            Buddhist Bonzes are probably motivated more by politics than by
                            religious conviction. On this basis it is not likely that the problem
                            will be allowed to reach an early or an agreeable end. The anti-Diemists
                            will not relinquish lightly this Buddha-sent opportunity to attack
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s position.</p>
                        <p>As to whether the affair has affected the war itself, Americans and
                            Vietnamese of all stations were queried, and the nearer to the battle,
                            the less gravely the problem was regarded. There appeared no evidence
                            that the front line counterinsurgency effort has yet been impeded or
                            decelerated at all by the crisis.</p>
                        <p>In Quang Ngai, for instance, the Province Chief-himself a
                            Catholic-handled a group of demonstrators in the capital by inviting
                            them to a free meal. The demonstration collapsed. In Binh Dinh, the
                            commander of the 9th Division (a Buddhist) characterized the problem as
                            regrettable, but one which time would solve.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, several Americans stated that this attitude of
                            detachment in the field could not persist indefinitely; that sooner or
                            later, if the matter is not resolved, the mid-rank military of Buddhist
                            persuasion will begin to worry as to just what they would do if their
                            unit were told to take military action against Buddhist
                            demonstrators.</p>

                        <p>A significant point in this unfortunate matter is that the religious
                            aspect of the issue has a narrower base than public reports might
                            suggest, since the true percentage of practicing Buddhists is smaller
                            than generally represented. These is a tendency to classify all
                            non-Christians as Buddhists. IN fact, many are simple ancestor
                            worshippers in the Chinese tradition, while other major religions are
                            also represented in the country—including Confucianists, Taoists and
                            Moslems. Finally, there 7,000,000 Montagnards, of whom many are
                            animists.</p>

                        <p>First thoughts on the amnesty program are usually, “Can the Vietnamese
                            really distinguish between simple refugees and genuine returning Viet
                            Cong Sympathizers?” and “What assurance is there that the returnees will
                            not re-defect to the Communists?”</p>
                        <p>A hint of an answer was found at the Chieu Hoi reindoctrination camp at
                            Than Xa, Quang Ngai Province, where 115 returnees were observed
                            undergoing reindoctrination.</p>
                        <p>The group was mostly men. They had come in voluntarily; some bringing
                            weapons; all bringing intelligence which ultimately they transmitted to
                            our side.</p>
                        <p>About a quarter were hard core Viet Cong. Another quarter were political
                            cadre. The remainder were people who willingly followed the Viet Cong
                            when the hamlet program and widespread military attacks caused the Viet
                            Cong to retire westward from the plains to the mountains.</p>
                        <p>Most of this group were described by the US Sector Advisor as politically
                            astute. They show evidence of having had careful Communist
                            indoctrination. Some are sufficiently articulate to confirm that they
                            were political instructors themselves. There seemed little reason to
                            doubt the word of the Province Chief when he said that these were truly
                            Viet Cong sympathizers and not refugees.</p>
                        <p>There are many reasons given for accepting the amnesty offer (usually
                            received through leaflets), but they are generally polarized around one
                            abstract attitude—disillusionment, and one concrete reality—hunger. In
                            the north, hunger probably leads all the rest, although this is not true
                            in the more fruitful south. Every one of the returnees queried during
                            the visit to the Quang Ngai center got around to talking about food very
                            quickly. They looked hungry, and are in poor physical shape.</p>
                        <p>It is too early to address the second question—whether the returnees will
                            redefect. When asked this question, the tactical zone commander
                            responded in this fashion. The program in Quang Ngai was <pb n="462"
                                xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>begun on 17 December 1962. Since that
                            time 823 people have passed through the rehabilitation center and thence
                            returned to their own villages. A check is kept on all of them; none
                            have yet gone back to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The total number of “Open Arms” returnees—country wide, stands at 11,700.
                            While more surrendered in June than in the preceding two months put
                            together, it is not likely that there will be any vast domino effect.
                            The base is too small. Over 60% of the population are already in
                            strategic hamlets. In a few months the figure will be much higher. So
                            there will actually not be a very great number of people available for
                            the amnesty program to attract.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, those who have rallied to the government have already cut
                            in to the Viet Cong logistic support structure, in areas where it badly
                            hurts—food production, porterage and probably most important, native
                            intelligence.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The US Advisory Presence</hi></p>
                        <p>Forty-eight US advisors, from the Saigon level to enlisted men with
                            tactical units, were asked to comment on the US/Vietnamese relationship.
                            Their answers were singularly similar: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“There may be troubles, in this regard, elsewhere; but I have
                                    never had any difficulty at all.”</p>
                                <p>“My counterpart wants me here, and says so often. He takes my
                                    advice.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>“We have had our disagreements as to ways and means. Sometimes it takes a
                            week for my advice to sink in; but we have come to understand one
                            another.”</p>
                        <p>Of the forty-eight, none could recall any change in attitude since the
                            subject was raised by Counsellor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> two months ago. Several have discussed it candidly
                            with their Vietnamese counterparts. Among these, the general reaction
                            obtained seems to be that the attitude of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is remote from the realities of the
                            war. Apart from this, the warm and respectful advisor/advisee
                            relationship is quite evident. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName>, in this regard, lays the bulk of the
                            trouble-making proclivity at <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> door; considers <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> not to be an active participant.</p>
                        <p>One point noted frequently by the US advisors relates to language. The
                            more senior Vietnamese commanders speak French, and some have fair
                            English. The junior ones speak only Vietnamese, and struggle with
                            English. Thus, ideally, they point out that we should send senior
                            advisors with skill in French, while the lower ranking advisory
                            personnel should have a basic grounding in Vietnamese before they
                            come.</p>
                        <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0489"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Laos</hi></p>
                        <p>It is not difficult to synthesize the views of US/Vietnamese officialdom
                            in Vietnam on the matter of Laos. They are all agreed on one point’
                            there is a direct and pressing relationship between affairs in the two
                            countries and the worse things go in Laos, the more difficult matters
                            will be in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Their viewpoints differ only as to degree. The Saigon <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representative is unequivocal in his
                            conviction that if Laos falls to the Communists the loss of Vietnam must
                            inevitably follow. General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> believes that the loss of Laos would render our
                            problem in Vietnam more difficult, but that it would not make a
                            favorable conclusion impossible.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Vietnamese commanders at all levels speak with feeling of the
                            flow of warlike essentials and key personnel into their country via the
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail. While
                            generally unable to produce abundant hard evidence of the fact, they
                            still, in recounting their day to day combat experiences, underscore
                            that external influence on the battle—actual and potential—must form a
                            part of every calculation. Certainly, the material flow could be greatly
                            increased, should the Communists choose to do so, particularly were
                            Tchepone, Attopeu and Saravane to come wholly under their control. It is
                            for this reason that there is strong sentiment, on both the US and
                            Vietnamese sides for more covert pressure on the Laos corridor and on
                            North Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> expressed satisfaction
                            with the growth of offensive military activity, and enthusiasm with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s formal approval
                            of 1 July as the beginning of Phase II of the National Campaign.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question as to how the Viet Cong would react to this
                            intensified effort, he responded that, in his judgment, they are already
                            reacting—steadily acquiring forces and material in southern Laos. These,
                            he says, will be used in a powerful attack in the highlands or Quang
                            Ngai, to deal the Vietnamese military a hard blow, which can then be
                            publicized as a basis for seeking a negotiated peace.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is
                            quite as alert as any interested American regarding the unfavorable
                            image of the Vietnam war in the US press, and the necessity for getting
                            what he called “the correct story” before the US Congress. Also, like
                            the interested Americans, he was not prepared to offer any dramatic
                            suggestions as to just how to achieve this purpose.</p>

                        <p>The intensity of offensive operations is growing steadily, at a cost to
                            the Viet Cong of over 2,000 battle casualties per month. Defections are
                            increasing rapidly—from 200 per month in January to 450 in June. Over
                            60% of the Vietnamese rural population is in strategic hamlets, with a
                            consequent narrowing of the Viet Cong recruitment base. Finally, the
                            “Open Arms” amnesty program is beginning to diminish the number of
                            active Viet Cong sympathizers and supporters.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, it is not surprising to find the Advisory

                            dropped—from a high of 100,000 to 80,000. The Viet Cong now have less to
                            offer the Vietnamese youth and, to the extent that they must rely on
                            kidnapping to procure replacements, their problem is greatly complicated
                            by the personal security afforded by the strategic hamlet.</p>

                            22,000-25,000. Both the Vietnamese and US authorities questioned were
                            convinced that this strength is maintained largely by infiltration,
                            supplemented by intensive training of selected local cadres.</p>

                            the various US staff and administrative support forces. General

                            reduction of 1,000 men could be accomplished now, without affecting
                            adversely the conduct of the war. About half of the positions vacated,
                            as he sees it, would come as a result of the Vietnamese achieving
                            greater self-sufficiency in training and command matters, with the other
                            half coming from a withdrawal or replacement of US units.</p>

                            manifest; US/Vietnamese coordination is heartening; and the morale of US
                            military forces is classic.</p>
                        <p>Acknowledging that this trip dwelt mainly upon the rural sector;
                            acknowledging further the potential gravity of the political vibrations
                            in Saigon; and recognizing the rapidity with which the situation could
                            be worsened by adverse developments in Laos, the visit still added
                            substance to the view that we are indeed winning the war, that our
                            present course is sound and that, resolutely pursued, it will see the
                            job done.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> opened with a
                            review of the Buddhist situation which he characterized as serious. He
                            regretted that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had not
                            taken it in hand earlier, but emphasized that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had given his word that the
                            agreement would be carried out. It was <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName>’s experience that when <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> gave his word, he followed
                            through although sometimes it was handled in his own way.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from the Under Secretary as to the future course
                            of events, the Ambassador replied that although interference by the Nhus
                            was serious, he believed that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would be able to come through this one slowly. As to tactics, the more
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was prodded the slower
                            he went. While <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was
                            troublesome he was chiefly responsible for gains which had been made in
                            the provincial pacification program.</p>
                        <p>Giving a characterization of Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said that she was authoritarian to her finger
                            tips, violently nationalistic and an attractive woman who was both glib
                            and intolerant. She considered herself a most important person in her
                            own right since she was head of the Women’s Solidarity Movement. Her
                            manner was her worst drawback.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked what would happen if there were a change in
                            government. The Ambassador replied that he would give his view which was
                            not completely shared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1"
                            >Wood</persName>. In his view if a revolution occurred in Viet-Nam which
                            grew out of the Buddhist situation, the country would be split between
                            feuding factions and the Americans would have to withdraw and the
                            country might be lost to the Communists. This led to the question of how
                            much pressure we could exert on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> replied that if we repudiated him on this issue
                            his government would fall. The Ambassador believed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would live up to the agreement
                            unless he believed that he was dealing with a political attempt to cause
                            his overthrow.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0493"/>
                        <p>As to the role of the Catholics in the Government, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> did not believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> gave them preference.
                            Unfortunately, many persons in the government felt that it would help
                            their careers if they became Catholic. It was true that the Government
                            had been unwise in the ostentatious manner in which it supported and
                            encouraged the publicizing of Catholic ceremonies, however. In general,
                            Viet-Nam had been a country in which there was a great degree of
                            religious tolerance. Now the situation seemed out of hand. It was
                            deplorable because we had been winning.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            and Communist China, the Ambassador added that if there were a political
                            collapse in Viet-Nam and the U.S. had to withdraw, the Chinese would say
                            that this proved that the right way to expand Communism was to use
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary inquired whether there was any one person around whom
                            conflicting groups in Viet-Nam might coalesce in the event of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s disappearance from the scene.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that
                            Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, a Buddhist,
                            would be the best person, but would be opposed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. The Under Secretary said that
                            everyone agreed that the Ambassador had done a “swell job” in Viet-Nam.
                            The Ambassador thanked the Under Secretary and said he had been pleased
                            to have been able to speak to the Council on Foreign Relations in New
                            York. The discussion seemed to have gone well and the questions had been
                            friendly.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the appointment of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> commented that the more <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> was built up as a strong man who
                            was going to tell <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> where to
                            get off, the harder it would be for <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> to do his job in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary suggested that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> could reassure President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> on this point.</p>

                                xml:id="d209fn2">Telegram 1257 from Saigon, June 29, was the monthly
                                report by the Saigon Task Force, containing an overall assessment of
                                the success of the initial phase of the South Vietnamese
                                Government’s National Campaign, which reads as follows: <p>“Although
                                    directive states that Phase II of National Campaign Plan to be
                                    initiated on 1 July, specific tasks outlined are more in
                                    consonance with those prescribed for Phase I of Plan. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> had established 30
                                    June as date Phase I of Plan would be completed. This based on
                                    projected completion of two-thirds of strategic hamlets then
                                    planned. This target has not been reached, and indications are
                                    that 31 December 1963 is more realistic target date for most
                                    provinces. Current analyses by <gloss target="#t_MACV1"
                                        >MACV</gloss> indicate that populace and land area base

                                    as yet, been obtained.</p>
                                <p>“It is apparent that reason for directing implementation of Phase
                                    II of National Campaign Plan is psychological and it cannot, in
                                    fact, be implemented at this time. Specific actions prescribed
                                    suggest that this is realized at least by military.” (<hi

                            Principal political criterion for successful conclusion of Phase I of
                            National Campaign Plan (<gloss target="#t_NCP1">NCP</gloss>) was
                            completion of 2/3 of Strategic Hamlet Program. This criterion had been
                            met nationwide, except for Delta in IV Corps tactical zone, well before
                            target completion date of 1 July 1963. It could have been serious
                            set-back had <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> taken this

                        <p>June 29th wrap-up report treatment is technically correct in terms of

                                >JGS</gloss> instructions of June 18 adjusts military tasks and
                            concepts in manner acceptable to US. It accommodates situation and

                            Terms Phase I, II and III used in <gloss target="#t_NCP1">NCP</gloss>
                            have now lost all real validity in context evaluating over-all national
                            progress. Tasks and objectives outlined in three nominal phases,
                            however, remain essentially valid and provide solid guidelines for
                            control, direction and evaluation of counter-insurgency military effort

                                >VC</gloss> counterparts which face them, there is every reason
                            believe that, in many military and political subdivisions of country,
                            pacification will shortly be so far along, if current rates are
                            maintained, that major elements of regular <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1"
                                >RVNAF</gloss> forces can be redeployed to more active areas where
                            progress is not as fast and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> problem is
                            tougher.</p>
                        <p>General Ty’s order might be narrowly construed as limited to
                            psychological impact on recipients in some areas of <gloss
                                target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, principally in Delta. Even here,
                            however, instructions clarify and re-emphasize uncompleted tasks and
                            objectives of so-called Phase I of <gloss target="#t_NCP1">NCP</gloss>.
                            As a practical matter, <gloss target="#t_NCP1">NCP</gloss> objectives of

                            mutually supporting, though to different degrees in different areas of
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. Current and continuing problem
                            facing US military advisors in their military planning role is to
                            determine logical balance of effort in each of several areas of <gloss

                            in counter-insurgency. Progress here is afoot. There remains no doubts
                            that military defeat of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is attainable,
                            barring catastrophic political or social development in <gloss

                            July, over 2/3 of strategic hamlets planned have been completed,
                            nationwide. Over eight million people are now living in these hamlets,
                            who together with those living in secure metropolitan areas, comprise
                            well over 2/a of population. <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>

                            correspondents, following Buddhist ceremony at Saigon Chantareansey
                            Pagoda. One <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> reporter (Arnett)<note

                            roughed up; cameras at least two other reporters damaged by police.</p>
                        <p>I have talked to several of correspondents involved (<persName
                                corresp="#p_BM1">Browne</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SN1"

                                >Halberstam</persName>) as well as several Mission personnel present
                            on scene. Appears that press had been informed by Buddhists in advance
                            of ceremony (as had our people). They showed up at 0800 and were allowed
                            to observe and photograph ceremony without hindrance. (I understand CBS
                            had camera and lights actually mounted in window of pagoda.)</p>
                        <p>At about 0900 bonzes and bonzesses left pagoda and moved in procession up
                            very narrow alley towards main street. Police stopped them at exit of
                            alley with object of preventing their carrying procession further. This
                            was eventually accomplished without apparently any serious protest from
                            bonzes.</p>
                        <p>At point procession stopped American reporters moved into alley to take
                            pictures. It seems clear that plain-clothes police sought to interfere
                            with picture taking and that in process Arnett’s camera was snatched
                            away from him and he was thrown to ground. Picture thereafter is far
                            from clear but there seems no doubt that plainclothesmen sought to
                            prevent picture taking and damaged cameras. Also clear that uniformed
                            police made no effort to prevent damage to cameras and in fact tacitly
                            abetted plainclothesmen. There is also no doubt that reporters, at least
                            once fracas had started, acted in belligerent manner towards police.</p>

                        <p>On basis all available information, I am far from satisfied there was
                            planned harassment of press in this instance, particularly considering
                            fact that reporters had been operating freely for at least an hour
                            before incident. Much more likely, in my view, that this was relatively
                            commonplace contretemps in crowded place between reporters and police.
                            Police officials on scene informed Embassy security officer that they so
                            regard it and that incident, in their view, is closed.</p>

                            discussion of matter, including making sure if possible that reporters’

                        <p>I also do not believe that case of this kind justifies filing of copy by
                            government channels but would welcome guidance on this point.</p>

                            will be no delay in transmission of press cables. According to Tao,
                            police claim that correspondents provoked them by protesting police
                            hold-up of procession and that one correspondent struck police first.
                            Tao says he does not wish to pursue this, not feeling sure of police
                            story. Given extreme emotional involvement of correspondents these
                            days—amounting regrettably to intense hatred of all things <gloss

                        <p>Mister President, this Sunday morning at the entrance to Chantareansay
                            Pagoda in Saigon nine representatives of American news organizations
                            were subjected to a swift unprovoked and violent attack by government
                            plain clothes police while covering an otherwise peaceful Buddhist
                            religious ceremony. One correspondent was knocked down and kicked. Other
                            newsmen were shoved, jostled and struck by rocks thrown by the
                            plainclothesmen-all in full sight of forty to sixty uniformed
                            metropolitan policemen and a squad of riot police. In the course of the
                            attack one camera was smashed and several damaged.</p>
                        <p>The uniformed police did not offer any protection to the newsmen and in
                            fact did everything to prevent the correspondents from apprehending the
                            men who were attacking them.</p>
                        <p>The inescapable conclusion is that the Government of South Vietnam, a
                            country to which the United States is heavily committed, has begun a
                            campaign of open physical intimidation to prevent the covering of news
                            which we feel Americans have a right to know.</p>
                        <p>Previously foreign correspondents have been expelled from South Vietnam.
                            This is the first time they have been assaulted by representatives of
                            the government. We believe a precedent has been set for increasing
                            obstruction and violence. Since the United States Embassy here does not
                            deem this incident serious enough to make a formal protest, we
                            respectfully request that you, Mister President, protest against this
                            attack and obtain assurances that will not be repeated.<note n="2"

                            <item>In Saigon the political situation remains unsettled with both the
                                government and the Buddhists continuing to exchange charges of bad
                                faith. Elements on each side appear intent upon the submission of
                                the other. Against this background, the coup atmosphere has become
                                perceptibly heavier. During the past few days, coup groups have
                                formed to take advantage of the instability attending the Buddhist
                                crisis. It is not clear at this time whether these groups intend to
                                await further emotional outbursts, which would occur if there are
                                additional Buddhist self-immolations, or whether they are now
                                prepared to move ahead at a time of their choosing, regardless of
                                what the Buddhists do. Buddhist strategy is polarizing around the

                                has not yet given its consent. Others have leaned toward the 7th of
                                July, the traditional date for the celebration of Double 7 which

                                June agreement. For the moment, the Buddhist complaints center on
                                alleged chicanery concerning the number of arrested participants in
                                the 16th June riot who have been released; alleged <gloss

                                claim documentary proof, that the government, or elements thereof,
                                have backhandedly encouraged the Republican Youth to question
                                whether the government may not have been too generous in its
                                concessions to the Buddhists. The Buddhists also claim that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has quietly sent
                                instructions to its provincial representatives to give pro forma lip

                                to ready themselves for future repressive measures. The Buddhist
                                hierarchy alleges that even now Buddhist monks and nuns in the

                            <item>It is difficult to pin down these charges. Judged by the regime’s
                                past performance in dealing with political opponents, which is
                                generally the way it views the Buddhist leadership, and by reports
                                from others, there is probably considerable truth to these Buddhist
                                assertions. However, the relative merit or truth of the Buddhist
                                charges is not as important in the present context as the fact that
                                the Buddhists are sticking to them, reflecting a profound chasm
                                between them and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Buddhist
                                spokesmen at Xa Loi convey the unmistakable impression that even if
                                the government can satisfactorily refute these charges, the
                                Buddhists will raise new charges and the militant wing indicate they
                                intend to keep up the pressure until the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime is overthrown. Thus,
                                the Buddhists, at least those under the influence of Thich Tri
                                Quang, appear to be consciously transferring their struggle to the
                                political realm. Whether they are using political means to overthrow
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> out of honest
                                conviction that only in this way can greater religious equality be
                                assured in Vietnam, or whether more secular motives are also
                                involved, can at this time only be a matter of surmise. The Buddhist
                                leaders vigorously deny accepting the help of, or being influenced
                                by, outside opposition political elements, and to date there is
                                little evidence with which to challenge that claim. Nevertheless, it
                                must be remembered that the line here between formal participation
                                in religious affairs as a Buddhist monk and secular life is
                                extremely fluid. The Buddhist struggle, adopted initially
                                essentially to redress real and <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"

                                transformed itself into an entirely new political force whose aims
                                transcend the basically religious purposes for which it was
                                originally set in motion.</item>

                                of reasons, perhaps including a desire to see the effect of
                                international pressures on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName>; a suspicion or even knowledge that a coup

                                how the rumored struggle within the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                    >GVN</gloss> itself over the Buddhist question played itself

                                sacrificial self-destruction. Some of the Buddhist leaders appear
                                completely set on the elimination of the <persName

                            <item>There are indications that the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> regime is aware of the peril which it is now
                                in, but there are equally voluminous signs of divided counsel on how
                                to cope with the problem. A <persName>Ngo</persName> family
                                conference was held in Hue on 29 and 30 June, but unfortunately its
                                results are still unknown. From the Times of Vietnam articles, which
                                periodically refan the flames of controversy, from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu’s</persName> statements and from
                                other bits of information, it appears clear that the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s were opposed to going as far
                                as the government did in the 16 June agreement. It seems equally
                                clear that Secretary of State at the Presidency <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NDT2">Nguyen Dinh Thuan</persName> and Vice
                                President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, with Minister
                                of Interior <persName corresp="#p_BVL1">Bui Van Luong</persName>
                                included, but perhaps reluctantly, are in favor of the agreement
                                they hammered out with the Buddhists and would like to see it
                                honorably carried out. <persName corresp="#p_NDC1">Ngo Dinh
                                    Can</persName>’s position on the Buddhist issue is the subject
                                of conflicting reports, and the President’s mood is even more
                                difficult to fathom. The best guess is that at the moment he is
                                being buffeted by conflicting advice within his immediate entourage
                                and by various domestic and international pressures, and that he has
                                not yet made up his mind. Almost certainly, the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime is currently
                                undergoing a crisis of decision as to whether to adopt repressive
                                tactics against the Buddhists or to make further conciliatory
                                gestures toward them.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>In making that decision, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> faces a difficult dilemma. Repressive measures,
                                such as the arrest of his leading Buddhist antagonists, might play
                                into his enemies’ hands by creating just the pretext they have been
                                looking for to move decisively against him. If he does nothing, he
                                will invite international condemnation by elements ready to accept
                                the Buddhists’ case against him lock, stock and barrel, as well as
                                to permit the internal situation to drift even more dangerously
                                close <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>to disaster for his
                                regime. However, if he makes the gestures of further conciliation
                                toward the Buddhists currently being pressed upon him, he has no
                                assurance that these will satisfy them and no guarantee that such
                                gestures, which could be interpreted as additional signs of
                                weakness, would not merely whet the appetite of his antagonists for
                                further unsustainable concessions. Although the latter course would
                                appear to be the least of several evils from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s point of view, it is feared
                                that it is the one least congenial to the President’s temperament,
                                and it is not probable that he will adopt it, regardless of the
                                pressures imposed upon him.</item>

                            tend to disagree with (b) and (c). Their main point is that the United
                            States must avoid allowing its own interests to be confused with those
                            of the regime in Saigon. If our estimate is that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> will take appropriate measures to
                            pacify the situation and will thus survive, then in our own best
                            interests we could be active in our support of him personally. If, on
                            the other hand, our estimate is that his political ineptitude in recent
                            weeks has so weakened his support within Vietnam that he cannot be
                            expected to hold out much longer, then we should be careful to maintain
                            a reasonably friendly touch with potential leaders of non-Communist coup
                            attempts. Our dilemma at the moment is that we cannot yet agree on the
                            estimate. In general, people in Washington are somewhat more pessimistic
                            about <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s chances of riding
                            this one out than people in the field. You can argue both ways on whose
                            judgment is better at this particular moment. In light of this, my own
                            judgment is that we are entering a period in which our policy must be
                            one of fence sitting, realizing of course that such a policy constitutes
                            something less than full identification between our own interests and
                            those of President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As a practical matter, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName>’s return to Saigon will tend to encourage
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to feel that he
                            continues to enjoy our support. On balance I think that this is probably
                            the right course to take, <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0508"
                            />provided the Department is vigorous in needling <persName

                            stabilize the situation. It is, perhaps, the last effort we can make in
                            this direction and should be taken if only for that reason.</p>
                        <p>It may not work, however; and we should be prepared to recall <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> before <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s arrival if our estimate of

                            markedly adverse. At such a time it would be better, in my opinion, to

                            be useful in maintaining a degree of flexibility in the U.S. position
                            which would give <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> a

                            which I talked at length with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>, his top colleagues, US Embassy and military

                                >ICC</gloss> and other informed individuals, left me with profound
                            feeling of concern.</p>
                        <p>Situation appears paradoxical in that military measures against Viet Cong
                            are making substantial progress while political outlook sharply
                            deteriorates.</p>
                        <p>Many qualified observers, in and out of government, privately assert that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime is probably
                            doomed and that while political and military risks involved in a
                            switchover are substantial they may now be less dangerous than
                            continuation of Ngo family in present role.</p>
                        <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>My personal views are necessarily tentative due to shortness of stay and
                            difficulty of forming objective judgments because of deep commitment of
                            almost all American observers to positions which they have held over a
                            period of time and bitter impasse between US officialdom and US
                            press.</p>
                        <p>However, I left Saigon with feeling that a political explosion is likely
                            in foreseeable future and that a fresh US government evaluation of
                            political situation is urgently needed by someone who is not emotionally
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Embassy instructions for various overturn contingencies also needed.</p>
                        <p>Do not believe that re-evaluation should wait until new Ambassador
                            arrives in September nor, with due respect to present incumbent, can we
                            expect a fully balanced evaluation from those who have been directly
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Therefore strongly suggest some informed US official who has full
                            confidence of President and Secretary visit Saigon on a most urgent
                            basis. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Roger Hilsman</persName> would seem to
                            be obvious choice. However <persName corresp="#p_HTL1">Tom

                                line taken by the US. This attitude will almost certainly persist
                                and further pressure to reduce the US presence in the country is
                                likely. (Paras. 10-12).</item>

                            <item>Thus far, the Buddhist issue has not been effectively exploited by
                                the Communists, nor does it appear to have had any appreciable
                                effect on the counterinsurgency effort. We do not think <persName

                                non-Communist opponents. A non-Communist successor regime might be
                                initially less effective against the Viet Cong, but, given continued
                                support from the US, could provide reasonably effective leadership
                                for the government and the war effort. (Pares. 7, 15-17)</item>

                                resentment aroused by the Buddhist controversy could be allayed.
                                However, even if relations between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                    >GVN</gloss> and the Buddhists are smoothed over, the general

                                regime which the crisis has exacerbated and brought to the fore is
                                likely to persist. Further, if—as is probable—the regime is
                                dilatory, inept, and insincere in handling Buddhist matters, there
                                will probably be renewed demonstrations, and South Vietnam will
                                probably remain in a state of domestic political tension. Under

                            situation here as I see it, after two days of intensive briefings,
                            discussions with American, Vietnamese, and foreign officials and private
                            citizens, including American newsmen, and some sampling of Saigon
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Our patient, I think, is still on critical list, but improving.
                            Difficulties seem to be confined mainly to larger cities, affecting only
                            slightly peasant population in central coastal areas and not at all in
                            Delta. Saigon and Hue are still very volatile and people are scared.
                            Buddhist Association leaders, unfortunately, can still take initiative
                            to bring down government, but seem to be hesitant to do so. Each day
                            that passes slightly increases chances of surmounting this crisis. Coup
                            rumors are rife and evidence of plotting exists, but it is my present
                            judgment that no direct intervention in this matter on our part would be
                            helpful or wise. (Have passed the word on position to be taken if
                            approached, as per instruction.)<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">No such

                            in US intentions, badly shaken by several happenings in past weeks, and
                            subsequent leading of him to take more positive and sensible political
                            actions, will take some time. I have spent seven hours with him since my
                            return and have, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> reports,
                            made some headway, but I have nothing of significance to report in terms
                            of concrete actions or decisions. He is hurt by what he considers
                            misrepresentations and calumnies (both in Viet-Nam and outside), torn by
                            conflicting advice, resentful of US pressure, and not completely in
                            control of his government’s actions (Nhus). He is, in brief, in a
                            martyr’s mood himself. We have not yet been able to persuade him to snap
                            out of it, make a virtue of necessity, and take his case fully and
                            candidly directly to the people. We are still working on this. In my
                            judgment, his motives and intentions are still good; some of his
                            resentments and suspicions concerning the Buddhist agitation are
                            well-founded. He is visibly tired. Our main problem at moment is to get
                            him relaxed enough to take the helm and steer the ship on a true and
                            sensible course.</p>
                        <p>[During] this difficult period, I think our best bet is to work quietly
                            along existing guidelines. While making our views and especially US
                            domestic considerations amply clear, we should not try to blueprint his
                            course for him. Specifically, we should not reiterate our threat of <pb

                            with it if other means of easing the situation (even the passage of

                            we should continue, as has been done, to tell him the facts of life
                            about public opinion at home and let him work out his own accommodation.

                            Generals of a July 11 meeting of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> with officers of that rank. Two (or possibly three)
                            of these reports indicate that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> may be planning a coup. We think it not unlikely,
                            however, that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is responding
                            to reports of coup plotting among the Generals themselves, seeking to
                            confuse and divide them, smoke out their intentions, and rally those
                            which he can reach by such blandishments as “active” assignments. He may
                            have <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0515"/>had the additional
                            intention of improving his personal position with the Generals against
                            the possibility that they will successfully mount a coup.</p>
                        <p>The four reports are not wholly consistent with one another, but the
                            following emerges from all four: (1) <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> asked the Generals for their support; (2) <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> criticized the government and/or
                            his brothers during the meeting; (3) <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> extended an olive branch to the Generals by being
                            very cordial and by promising “active” assignments to all.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> reported <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked for “personal support”;
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> stated <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he would not blame the
                            Generals if they were thinking of a coup and that he would be with them;
                            General Cao merely said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            had asked for their cooperation in meeting the present crisis. One
                            unnamed “general officer” who may or may not have attended the meeting
                            reported that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had spoken of a
                            “lightning” coup with himself leading it. But a large meeting of this
                            sort would not provide a suitably secure forum in which to make a
                            serious proposal of this sort, and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> position on the Buddhist crisis is not one which
                            would be most likely to appeal to dissatisfied officers.</p>
                        <p>Unless the Buddhist crisis deepens, the longer the various coup plots
                            incubate, the less likelihood of anything hatching. We have not yet
                            heard that any coup group has developed a well articulated plan with
                            much chance of success, nor do the Generals appear to be united-and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> move is probably
                            shrewdly intended, among other things, to prevent their uniting.
                            However, this does not eliminate the possibility of a plan being
                            suddenly attempted. We have heard of several, but the better a plan was
                            the less likely we would be to learn of it in advance.</p>

                                    July. The first was a formal meeting at Joint General Staff
                                    offices. The second followed immediately after the first at the
                                    Officers Club at the Joint General Staff. The general officer
                                    states clearly that his report derives from the Officers Club
                                    talk, although he attended both meetings. We are not clear as to
                                    those present at either meeting. General <persName

                            Question of course, is whether <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"

                                    >footnote 4, Document 223</ref>.</note> I called <persName

                            quickly. I urged that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> not
                            wait until committee had completed draft speech, but that he should
                            immediately make a general appeal for calm and order and engage his own
                            prestige re fulfillment June 16 agreements; this to be followed as soon
                            as possible by fuller and more specific delineation of measures to be
                            taken. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> is now trying to
                            sell this. I have given draft speech<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">Not

                            possible use in this connection.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> reported
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> agreed last night not
                            to rely exclusively on Province Chiefs’ reports re religious grievances,
                            but to make special investigations from Saigon of all Buddhist
                            complaints. This may be belated reaction to our continued questioning of
                            information on which some of his decisions and non-actions have been
                            based.</p>
                        <p>As to prospects here, experience has demonstrated, I think, that there is
                            enormous potential for stretch in Vietnamese body politic. Events which
                            normally would indicate imminent downfall of a government would not
                            necessarily do so here. I continue to feel there is reasonably good
                            prospect of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s surmounting the
                            present two-headed crisis (Buddhist agitation and coup plotting). It is,
                            of course, imperative that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            come forward with positive appeal and measures, and this has been made
                            amply clear to him. We have the promise of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> support to this end. We may therefore have
                            sufficient influence working in same direction to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to move, although no one can
                            guarantee what the baby will look like if and when it is born.</p>

                            State. A correspondent asked if the difficulties between the Buddhists
                            and the South Vietnamese Government were impeding the effectiveness of
                            U.S. aid in the war against the Viet Cong. The President answered:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Yes, I think it has. I think it is unfortunate that this dispute
                                    has arisen at the very time when the military struggle has been
                                    going better than it has been going in many months. I would hope
                                    that some solution could be reached for this dispute, which
                                    certainly began as a religious dispute, and because we have
                                    invested a tremendous amount of effort and it is going quite
                                    well.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>He next expressed his hope that the dispute would be settled to allow a
                            stable government in South Vietnam, able to maintain national
                            independence, and that “behind this military shield put up by the
                            Vietnamese people they can reach an agreement on the civil disturbances
                            and also in respect for the rights of others. That’s our hope. That’s

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> expressed his
                            appreciation for this chance to talk with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and said he had wanted for some
                            time to come to Southeast Asia, an area he had never visited. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he was
                            responsible in the Department of State for dealing with matters bearing
                            upon public and political opinion, and hoped to be able to return to
                            Washington with more complete information and a better understanding of
                            this area of US/Vietnamese relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he was very glad to
                            see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>, particularly
                            because the area of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>’s
                            responsibility, public and political opinion, is the area in which the
                            Government of Vietnam is weakest. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that Vietnam is a very underdeveloped country
                            insofar as public relations are concerned and in its sensitivity to U.S.
                            and world public opinion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            said the two fields in which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            development was most laggard were: 1) the collection and use of security
                            intelligence; 2) dealing with public opinion and public relations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that as a former
                            journalist and a political appointee of the <persName corresp="#p_KJE1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Administration, he was deeply interested in the
                            practical aspects of government public relations work. Sometimes the
                            practical solution to Government public opinion problems lies in
                            simplicity, rather than a massive and formal government public relations
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> agreed but said that there
                            were certain principles which are traditional and which have not been
                            respected and which must be observed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that there are
                            two kinds of principles, both very important. The first has to do with
                            reporting itself, and is the justification for the resentment which the
                            victims feel when they are subjected to unfair and unobjective
                            reporting. Secondly, there is also the important operating principle for
                            the United States in the kind of involvement in which it finds itself in
                            Vietnam. The realities of American politics make it essential that there
                            be some kind of scrutiny in reporting of U.S. involvement. The American
                            political system is such that U.S. Government involvement in a situation
                            such as obtains in Vietnam requires, as air requires oxygen, that U.S.
                            correspondents be present to observe and to formulate and transmit
                            reports back to the American people.</p>
                        <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0524"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that in theory he
                            agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> and he
                            thought it would all work well if we could cap our efforts with success,
                            but, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked, is it
                            possible to reach success if the U.S. correspondents do not stick to the
                            principles of fair and objective reporting? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> feeling of irritability at the American
                            correspondents was due not so much to unjustified as to unfair
                            reporting. He understood how the American reporters had arrived at their
                            views and even recognized that there is some justification for their
                            point of view, for the following three reasons.</p>
                        <p>First, the many “bad rumors” both in the United States and in Vietnam,
                            start with high <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials in
                            authoritative positions close to the President. This is an old
                            phenomenon, and there have been fewer bad rumors from Vietnamese
                            Government officials in the past year. However, the U.S. press,
                            Congressional figures, and even many U.S. executive officials, have
                            received their “inside information” not from opposition sources but from
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials themselves. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he could not blame
                            the Americans for attaching credence to antigovernment information
                            received from such sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> digressed to observe that
                            he was speaking to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>
                            very frankly about this matter, for without candor there could be no
                            useful results from their talk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> expressed his
                            appreciation and agreed that candor was needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he was not simply
                            imagining that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials were the
                            source of many of the bad rumors. He knew of many specific cases. For
                            example, he knew who had given Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1"
                                >Mansfield</persName> misleading and inaccurate information. How,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked, can you expect
                            U.S. reporters not to believe these close friends of President Diem?
                            However wrong, therefore, the views of the American correspondents, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> did not blame them and,
                            in fact, understood them and their point of view.</p>
                        <p>Rhetorically, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked why
                            the high-ranking <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials
                            disseminated these untruths, and more importantly, the half truths? He
                            said such behavior was characteristic of underdeveloped countries where
                            information is imperfect and public relations policies were ineffective.
                            The Government officials themselves know most imperfectly the true
                            situation and in their own confusion and ignorance lead them to confuse
                            and to pass on inaccurate impressions to newsmen on subjects in which
                            they had no real competence. From his own experience, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> thought that the study system which
                            the Government of Vietnam has been holding for the past year had
                            obtained great results in giving to high <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> officials a more complete and more accurate
                            understanding of the national situation and of the activities of the
                            Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said it had been American
                            friends who had advised of this system and that American money had been
                            made available in some cases to help finance the activity. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that a wide range of people
                            from university professors to village leaders have personally told him
                            that these study sessions have afforded them their first real
                            opportunity to make a proper assessment of the situation in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that there had been a
                            number of innovations since the creation of the Committee for Strategic
                            Hamlets: 1) institutional reform; 2) study sessions and a more active
                            public information program; 3) the Montagnard program; 4) (translated
                            incomprehensively not understood in French). These innovations plus the
                            Strategic Hamlet program, had created a sense of momentum as well as a
                            better understanding among the people of Vietnam’s just cause.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> then said there were two
                            other reasons why high government officials gave misleading and
                            inaccurate information to correspondents, and both of these reasons were
                            also related to the fact that Vietnam is an underdeveloped country.
                            First, it is characteristic of officials in underdeveloped countries to
                            think themselves capable of holding higher positions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> emphasized he was speaking not of
                            the opposition but of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials.
                            This dissatisfaction with their position led them sometimes into
                            captious and critical remarks concerning government programs. Second, a
                            lack of candor and honesty is a requisite among the subject peoples
                            under a colonial government. People therefore learn never to speak with
                            complete honesty and candor but to color their remarks according to
                            their auditors. Many of the Vietnamese people and officials have yet to
                            grow out of this colonial mentality. On every issue they have three or
                            four attitudes to express, depending upon their interlocutor. It
                            therefore becomes very difficult for Americans (both reporters and other
                            Americans) to know what is objective and what is not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he had made a special
                            study of this matter and had to confess that despite his study and
                            despite the fact that he was a Vietnamese himself, he found it extremely
                            difficult to know the real opinion of the Vietnamese who came to see
                            him.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons stated above, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said, Americans of all kinds (professors,
                            intellectuals, government officials) cannot be blamed if their talks
                            with Vietnamese leave the Americans confused as to where the truth
                            stands. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he knew that
                            his government’s efforts could not succeed unless a favorable climate
                            for the free discussion of all problems was created. However, a great
                            effort had been made in this direction in the past year and there had
                            been progress. The U.S. public opinion at the present time is founded on
                            the total sum of the rumors built up over the last seven or eight years.
                            It is this foundation which makes American public opinion so hostile to
                            the Government of Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said he was trying to dissipate the <pb n="500"
                                xml:id="pg_500" facs="0526"/>rumors and untruths through frank talks
                            with Americans, particularly American officials. He stated that he would
                            continue to try to sit down and talk with Americans as brothers and
                            comrades. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said it was not
                            his job to defend the present regime. Rather, it was his ambition to
                            solve the very problem of underdevelopment and the effects of
                            underdevelopment on public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he recognized fully
                            the importance of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>’s
                            second principle. He understood that the United States cannot change its
                            institutions to please the Vietnamese Government, but the situation is a
                            very delicate one. He recognized that U.S. opinion is impatient with the
                            fact that, despite the massive infusion of U.S. aid to Vietnam, the
                            political, economic and social situation in Vietnam still does not
                            correspond perfectly to the U.S. pattern.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> stated he realized there
                            was a kind of “bad U.S. conscience about this war, but one cannot win a
                            war with a bad conscience.” What is needed, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said, is not perfection-but
                            improvement.</p>
                        <p>The problem is not merely a Vietnamese problem but a worldwide one. The
                            starting point here and in Thailand, and in all other underdeveloped
                            countries, is the serious difficulty of trying to create a democracy in
                            an underdeveloped land. The critical and almost insoluble problem is how
                            to build democratic institutions upon an underdeveloped foundation. In
                            Vietnam the Strategic Hamlet program aims at solving this contradiction
                            between the state of development and yearnings for democracy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> observed wryly that he had
                            now done his mea culpa and would like to speak about the American
                            correspondents. Their attitude is a systematic refusal to listen to, to
                            understand or to report the attitude of the Vietnamese Government. The
                            American correspondents deliberately reflect in their reporting only one
                            point of view and that is the point of view of those hostile to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This applies not only to
                            Vietnamese officials but also to sympathetic American officials. For
                            example, the American correspondents were not interested in Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s ideas. They refused
                            to attend a press conference of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1"
                                >Felt</persName>’s last week. In fact, they consistently refused
                            even to approach anyone who had a view or a vision different than their
                            own. This attitude does not accord with a true journalistic attitude.
                            The U.S. public needs to be informed of the whole picture. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he did not ask that the
                            American correspondents tell lies, but was offended by their refusal of
                            invitations to see or to hear anything not in accord with their own
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that these young
                            reporters want nothing less than to make a government. This was, indeed,
                            an exalting ambition. It was a stimulating pastime indeed for three or
                            four of them to get together on a concerted effort to overthrow and to
                            create governments. They find <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0527"
                            />in the United States an atmosphere receptive to their efforts because
                            U.S. Congressional and executive officials have, for years, been
                            influenced by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials to adopt
                            attitudes inimical to the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime. Everything is set for a fundamental reassessment by the United
                            States of the situation in Vietnam. All conditions are favorable for a
                            complete U.S. change of policy in Vietnam. It is a great opportunity and
                            it would be tremendous sacrifice for those hostile to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime to give up this
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that these were the
                            realities and it was necessary for a Vietnamese patriot to face them
                            squarely. He said that a change of government now would be of benefit
                            only to the Communists. Yet he realized how difficult it was for the
                            Americans, and for this reason he had been thinking of a different kind
                            of aid, a kind of aid which would not involve any moral commitment on
                            the part of the United States to the Vietnamese Government, but would,
                            nonetheless, continue to be effective in content.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he was thinking along
                            these lines because he realized that what is now going on in Vietnam, if
                            presented in a certain way, cannot but affect the state of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> Administration. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> observed that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> is a Catholic and therefore is
                            in a kind of minority. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            said that he, too, was a Catholic, but tended to mistrust other
                            Catholics because he found that Catholics always have a guilt complex.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that if one is
                            afflicted with a guilt complex there is a very great difficulty in
                            following through on an effective program of action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he was thinking
                            of aid along the lines of the wartime Lend Lease program. Such a program
                            would have the advantage of more flexibility and it would not commit the
                            United States Government in the Vietnamese fight against communism. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he did not know very
                            much about Lend Lease but believed that such a program presupposed the
                            existence of a plan. In an underdeveloped country a perfect and complete
                            plan was, by definition, impossible. Insisting upon one has only the
                            effect of delaying the provision of aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he was attracted
                            to the idea of changing the U.S. assistance to Vietnam to a Lend Lease
                            type program because of the precedent of such a program in World War II.
                            He said that American aid to Stalin in World War II obviously involved
                            no moral commitment. The United States was fighting Hitler and was
                            prepared to help anyone who was fighting Hitler. In that situation U.S.
                            aid did not imply any approval of the aid recipient.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that his idea on Lend
                            Lease was a strictly personal thing. However, he observed, if we are to
                            succeed in Vietnam-and if the United States’ worldwide strategy against
                            communism is to succeed-the U.S. aid policy must be revised.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0528"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> asked if, under the
                            type program envisioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, the United States would continue to have an
                            advisory role in Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            responded that he supposed it would work as it had in Russia where he
                            understood there were a number of American advisors. In fact, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, Vietnam would doubtless
                            ask for more. Vietnam had a great need for advisors, particularly
                            editors. The Vietnamese can write nothing effective publicizing their
                            own cause because they are too scrupulous. People ask why President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> does not talk more
                            often to the Vietnamese people, as do the American presidents. A major
                            reason is simply the lack of ghost writers.</p>
                        <p>As an example of the inability of the Vietnamese Government to present
                            its own case, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> cited the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said the Vietnamese cannot
                            understand Americans. Therefore they needed someone to help them
                            interpret themselves for American consumption. Yet, when the <gloss

                            Relations firm it was accused of trying to create a lobby. Mr <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> had neither the means nor the intention to create a
                            lobby. He said the United States is new and strange and foreign to
                            Vietnamese. He said that he himself had come to understand his American
                            friends better in the last three weeks. It was this lack of
                            understanding which led the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to try
                            to use someone who would understand Americans and know how to convey to
                            Americans the Vietnamese point of view. As of now, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said, the American people do not
                            know our point of view and cannot get to know it since the public has
                            access only to the point of view of those opposed to the Vietnamese
                            Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was the target of a campaign,
                            whether deliberate or not, to convince the U.S. public that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is not sincere. The United States now
                            believes that. If Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>
                            could somehow, during his short stay, reverse that belief it would be a
                            large accomplishment indeed. That, of course, was too much to expect,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said. However, he said he
                            placed his trust in American fair play.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he would not
                            attempt to speak to all of the points raised, but did wish to address
                            himself to several matters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> urged that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> be frank and said that he considered himself a
                            soldier fighting in a mortal war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> had expressed the belief that there was wide-spread
                            disillusionment <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0529"/>about the
                            situation in Vietnam, both on the part of U.S. leaders and the U.S.
                            public. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that
                            this belief was in no sense justified. The views of the United States
                            Government and of the American public must be measured in terms of
                            results. The results show that the American commitment to Vietnam, which
                            was inherited by the <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName>
                            Administration from its predecessor, has been accepted and is being
                            carried out by President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName>
                            and by the American people. Moreover, contrary to the views expressed by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, there is a conviction
                            within the United States Government that we are involved in a winning
                            program in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that the question
                            of changing the nature of the American commitment will not be decided by
                            journalists either in Vietnam or elsewhere. Such decisions will be made
                            by the United States Government, and the position of the United States
                            Government at the present time is clear as is the support of the
                            American people for that commitment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that his next
                            point might appear to be contradictory, but that it was important that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> understand the point. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> could understand the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s resentment of the criticism to
                            which it had been subjected. In similar circumstances, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said, he would be furious.
                            Certainly, it would be better if the criticism of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the American press were less
                            intense. However, the very existence of this criticism is one of the
                            things that makes the U.S. commitment to Vietnam and the U.S. effort in
                            Vietnam possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>
                            said he was not attempting to be glib. No one likes to be subjected to
                            criticism and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> was not
                            suggesting that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should be happy
                            about criticism of it appearing in the American press. But President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> and the Secretary of
                            State, both of whom are earnestly determined to carry out the American
                            commitment to Vietnam, must have the tools to do their part of the job.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> is a political
                            leader. He is carrying out a program which, as Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had observed, was bound to create
                            concern and, as time goes on, impatience in the United States.
                            Nonetheless, the President is determined to continue with the effort in
                            Vietnam and to continue to generate the kind of leadership which will
                            give that effort the necessary kind of support in the United States. At
                            the present time, the program does have such support.</p>
                        <p>Next year is an election year in the United States and as the campaign
                            heats up, it will become more and more necessary that the President have
                            the necessary tools to insure a continuance of American public support
                            for the effort in Vietnam. Just as in Vietnam, the opposition will look
                            for weaknesses or for situations which can be interpreted as weaknesses,
                            with which to criticize either the program of the Administration or its
                            implementation.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0530"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he was not
                            referring to the question of images or public relations in the normal
                            sense, but to the fact that the existence in Vietnam of an American
                            press corps free to observe and report on the American involvement was a
                            tool which it was essential that the President have in dealing with
                            public criticism of this policy. If an attempt were made to handcuff the
                            press corps and prevent them from filling their traditional role of
                            reporting to the American public, this would give the critics of the
                            policy a tremendous advantage, and it would make it extremely difficult
                            for the President to answer the critics and maintain public support of
                            the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he agreed that
                            there had been much progress in Vietnam that had not completely come
                            through to the American people. He said it was not necessary that the
                            United States and Vietnamese Governments simply accept that situation.
                            Instead, we should seek ways to get the news of the progress through to
                            the American public.</p>
                        <p>But is necessary that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            understand that, in spite of the sometimes obnoxious reporting from
                            Saigon, the state of United States public opinion on the Vietnamese
                            program is not bad. The President r still has public support for his
                            policy despite the criticisms that have been levied at those policies.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he was glad to hear
                            that, and observed that because we are facing hell, all the forces of
                            hell are leagued against us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he had,
                            since his arrival in Saigon, met with the American correspondents. As
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would doubtless expect,
                            the correspondents were passionate in their views. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he wished in all
                            candor to tell Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> what the
                            correspondents are concerned about. The correspondents, and some of
                            their superiors, with whom Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> had spoken before coming to Vietnam, are deeply
                            fearful that the Government of Vietnam has, or is about to embark on, a
                            campaign here of physical and technical harassment of the
                            correspondents, or of expulsion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he had come
                            to Vietnam mainly to listen rather than to talk. But in view of the
                            concern of the correspondents he hoped strongly that he would be able to
                            take back to Washington with him certain knowledge as to whether or not
                            the fears of the correspondents were justified. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he thought it possible
                            that the correspondents, because of their passionate, emotional
                            involvement, may be magnifying one incident out of proportion. But their
                            concern, whether justified or not, was real, and was to some extent
                            shared by their superiors elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that there was a need
                            on both sides for wisdom. He said that it was his very firm impression
                            that the Government of Vietnam was being oppressed by the U.S. press
                            rather than the American correspondents being oppressed by the
                            Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>If, in fact, the American correspondents in Saigon think that the
                            Government of Vietnam could oppress them, then the correspondents are
                            unrealistic indeed. The Government of Vietnam is weak and in no position
                            to oppress the American correspondents. The fears of the correspondents
                            are based on passion, not on reality. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that an examination of the press despatches
                            from Saigon for the past several years would show that the American
                            correspondents have systematically and consistently been extremely
                            critical of the Vietnamese Government. That is the permanent frame of
                            mind of the American correspondents. As a result, the Government of
                            Vietnam has not only to cope with its hot war, but also a continuing
                            cold war with the American correspondents in Saigon. There is no use to
                            go on with the fight. The American correspondents have succeeded in
                            isolating the Government of Vietnam and then presenting us as monsters
                            to the American people and to the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> asked “What do we want, to win the war or to lose
                            the war?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he had
                            asked the American correspondents not to judge the situation in Vietnam
                            only in its local context, but to view it as part of a world problem of
                            underdeveloped countries engaged in the fight against communism. In
                            Vietnam it is a hot war. The United States is involved in that war
                            because it is in the interest of the United States to see that the war
                            is won, not because it is in the interest of the family of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. In World War II the
                            United States had no intention of glorifying or stabilizing the Stalin
                            regime. Yet the United States assisted the Stalin regime because it
                            wanted to use all available tools in the fight against Hitler.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked why the American
                            correspondents never try to see him. He said that he would be happy to
                            talk with them and try to convey to them a better understanding of the
                            real situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> asked
                            if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would consider holding
                            a press conference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said
                            he did not like press conferences but some of the correspondents could
                            come together if they wished. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> pointed out that such a meeting need not be a
                            formal press conference on the record and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> agreed that a background conference
                            would suit him better. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            said he was prepared to receive the correspondents and to talk with them
                            upon any issue in complete candor and honesty. He said that all issues
                            could be considered and that the correspondents could insult him if they
                            wished. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he would not
                            mind if he were insulted for he considered that the correspondents,
                            although their attitude might be wrong, were actually comrades-in-arms
                            in the struggle against communism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that in dealing with the American
                            correspondents it was good to remember the Biblical observation, “
                                …<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> in
                            the House of the Lord there are many Houses”.</p>
                        <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he knew that the
                            American correspondents carried a very bad opinion of him. He knew that
                            the correspondents considered him basically anti-American, and that they
                            thought that he was constantly seeking to deceive them. If this were so,
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, what would be “my
                            reason for living?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said
                            that one correspondent in a recent Newsweek issue said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> spent all his time reading poetry,
                            but in the same article charged him with controlling everything in
                            Vietnam, the Government, the police, the army, everything.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d226fn4">Newsweek, July 15, 1963, p. 37.</note> Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that neither charge
                            was true. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that so
                            far as poetry was concerned, he supposed that the idea stemmed from a
                            conversation he had once with a reporter in which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> referred to Moses and to the lonely
                            and solitary role he had had to fill in leading the children of Israel
                            to the Promised Land. In this connection, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had mentioned a French poem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that Moses had not
                            really been lonely because he had God with him. But, said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, “I do not feel a divine presence
                            in the American leadership”. When the correspondent asked why, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> replied because he found
                            the American press to be very inhuman in its treatment of him. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that it was
                            unnecessary for r Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to be
                            concerned at the charge that he read poetry, for many Americans admired
                            poetry. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he had only
                            been joking.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he agreed
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> on one important
                            point. That point was that the present state of mind of the American
                            correspondents is grounded on passion. This being so, the problem was
                            not a technical one of press treatment, but a problem of tone. It was
                            not a question of giving to the reporters access to more complete
                            information, but of somehow affecting their treatment of the information
                            already available to them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that this was true, that the problems with the
                            correspondents were all long-standing and old problems but that what had
                            changed in recent times was the tone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> then apologized for not speaking English and said it
                            would be possible to establish greater intimacy if he spoke English.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he was not
                            proposing that either the Vietnamese Government or the American
                            Government get into the business of holding the hands of the
                            correspondents. They were, and should be, on their own. But perhaps some
                            small things could be done to improve the present atmosphere. If
                            anything could improve that atmosphere, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> said that he thought it would be the readmission
                            to Vietnam of Mr. <persName>Robinson</persName>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> correspondent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> asked if Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had yet seen the cable which Mr.
                                <persName>Robinson</persName> recently sent to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d226fn5">Not
                                found.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he
                            had just read the cable</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0533"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he presently
                            believed that the correspondents should be allowed to come freely to
                            Vietnam, and in greater numbers than were now present. But Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked that each reporter observe
                            self-discipline. Without self-discipline on the part of the
                            correspondents Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said, it
                            was impossible to do anything constructive about the present situation.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> to tell the American
                            correspondents on his behalf that he asks of them nothing but objective,
                            fair reporting. He did not ask them to tell lies favorable to the
                            interest of the Government of Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said he would personally tell the correspondents
                            that when he saw them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he wished he
                            could offer some over-night solution to the problem created by the
                            hostility between the correspondents and the Government of Vietnam. But
                            he had no solution to offer. He thought that what was needed was time,
                            and he believed that the solution to the present situation would be a
                            slow process of evolution. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> added he believed that in the end the facts of
                            the situation as seen by both the Government of Vietnam and the American
                            government would prevail and would provide American public opinion with
                            a balanced and accurate picture of the Vietnamese situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he was in a
                            position to go back to the United States and to see a number of
                            influential and fair minded editors and to discuss with them candidly
                            the situation in Vietnam. He would convey to them the fact that it was
                            necessary to view developments in Vietnam in the total world context. He
                            would convey to them the need in the complex Vietnam situation for
                            self-discipline on the part of the American correspondents. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he did not know
                            what the results of his efforts would be but that he thought it both
                            necessary and wise to make the effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he thought the
                            change might take place overnight. He said the Americans were capable of
                            that. He said he did not think that it was really a political problem
                            but was instead a kind of hysteria—a disease.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he did not think
                            it was that bad. Certainly the American correspondents were motivated by
                            passion but he thought their involvement still was somewhat short of
                            hysteria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he had an
                            example which he thought would illustrate the present situation. When
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> returned (and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he admired
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> greatly in
                            having the courage to return at all), the Ambassador had made a
                            statement at the airport. At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> digressed to say that he was not being critical of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> for whom he had
                            great sympathy in view of the way everything fell in on him during
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>’s absence.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> then reverted to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> statement and said
                            that some of the Cabinet Ministers were not much pleased by it.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>Some of his colleagues criticized the statement as not clear cut.
                            However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said, he
                            personally thought it was a very good statement because Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> had said exactly
                            what he thought. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            asked his colleagues whether they expected the Americans to say what
                            they did not think. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said
                            the Vietnamese had no right to expect such a thing. He personally
                            thought the statement was excellent because it was an honest statement
                            of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>’s
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that we need only be
                            sincere in order to win the war. He asked how a little country like
                            Vietnam, underdeveloped and with a population of only 14,000,000, could
                            hope to stand up to the world communist colossus. He asked if the
                            Vietnamese people could assume this burden on their narrow shoulders. He
                            said such an effort would be pure folly except with the assistance of
                            sincere friends. For this reason, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said, U.S. aid was extremely important to Vietnam.
                            But, he asked, how many Vietnamese die and get crippled everyday? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that what the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wanted was understanding, that Vietnam
                            was an underdeveloped and not an advanced country, and the actions of
                            the government be judged in that context. Also, it should be understood
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> does not
                            promise much and that his few promises are given slowly and only after
                            long consideration. But once a promise is given, it is always honored
                            completely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> said that his office
                            was under daily pressure from <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss> to
                            obtain the readmission of Mr. <persName>Robinson</persName>. He asked
                            what word he could give to <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he could not
                            promise the result, but that he personally had no objection to the
                            readmission of Mr. <persName>Robinson</persName>, and that he, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, would try to obtain
                            permission for Robinson to return to Vietnam, provided that Robinson
                            would give the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> too a chance to be
                            heard in the world. That would be only fair play, he said. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJ1">Mecklin</persName> said that it would be very good
                            if Mr. <persName>Robinson</persName> could return in time for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> meeting with the
                            press.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he was always
                            prepared to meet with the correspondents provided they did not distort
                            his remarks. He said he was not too keen about interviews on the record
                            because it seemed to him that in such interviews it was always necessary
                            to play a defensive role. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            said he preferred to talk with the correspondents on a background only
                            basis because this would permit full and free discussions on all issues.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he liked full
                            and free discussions because he was sincere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said he knew there had
                            been mistakes made by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Still he
                            was prepared to recognize these mistakes because only through correcting
                            errors could progress be made. Vietnam must either progress or die.
                            Vietnam could not stand still. Therefore, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said, he was willing to do whatever
                            must be done to make progress.</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that despite the
                            ofttimes unfavorable coverage by the American correspondents of the
                            Vietnam situation, it is a fact that an understanding and sense of
                            involvement in the Vietnam situation is deeply embedded in the American
                            mind. At least in part this is so because of the casualties which
                            Americans have suffered in Vietnam, as slight as those casualties are in
                            comparison to the sufferings of the Vietnamese people. Although the
                            American casualties in some way constitute a great political liability,
                            they also have the result of getting the United States really committed
                            to success in Vietnam just as we were committed in Korea. The United
                            States Government is determined to carry out its commitment to the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> expressed his deep
                            appreciation of this statement and said that he would relay it to the
                            other Ministers in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said the other Ministers
                            were, at the present time, very much “intoxicated” with the idea that
                            the United States is slowly preparing for a withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that he once had a
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Admiral Felt</persName>
                            in which the Admiral told him not to fear American imperialism but to be
                            confident that the Americans would withdraw when their assistance was no
                            longer needed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that
                            the Vietnamese fear was exactly the opposite of what <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAHD1">Admiral Felt</persName> apparently thought. The
                            Vietnamese did not fear that the Americans would implant themselves in
                            Vietnam, but feared instead an American withdrawal before Vietnam could
                            survive alone. But Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said,
                            if Americans and Vietnamese are to live together in great numbers they
                            must have a modus vivendi. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said that before the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> had given agreement to the introduction of 10,000 to
                            12,000 American troops, he had told General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> that the American soldiers would be bored to
                            death without the amusements to which they were accustomed. He urged
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to make full
                            provision for regular rotation to Hong Kong and other places for
                            relaxation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said his
                            advice had not been heeded. He said there was still a great need for
                            such a rotation program at short intervals and that it would be a very
                            good and important psychological move if the United States were to
                            institute such a program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said that another
                            psychological problem stemmed from the fact that the Americans in
                            Vietnam did not feel that their losses and their sacrifices were
                            understood by the American people. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> wondered if it would not be good to “magnify” the
                            American casualties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he understood the
                            point but felt that if the casualties were “magnified” there would be a
                            risk of making an even greater problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> said he recognized that danger and observed that his
                            wife wrote to the families of all U.S. soldiers killed in Vietnam.</p>

                                >Nhu</persName> said it was astonishing to him that a group of
                            American intellectuals could still believe that the American soldiers
                            were involved in Vietnam in fighting a dirty war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> said the communists
                            realized themselves that they are fighting a dirty war. He referred to a
                            recent Viet Cong Battalion Commander who had defected and had informed
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the communists keep the
                            location of their units secret from all except Battalion Commanders, in
                            order to prevent the troops from escaping.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he
                            appreciated this chance to discuss so many different subjects so
                            candidly. He hoped that he would be able to return to the United States
                            with some sense of assurance for the President that the press situation
                            in Vietnam would settle down and not give an additional weapon to the
                            critics of the President’s Vietnam policy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he wanted to stress that
                            if anything occurs to prevent American correspondents from covering the
                            Vietnam situation, it would constitute an extreme danger to the
                            continuity of the President’s policy. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> said that in the kind of operation upon which
                            the United States was embarked in Vietnam, the reporting of the American
                            correspondents played an essential role. The position of the
                            correspondents was analogous to that of building inspectors. The
                            American public expected that they would be there to observe and comment
                            and criticize. Their recommendations are not always accepted nor always
                            believed but the existence of the correspondents and their ability to
                            report on the American involvement is a deeply important psychological
                            and political fact both in Washington and for the American public in
                            general.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he
                            considered his trip an opportunity to learn about the situation in
                            Vietnam. He hoped to learn enough to be able, upon his return to the
                            United States, to convey to American editors and journalists both the
                            complexity and the progress of the Vietnam situation. It was very
                            difficult for people outside Vietnam to understand the complexity of the
                            situation here, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>
                            hoped that American journalists would recognize the necessity of viewing
                            developments in Vietnam in their worldwide context. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that much of the present
                            press difficulty stems from the fact that the day-to-day events in
                            Vietnam are judged narrowly and only in a local context. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he would much appreciate
                            having the President’s views on how the press problem should be
                            handled.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said Vietnam would
                            always welcome journalists with hospitality and expected only that the
                            journalists would meet their primary duty of reporting objectively. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said there were
                            differing interpretations of objectivity, and this difference in
                            interpretation was the core of the problem in Vietnam. Correspondents
                            have a different function than Government officials and this fact often
                            creates problems. Journalists are free agents and part of their function
                            is to be critical of governments. For the United States it is a
                            necessity that Government activities be submitted to press scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that he
                            thought there was agreement on the fundamental point, that the tone of
                            the American press would change for the better as the evidence of
                            military success became clearer. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said he understood Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>’s remarks to mean that both the
                            Vietnamese and United States Governments should relax about the press
                            stories and live with the criticism gracefully until our success solves
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that the
                            existence of press scrutiny, even though the reporting was critical, was
                            preferable to no press scrutiny at all. It was essential to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName>’s efforts to continue
                            his support of the winning program in Vietnam, that American
                            correspondents <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0538"/>be free to
                            scrutinize and criticize that program. The worst thing that could happen
                            was not bad reporting but the possibility that the reporters could be
                            made martyrs by being denied the right of scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said he could not
                            see how the correspondents could consider themselves martyrs. A country
                            which for twenty years had been involved in a hot war should not also
                            have to deal with a cold war waged against the Vietnamese Government and
                            people by their friends. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> said the calibre of American reporters was low.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said he agreed that
                            the President had reason to complain of the coverage his Government was
                            receiving but could not agree that the American correspondents were not
                            competent journalists trying to do a good job. It was necessary to
                            distinguish between being wrong and being evil. The correspondents may
                            be wrong but they are not evil nor are they maliciously motivated. The
                            Ambassador agreed. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> said that the American reporting has had a
                            deplorable effect on Vietnamese public opinion, and in a general
                            discussion, it was agreed that, in many ways, Vietnamese opinion was
                            more influenced by the American press than by the local Vietnamese
                            press.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said that some of
                            the reporting was insulting to the Army and it had a bad effect on Army
                            morale. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> suggested
                            that this effect would be overcome by the actual success of military
                            operations, but the President replied that the American correspondents
                            seemed unaware of any gains made in Vietnam. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, upon the President’s
                            instructions, was always ready to arrange for correspondents to cover
                            military campaigns but the correspondents were unwilling to accept the
                            offer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> suggested that some
                            very high <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> official should, from time
                            to time, have conferences with the correspondents to convey to them the
                            general situation and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> version on
                            matters of dispute. For instance, on the Buddhist problem, the
                            correspondents could not get access to an authoritative <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> official to discuss the matter. Thus,
                            they had the benefit only of the Buddhist version of events and the
                            Buddhist interpretation of the problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said that if the Government tried, on a day-to-day basis,
                            to deal with Buddhist complaints, this would simply prove Government
                            insincerity for it took time to investigate the complaints and know
                            where truth lies. The President stressed that all the Buddhist charges
                            did not have validity but that each charge would get a serious reception
                            and investigation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> stated that
                            sometimes the Vietnamese Government did respond quickly, and perhaps too
                            quickly, with its version of events. He cited the demonstrations at the
                            Giac Minh Pagoda yesterday. The Ambassador said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statement on this incident <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0539"/>was absolutely contrary to the
                            unanimous account given to the Ambassador by many eye-witnesses.
                            According to the eye-witnesses, the police, without physical
                            provocation, charged and badly mauled about 100 demonstrators including
                            women and children. Yet the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            statement issued several hours later said only that the demonstrators
                            attacked and injured eight policemen. This kind of thing completely
                            destroyed the credibility of statements by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> and its friends. President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> then criticized the inaccurate nature of the
                            reporters’ dispatches and gave several examples. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> repeated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> statement was in complete conflict with
                            eye-witness accounts and that the effect of such a statement was to
                            destroy the credibility of the accurate reports made from time to time
                            of genuine progress on the military side of the Vietnam war. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> again referred to the
                            inaccuracy of the reporting of the American correspondents. There was a
                            lengthy discussion in which the President indicated his conviction that
                            the American reporters were consistently irresponsible and unfair in
                            their criticism of the actions of the Vietnamese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> then reverted to his
                            previous suggestion that there was a great need for a high <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> official to give occasional background
                            conferences to the reporters. Such a conference would have the effect of
                            putting the correspondents under a kind of psychological obligation to
                            the news source. Even though the same information might be available
                            from a lower level official, it was good public relations policy that
                            the Government attitude from time to time be conveyed to reporters from
                            a really authoritative source. Otherwise a vacuum was created which was
                            usually filled by forces hostile to the Government. The President said
                            such conferences had been tried in the past but the Government was
                            disappointed at the results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that he had
                            discussed one problem in detail with Counselor <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> the previous day<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d227fn2">See <ref target="#d226">Document 226</ref>.</note>
                            but wanted to make the same point to the President. The American
                            correspondents feared that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might
                            inaugurate a policy of harassing and possibly expelling the
                            correspondents. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> had
                            been assured by Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and
                            others that this fear was a figment of the correspondents’ imagination.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> wanted to convey this
                            to the correspondents before his departure from Vietnam. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> asked if the President thought
                            this would be a useful thing to do.</p>
                        <p>The President said “Yes, but the correspondents should not put themselves
                            into a position where they would face expulsion.” The President said he
                            thought the correspondents’ fears stemmed from their own guilty
                            consciences about their own irresponsibility.</p>
                        <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>The President said again that the American reporting had had a deplorable
                            effect on opinion in America, and particularly in Vietnam. The behavior
                            of the correspondents was neither correct nor responsible considering
                            that Vietnam was at war and that the Government had accomplished so
                            much. The President said some people had told him that this kind of
                            unfair criticism was the kind of thing which had to be put up with
                            because Vietnam received foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said that whether or
                            not the reporting was deplorable, it should be remembered that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJE1">Kennedy</persName> still had public
                            support for his policy of helping Vietnam win its war. The reporting has
                            not changed that. The reporting was not one-tenth as harmful in its
                            effects on American public opinion as would be an attempt to expel or
                            harass the reporters. Such a policy would make martyrs of the reporters
                            and would deprive President <persName corresp="#p_KJE1"
                                >Kennedy</persName> of the essential tool which he needs. The
                            American involvement in the Vietnam war is a new type of experience for
                            the American people and the United Sates Government has been both
                            surprised and pleased with the mature way that the public has accepted
                            the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said
                            that the present kind of reporting was something which we could live
                            with.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> responded that the
                            erroneous reports must inevitably have a bad effect on American opinion.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> agreed but said it
                            was necessary to choose between bad effects. The harassment or expulsion
                            of the reporters would have an immeasurably worse effect than would the
                            mere continuation of the present critical reporting. There was then a
                            general discussion concerning Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName>’s hope that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would publicly take personal
                            charge of the Buddhist crisis. The President did not commit himself.</p>
                        <p>There was a lengthy discussion of the progress being made by the
                            Vietnamese Government in its various economic and social programs. The
                            President said that the progress of these programs proved conclusively
                            that the war was being won.</p>

                                of July 18 strikes us as forthright and statesmanlike. It reaffirms
                                in unmistakeable terms the government’s intention to carry out in
                                letter and in spirit the agreement of June 16. And it provides a
                                mechanism whereby any complaints about implementation can be
                                amicably settled with the participation of the Buddhists themselves.

                            it will help me to move <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and to

                                    barricades removed from all pagodas, and bonzes were permitted
                                    to return to their pagodas, but could not congregate at Xa Loi
                                    Pagoda. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> noted
                                    that he had urged the government to go beyond those steps and
                                    release those jailed following the July 17 demonstration, offer
                                    compensation to those injured by police on July 17, and
                                    establish the practice of handling future demonstrations by
                                    non-forceful means if possible. South Vietnamese officials with

                                    felt that President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                    was now moving in the right direction on the Buddhist issue, and

                            most uncertain and volatile situation.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us that outcome remains obscure: We do not know whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> really will do the
                            things he must if his regime is to survive. We therefore inclined
                            continue for present public posture of noninterference this internal
                            affair, neither favoring Buddhists or <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> in public statements, but merely expressing
                            approval all helpful steps and hope for peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>At same time we think it essential to continue press <persName

                            statements designed to meet squarely Buddhists’ legitimate grievances.
                            We much encouraged by progress you have registered to date and hope you
                            can prevail on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to insure
                            removal barricades around pagodas, release those arrested during
                            Buddhist demonstrations, and pay compensation to those injured. These
                            Buddhist demands seem reasonable even if motivated by political <pb

                            be essential if moderates are to regain control Buddhist movement and if
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is to rally sufficient
                            support to reestablish stability.</p>
                        <p>For above reasons we made text of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> broadcast available to newsmen today and commented

                            write to you directly about the situation in Vietnam. Here in brief is
                            the way it appears to me: <list>

                                <item>The highly contradictory nature of reports from South Vietnam
                                    is largely the result of a paradox: while the military situation
                                    is steadily improving, the political situation is rapidly
                                    deteriorating. Thus those who concentrate on military
                                    developments are optimistic while those who focus on the
                                    political aspects are gloomy. This state of affairs cannot
                                    continue indefinitely. If the political situation is not vastly
                                    improved, our ability to control the Viet Cong situation is
                                    almost certain to deteriorate.</item>

                                <item>Our mission in Saigon is on the edge of severe demoralization.
                                    The bitter conflict between the U.S. press and our mission is
                                    symptomatic. The morale of our military people, particularly the
                                    junior ones who are dealing with the military situation in the
                                    field, is high and they appear to be putting on an extraordinary
                                    performance. The same <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0545"
                                    />is true in the aid program. As you move further up the scale
                                    of authority, however, you encounter increasingly emotional
                                    differences and antagonisms.</item>

                                        as <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his
                                        family run Vietnam. I met no one who was in a position to
                                        judge the attitudes of the Vietnamese people who did not
                                        stress this fact.</p>
                                    <p>My own impression of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                            >Diem</persName> was that of a man quite remote from
                                        reality. For three hours and fifty-two minutes he gave me
                                        his version of what was happening in the country—a version
                                        which on key questions was inaccurate or distorted, and with
                                        respect to the U.S. not only misinformed but insulting.</p>
                                    <p>In <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his
                                        family we have a set-up comparable to that presented by the
                                        Generalissimo in China in the 1940’s. We failed in China
                                        largely because we failed to find an effective means of
                                        dealing with an inept ruling power that had lost touch with
                                        the people. We will fail in Southeast Asia, and perhaps even
                                        more decisively, if we repeat this mistake in Vietnam.</p>
                                    <p>Although the risks in any political switchover are
                                        formidable, the risks of staying on dead center are, in my
                                        opinion, substantially greater. Nor am I impressed by the
                                        familiar argument that “there is no available successor”. It
                                        is not too much to say that almost any articulate,

                                        enabled him to take charge. However, it is defeatist in my

                                    <p>It would therefore appear likely that <persName

                                    some means of coming to grips with the deteriorating situation
                                    in southern Laos. For the last two years it has been my belief
                                    that the only feasible <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0546"

                                    Laos from the 17th parallel then moving north and west along the
                                    Mekong. In my opinion we now have very little time to lose in
                                    securing this crucial area. Although I hesitate from this
                                    distance to attempt to outline a specific program, my previous
                                    knowledge of the area and what I heard and saw on my recent

                                            <p>There is considerable doubt as to whether the Thais
                                                would agree to move unless we introduce at least a
                                                battle group of U.S. troops. However, in this first
                                                stage at least I suggest that every effort should be

                        <p>For two years (and longer), the U.S. has had to make hard choices here.
                            We have made them pretty forthrightly, and the more forthrightly we have
                            made them, the better they have panned out. On these hard choices,
                            clearly taken, we have helped build what is admittedly a much stronger
                            defense against Communist takeover than was thought possible. This has
                            been done despite inefficiencies and goofs on part <gloss

                        <p><gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has badly underestimated and
                            mishandled Buddhist problem. It may—although I do not think so—have
                            gotten out of hand, but at last <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> has come out with something that looks good (and
                            has already taken certain concrete actions to back it up), publicly
                            committing his government to a conciliatory course. We should by all
                            available means encourage the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in
                            this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s statement, and the
                            response to it, may offer the last opportunity to surmount this
                            difficulty and to get this effort back on the tracks. The Buddhist
                            response depends in great degree on U.S. official and press reaction.
                            (Their agitation and appeals are now directed apparently as much toward
                            Americans as toward Vietnamese.) I think the government’s offer is
                            sincere and that we can help them carry it out successfully. The
                            government’s position promises satisfaction on religious grievances. It
                            would be a pity if the scepticism reflected in <gloss
                                target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> were to increase Buddhist
                            scepticism and/or intransigence, and thus lose the opportunity to move
                            this problem towards solution.</p>
                        <p>I again recommend statement along lines previously suggested, which
                            certainly does not go overboard but would be effective, and possibly
                            decisive here.</p>

                            estimate which represents our present thinking: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We inclined anticipate further Buddhist demonstrations and
                                    resulting unrest, and believe more protest suicides should be
                                    expected. This view based on: (1) Continuing <gloss
                                        target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> failure act promptly enough to
                                    meet legitimate Buddhist grievances and to show true spirit of
                                    conciliation; (2) Belief that Buddhist protest movement likely
                                    become increasingly militant. Buddhists probably more and more
                                    inclined regard overthrow of regime as only possible solution,
                                    thus attracting growing support (and conversely) from other
                                    major elements plotting regime’s overthrow, particularly in
                                    armed forces.</item>

                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We also expect that Buddhist unrest and demonstrations will
                                    increasingly agitate urban populace, and that this agitation, to
                                    degree, may be expected extend to countryside also, with
                                    resulting slowdown in war effort.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>In these circumstances and in light growing crop of reports on
                                    coup plans, we judge odds favor attempted coup within next few
                                    months if not weeks.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Odds also seem to favor success of such coup, although we
                                    keenly aware of strong possibility the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                        >GVN</gloss> might still successfully weather Buddhist storm
                                    by combination conciliation and repression and that consequently
                                    coup attempts may fail or abort.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>In these circumstances, following courses seem open to us: (a)
                                    We can attempt actively influence events by public statements
                                    disassociating ourselves from <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                        >GVN</gloss> handling of Buddhist issue, with likely result
                                    being encouragement or even triggering of coup attempt. (b) We
                                    can go even further and seek directly to encourage certain
                                    military leaders seek “Constitutional solution” under <persName
                                        corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>. (c) Conversely, we can
                                    seek actively discourage coup plots by both high-level public
                                    statements of support to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                                    and private statements to Buddhist-s and potential coup leaders
                                    although this, like the above might have unpredictable results.
                                    (d) Finally, we can hold to present posture of watchful waiting
                                    while continuing privately to press <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                        >GVN</gloss> to demonstrate proper spirit and to take all
                                    necessary measures to finally resolve issue.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>On balance we continue be inclined favor last course for time
                                    being. More active role runs obvious risk of putting us in
                                    position of having backed loser, and even of prolonging crisis
                                    and increasing violence, with all bad effects on war effort that
                                    would flow from such error. We may well come to point where we
                                    would want to throw all our influence behind either <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or an acceptable
                                    alternative leader or junta (preferably Constitutional successor
                                    supported by military) in order to stabilize situation as
                                    rapidly as possible. But in light info now available to us here,
                                    we do not believe situation has yet jelled to that point. At

                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. Had a rather reassuring and
                            encouraging session with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            today. Discussed many subjects bearing on political situation here,
                            including attitudes of various <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials toward Buddhist problem, military attitudes bearing on
                            possible coup d’etat, and <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            own convictions and especially his control of government.</p>
                        <p>I found <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> in more sanguine
                            frame of mind than heretofore. He confirmed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, having finally adopted
                            conciliatory line toward Buddhist problem, was now confidently pursuing
                            that course. I asked whether he was being undercut from any quarter, or
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> expected such
                            undercutting. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> replied
                            that, at least for time being, all Cabinet ministers and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were lined up together on line
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had adopted. He said
                            disciplinary action taken against Lt. Col. Chieu (who had organized
                            yesterday’s S.D.C. Veterans’ demonstration against Buddhists) had been
                            ordered by <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> with approval of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, who wished it in first
                            place. I asked whether this demonstration had been ordered by anyone
                            above Lt. Col. Chieu. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            replied that insofar as he could discover it had not been, but was
                            Chieu’s own idea. He also said that at President’s request he had just
                            given orders to Ranger company which was planning pro-government
                            demonstrations against Buddhists (in retaliation for alleged Buddhist
                            manhandling of member of company distributing literature at Xa Loi
                            Pagoda) to refrain from any such action.</p>
                        <p>Remarking that these signs looked good, I asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> how we could help move this
                            problem along. I referred to Washington’s encouragement to date, to
                            talks with a number of other Mission heads here, all of whom agree that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is now on right line. I
                            urged specifically: (a) that explicit instructions be given to Minister
                            of Interior and through him to police re tolerant and gentle handling
                            any further Buddhist demonstrations; (b) that President continue to take
                            every possible initiative to demonstrate good faith and increase
                            perceptible trend in public opinion toward clarification this issue.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> remarked that he had
                            noted from talks with several U.S. newsmen that they were becoming more
                            balanced in reporting on this situation. (Perhaps it is more accurate to
                            say they are becoming somewhat disenchanted <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526"
                                facs="0552"/>with Buddhists.) He said he would speak to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> along suggested lines this
                            evening. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is now on trip in
                            provinces-second trip this week.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to leave with <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> a piece of paper<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">Not
                                found.</note> containing suggestions for another initiative on part
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>-namely to invite Thinh
                                <persName corresp="#p_TK1">Khiet</persName> to confer with him, and
                            in such public invitation, to express President’s own distress at loss
                            of life in Hue, his determination to prevent repetition and to
                            compensate insofar as possible for loss of innocent victims. I urged
                            that would not involve government’s assuming responsibility deaths, but
                            would transcend this point, in manner which could only redound to
                            President’s credit. It might also well break deadlock with Buddhists. At
                            least, such action would show government’s intent to meet 100 percent
                            religious grievances, leaving burden of proof on Buddhists if in fact
                            their aims are to overthrow government. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> seemed very receptive to this idea, took the paper
                            and promised to let me know if I could help sell it to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He was appreciative of our
                            continued support of line he had been advocating. He felt that
                            government had at last put itself in stronger position, and had a good
                            chance of weathering this storm. I believe he is sincere in this.
                            Nevertheless, there are obviously a number of explosive possibilities
                            which have not yet been defused-including further manifestations and
                            resulting police actions, human sacrifices, counter-propaganda
                            manifestations, etc.</p>
                        <p>I sounded <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> out on his
                            thoughts on possibility of military coup, factionalism and division in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself, about President’s
                            leadership. On all these points he was reassuring. I do not believe he
                            is ignorant of kind of reports reaching us (although I did not spell
                            them out). He seemed rather to discount them as more of same old stuff.
                            Specifically regarding <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that he had
                            apparently had a change of heart and is now supporting <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s conciliatory line. He said that
                            this might be attributed to recent talks that we have had together. He
                            also warned that it might not be permanent. On question regarding
                            President’s control of government, <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> was quite forthright, saying he felt <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, once he had reached a clear
                            decision, was very much in control of government and able to have his
                            decision carried out.</p>
                        <p>I do not attach too much significance to this conversation, as there are
                            many obvious pitfalls ahead, but I do believe it represents the
                            assessment of some one who is much less worried now than he has been in
                            the recent past. My own estimate of the chances of survival of this
                            government has risen accordingly.</p>

                                for an assessment of the whole picture. I moved into this opening

                                on the spot. He thought he could play out any problems on this score
                                and that he could have contact with, and come up with an assessment
                                of, both elements in and closest to the regime and those plotting

                            logical—for this situation. Without trying to spell out nuances of
                            difference between our respective analyses, perhaps it is sufficient I
                            feel that heat is slowly going out of this crisis and that this
                            government is quite likely survive this crisis, as it has many others in
                            past.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I also hold that, despite shortcomings of present <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, it is government which stands best
                            chance (as compared with realizable alternatives) of carrying to

                            putting all our eggs in one basket or alienating possible successor
                            governments or leaders, we should, I think, help, by all means
                            consistent with our own principles, to maximize this government’s
                            chances of survival.</p>
                        <p>Since transmission your message, atmosphere has perceptibly calmed, at
                            least on surface. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has at last gotten
                            itself into sound posture on religious issue and may be said to be “one
                            up” on Buddhists. In effect, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has
                            pledged and repledged itself to implementation June 16 agreement and has
                            offered Buddhists joint investigation any complaints on this score by
                            examination of records or on-the-spot investigations.</p>
                        <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0555"/>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pursues its initiative and avoids
                            actions inconsistent with its announced policy of conciliation, Buddhist
                            leadership may well find it best to settle on basis June 16 agreements
                            and more radical elements will then, I think, cease agitation.</p>
                        <p>Just how solution of Buddhist issue will affect coup plotting it is
                            impossible to say, but this is a threat which is always with us.</p>
                        <p>Thus for present I would advocate a course somewhere between para 5 (d)
                            and (c). Specifically, I think we should publicly welcome conciliatory
                            steps as they are taken by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and any
                            constructive steps taken by Buddhists, with view to encouraging more of
                            same and disabusing those Buddhist leaders whose aims appear to be
                                open-ended.<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">A marginal notation on the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName>, who had just returned
                            from a trip to Saigon, thought that the essence of the press problems
                            lay in getting more of the members of the press corps in that city in
                            frequent and meaningful touch with the “horse’s mouth”, i.e. the
                            Ambassador and other top U.S. officials. This was certainly not the best
                            press corps in the world <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0556"/>nor
                            the worst. It was divided between those who remained permanently in
                            Saigon and who tended to be somewhat in-bred and to suffer from
                            localitis and those coming in on trips from the outside who were more
                            seasoned and had better perspective. Key reporters among. the first
                            group were <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> of the New
                            York Times and the <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> correspondents. In the second group the
                            leading reporters were Keyes Beech, Pepper Martin of U.S. News and World
                            Report, and Jim Robinson of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> thought the main
                            aspect in removing the dissatisfaction of some of these correspondents
                            was to take them into our confidence more, give them an “in” feeling,
                            and invite them more often not only to ritualistic type functions but
                            specifically to say small dinners given by the Ambassador for Vietnamese
                            officials and leading personalities including perhaps one correspondent
                            at a time.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> indicated he
                            intended to do just that, that one of the first things he planned to do
                            was to have lunch with several of the key correspondents. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> said as a whole the
                            correspondents approved the program we are pursuing in Viet-Nam and
                            supported our effort there—though they were unanimous in despising the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime and in their
                            conviction that we could not win with it.</p>
                        <p>The impasse between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the
                            American press corps was well nigh insoluble. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> recent offers to have back-grounders with the
                            American press, laudable as this offer was on their part, would almost
                            certainly not result in changing the conviction of the correspondents
                            that the government is doomed. Yet Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName> thought that we should continue encouraging
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in this direction and to seek as
                            much contact with the correspondents as possible. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> indicated that he was well aware
                            of this whole problem and very concerned about it. He was also concerned
                            at the feeling among American intellectuals regarding the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government and had been harassed
                            by communications on their part advocating that we change our policy on
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. He thought it
                            likely he would try to return here after some six months in Saigon to
                            make several speeches to improve the domestic atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> suggested that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> may wish to
                            keep the present <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> team and the
                            press attache in Saigon who he thought were handling the situation well.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> agreed and
                            indicated he did not intend to make personnel changes in this area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> referred to Director
                            of Information Dang Duc Khoi who is under Civic Action Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName> and who he said was
                            very savvy. There had been some discussion in Saigon of sending Khoi to
                            New York to endeavor to correct editorial impressions there on Viet-Nam.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> thought this
                            suggestion had merit.</p>

                        <p rend="center">REPORT ON THE SAIGON PRESS SITUATION</p>
                        <p>The press problem in Viet-Nam is singular because of the singular nature
                            of the United States involvement in that country. Our involvement is so
                            extensive as to require public, i.e., press, scrutiny, and yet so hemmed
                            by limitations as to make it difficult for the United States government
                            to promote and assure that scrutiny. The problem is complicated by the
                            long-standing desire of the United States government to see the American
                            involvement in Viet-Nam minimized, even represented as something less
                            than in reality it is. The early history of the handling of the
                            situation is marked by attitudes, directives and actions in Washington
                            and in the field that reflect this United States desire.</p>
                        <p>The effect of these generally restrictive practices had the short-term
                            virtue of keeping the escalating American involvement in a low key in
                            the world and United States press. But a long-term result has been
                            serious deterioration in the credibility attached by American
                            correspondents to the information and assessments given to them by
                            United States military and political authorities in Viet-Nam, and to a
                            certain extent in Washington. Additionally, it can be argued that,
                            whatever the merit of those practices in earlier days of the involvement
                            in Viet-Nam, the public attitude in the United States has been mature
                            and unexcitable—so much so that earlier fears of reaction to American
                            casualties and other aspects of the program may be said to have been
                            exaggerated. This last point argues strongly for relaxation of some—but
                            not all—of the strictures still imposed on American press coverage of
                            the Vietnamese situation, and it argues for a more relaxed attitude on
                            the part of US officials to the reports and assessments of the US press.
                            This would do much to reduce the somewhat sullen Alice in Wonderland
                            miasma that surrounds the Vietnamese press situation, and it would help
                            to build a degree of mutual confidence and mutual credibility between
                            American authorities and American correspondents covering Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0558"/>
                        <p>The absence of this confidence and credibility lies close to the core of
                            the press problem as it appears on the conclusion of a four-day mission
                            to Saigon. The situation is a troublesome one, and it is unlikely to
                            evolve into a happy one. There are, however, possibilities of
                            improvement. The basic problem will be removed as a critical factor in
                            the US operations in Viet-Nam only by time and decisive <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> victory over the Viet-Cong. But it can
                            be ameliorated.</p>
                        <p>First, a look at the parties involved:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="strong">1. The American
                            Correspondents</hi></p>
                        <p>The Saigon press corps consists of a dozen Americans, mostly staffers but
                            some (Time, Newsweek) stringers. These are augmented by periodic visits
                            by Far Eastern correspondents from the Tokyo, Hong Kong or New Delhi
                            bureaus of <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss>, UP, the networks and major
                            US publications. With two exceptions those we talked to at length were
                            regularly stationed in Saigon. It became apparent that, save for a
                            higher intensity on the part of the locals, the locals and the periodic
                            visitors share generally similar views and assessments of the press
                            situation. The local correspondents verge on unanimity also in their
                            assessments of the Vietnamese government, the effectiveness of <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-US military and political programs and
                            the virtues or shortcomings of the American involvement and American
                            officials. The periodic visitors may differ somewhat with many of the
                            locals’ assessments, but for practical purposes they differ chiefly in
                            degree only.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the visit to Saigon, the correspondents were concerned
                            with their own safety and ability to operate, almost to the exclusion of
                            problems of access and other relations with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> and US officials. Several maintained in fact that they
                            feel able to get all the information they need (a statement which many
                            will probably qualify once their concern over the recent roughing-up by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> police fades away).<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d239fn2">See <ref target="#d210">Documents 210</ref> and
                                    <ref target="#d211">211</ref>.</note> The main burden of their
                            several hours’ discussion was a desire for assurances that they could
                            continue to work in Viet-Nam without threat of physical or technical
                            harassment, or the threat of expulsions by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss>. They were more scared than hurt by the fracas with
                            police on July 7. Reporters covering the South have had rougher
                            experiences. But the problem goes deeper than the matter of these
                            fears.</p>
                        <p>The correspondents reflect unanimous bitterness toward, and contempt for,
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. They
                            unanimously maintain that the Vietnamese program cannot succeed unless
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime (cum family) is
                            replaced; this conviction, though it does not always appear in their
                            copy, underlies all the reports and analyses of the correspondents</p>
                        <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0559"/>
                        <p>The correspondents profess to have little faith in the information or
                            guidance they are given by top officials of the US Embassy, and they
                            treat with disdain what they believe to be the over-optimism of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> and his top command.
                            Where US officials maintain that the military program is making decided
                            progress, and the strategic hamlet program is developing favorably, the
                            correspondents maintain either the direct opposite—that the situation is
                            retrogressing—or, that the situation is little better than a stalemate.
                            Some correspondents go so far as to charge that they are systematically
                            lied to by US officials. All of them maintain that to get what they
                            consider to be “straight facts” on given operations, battles or
                            situations (e.g., how well the Vietnamese fight), they have to go to
                            lower echelons in the field. However justified these attitudes and
                            allegations (I believe many are exaggerations), their very existence
                            deserves to be recognized and attacked as a major obstacle to a healthy
                            information situation in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Beyond their own treatment at the hands of US officials, the newsmen
                            generally feel that US officials have become so committed themselves to
                            “winning with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>” that their
                            own official reporting is subject to serious question. This finds many
                            of the correspondents convinced that their own assessments represent a
                            more authoritative and more realistic picture than is being given to
                            Washington by its own representatives. One need not agree with this view
                            of correspondents in order to suggest that it must change before we can
                            expect healthy press relations in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Amid these many unpleasant facts about the correspondents’ state of mind
                            sits a most important and encouraging fact: <hi rend="strong">They seem
                                to agree to a man that the US involvement in Viet-Nam is a necessary
                                free world policy and that the programs, military and political, are
                                basically necessary and feasible.</hi> Without this, the situation
                            would be discouraging to the extreme; with this belief on the
                            correspondents’ part, there is much to build on. Where they disagree is
                            in questions of assessment of the progress and, more precisely to the
                            point, the wisdom of continuing to rely for the program’s execution on
                            the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime.</p>
                        <p>From all of this, it is obvious that the correspondents place much faith
                            in their own abilities to report and assess a situation that is as
                            complex and as tricky as any in the world today. Is such
                            self-confidence, coupled as it is with considerable disdain for the
                            official assessments, justified?</p>
                        <p>The local correspondents for the most part are young and of limited
                            experience. There are some more seasoned correspondents among the
                            periodic visitors and this, combined with their ability to get frequent
                            relief from the confines of Viet-Nam, often produces more balanced
                            reports of the fighting and the political situation. The locals seem for
                            the most part to be given to quick-rising emotionalism, and <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0560"/>they unquestionably are severely
                            afflicted with “localitis,” the disease which causes newsmen long
                            assigned to the confines of one given situation to distort perspective
                            by over-concentration on their own irritations, adventures and
                            opinions.</p>
                        <p>This group contains no journalistic giants, though at least one is very
                            promising and several are obviously bright men. And I would say that all
                            are decent, patriotic Americans who are striving to do credit to
                            themselves and their profession. The personal manners of some vis-a-vis
                            the Viet-Nam officials leave something to be desired, and they suffer
                            the common newspaper tendency to let the immediate dominate the long
                            view.</p>
                        <p>As an overall assessment of the correspondents, I am inclined to accept
                            the following opinion of <persName corresp="#p_MJ1">John
                                Mecklin</persName>, US Public Affairs Officer in Saigon: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The American newsmen working here are as good or better than the
                                    average in such boondocks assignments. They are exceptionally
                                    hard-working; they manage to stay on top of the news despite
                                    extraordinary handicaps; they are unafraid to face frequent
                                    personal danger; and they must work under conditions of notable
                                    emotional stress. Their reporting has thrown light on the
                                    sordid, bitter depths of the situation here which would not
                                    otherwise be generally known, thus in effect forcing a healthy
                                    confrontation between the American people and the reality of
                                    this kind of big power responsibility. This has inevitably
                                    complicated US operations in Viet-Nam, but ironically it has
                                    also reinforced US efforts to persuade the <gloss

                                    actions by providing the argument that US public opinion cannot
                                    be ignored.</p>
                                <p>“The newsmen have often been accused of ‘irresponsibility.’ In
                                    general, I don’t think this is either accurate or fair, though
                                    there have been some damaging errors. There have been numerous
                                    occasions when the reporters have deliberately withheld
                                    information that would have damaged the US interest; e.g., a
                                    number of shabby incidents between American military personnel
                                    and Saigon police, and the case some months ago of a homosexual
                                    American civilian official who was attacked and seriously
                                    wounded by his Vietnamese partner. The newsmen have, however,

                                    basic issue: that just as the US will not attempt to unseat a
                                    sovereign government, however tempting, so it cannot engage in a
                                    semi-covert struggle such as this except in the full glare of
                                    the free American press.</p>
                                <p>“This is a reality which had been widely overlooked in developing
                                    the US advisory role here. It will be equally important if and
                                    as the US is obliged to engage in similar efforts elsewhere. How
                                    to handle it hopefully, should be one of the major ‘lessons
                                    learned’ in Vietnam.”</p>

                        <p>The bitterness and contempt displayed by American correspondents for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his top
                            officials (especially for Counselor and <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1"

                            that the American correspondents are “Communists” or “as bad as
                            Communists.” The government says (and, I believe, has become convinced)
                            that the newsmen are chiefly concerned with bringing about the downfall
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government. “These
                            young reporters want nothing less than to make a new government,” said
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> bitterly in my
                            talk with him. “This is an exalting ambition, a stimulating pastime for
                            three or four of them to get together to overthrow a government and
                            create another.” (Please see attached memos of conversations with

                        <p>More perhaps than American officials on the scene, the Vietnamese see the
                            American press in Saigon (and back home in the US) as an important
                            political factor, one that can in fact play a large role in altering or
                            even undermining the American commitment to Viet-Nam. Believing this,
                            and believing that the correspondents are eager for <persName

                            deliberately cooperating with and encouraging any and all political
                            opposition—such as the Buddhist protests—as a means of achieving said
                            overthrow.</p>
                        <p>Extremely sensitive to personal criticism, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and his relatives take particular affront at the
                            kind of personal references that enter (inevitably, in view of the
                            autocratic family role) into much American reporting. While on the one
                            hand reacting by expelling correspondents who displease them (both
                            expulsions, of <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Francois Sully</persName> of
                            Newsweek and James Robinson of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>, were
                            for stories dealing with family personalities), <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> officials talk of needing “public relations advice” to
                            improve their image with the American public. They have plainly given up
                            hope of achieving any of this improvement through an improvement in
                            relations with the correspondents stationed in Viet-Nam, and talk
                            somewhat wishfully of trying to reach over their heads to editors and
                            editorial writers in the United States. They are insistent that the
                            American correspondents willfully refuse to talk with officials or
                            recognize facts that tell the favorable side of the Vietnamese story.
                            (On the other hand, correspondents say that when they try to talk with a
                            Vietnamese official they get either lies or lectures.)</p>
                        <p>In talks with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and <persName

                            bitterly resigned to the conviction that the newsmen are incorrigible.
                            For our part, we believe that the point was clearly made that the United
                            States cannot guarantee its ability to maintain its full effort in
                            Viet-Nam if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, by expulsions or

                            been given to American correspondents, and visiting US officials and
                            legislators, by officials of the Vietnamese government. Said <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> with a wan sneer: “All conditions
                            are favorable for a complete US change of policy in Viet-Nam. It is a
                            great opportunity and it would be a tremendous sacrifice for those
                            hostile to the (Diem) government to give up this opportunity.”</p>

                        <p>The senior American officials of the Embassy and MAC/V view the
                            correspondents with a distaste that is difficult to conceal. They
                            consider most of the correspondents young, immature and irresponsible.
                            Some consider that the correspondents’ criticism of and opposition to
                            the American effort in Viet-Nam transgress the line between journalistic
                            independence and patriotism. They consider the correspondents’ behavior
                            toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US officials to be
                            sometimes rude, insulting, and insufferable. There is some justification
                            for the above views, but the fact remains that the responsibility for
                            the gulf between the correspondents and the senior American officials is
                            something the two groups share.</p>
                        <p>To put it bluntly, the senior US officials have not been good enough in
                            their handling of the press. Although they devote perhaps more time and
                            effort than any post in the world to press problems, their contacts with
                            the press often serve to make the situation worse. The major cause for
                            this is the complete difference in the official and the correspondents’
                            assessment of the situation, but another serious cause is the reluctance
                            of the official family to treat the press with candor. Background
                            information is, apparently, almost never given. A too determined effort
                            is made to give a rosy picture, with the result that the correspondents
                            consider themselves to have been lied to. In short, the correspondents
                            are viewed as a nuisance and an inconvenience to be endured, not as a
                            valuable tool.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy’s instincts are to keep from the press all but the most
                            transparently desirable stories. Thus the Embassy either refuses to talk
                            about, or is disingenuously selective in its information, about even
                            minor stories which might prove unhelpful to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> or to the US effort in Viet-Nam. Faced with a
                            passionately hostile press corps, the Embassy is entitled to sympathy
                            for its wariness in dealing with the correspondents. But the result of
                            its efforts has been the complete destruction of the Embassy’s
                            credibility.</p>
                        <p>Senior US officials should not be condemned for the situation which
                            exists. It was in part inherited and in part predestined by the
                            unrealistic policy directives under which they were forced to deal with
                            the press until recently. Finally, they are dealing with an almost <pb
                                n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0563"/>unique public relations problem
                            which grows out of the almost unique nature of the American involvement
                            in Viet-Nam and the peculiar nature of the Vietnamese government. No
                            one—until recently—has realized how essential a role the press would
                            play in our policies in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, it has now become essential that the Embassy recognize the
                            press as what it is-an independent and important separate force bearing
                            upon both the political situation in Viet-Nam and the all-important
                            matter of domestic support in the United States for the American
                            involvement in Viet-Nam. Unless I am mistaken, one element in the
                            present hostility between the press and the Embassy is wounded ego on
                            the part of the correspondents who have a highly developed sense of
                            importance. The Embassy certainly possesses the diplomatic skill and
                            maturity to bring the correspondents at least partly into a deeper sense
                            of participation. It requires only that the correspondents be viewed and
                            treated as politically important individuals, rather than as a group of
                            socially objectionable and professionally incompetent young cubs.</p>

                            confidence of top officers and the fullest access to important Embassy,
                            MAC/V and intelligence information. He, too, has been severely
                            handicapped by the restrictive regulations imposed from Washington and
                            by the tendency of his superiors to over-caution. It is likely that the

                            with officials in the field. He also has obviously close and friendly
                            contacts with many Vietnamese officials and has had considerable direct
                            contact with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName

                        <p>The Buddhist controversy in Viet-Nam is pertinent to this report for two
                            reasons. First, an incident growing out of the controversy inspired the
                            visit to Saigon. Second, the controversy itself demonstrates the direct
                            and potentially influential role that correspondents on the scene can
                            play in the execution of a foreign policy. The Buddhist activities,
                            however genuine their original religious motivation, <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0564"/>have evolved into political activities
                            aimed at the overthrow of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> government. The Buddhist activists, and whoever on
                            the Viet-Nam scene is encouraging or supporting them, premise their
                            potential effectiveness to a large extent on exploitation of the
                            American correspondents. With a press agent’s flair, Buddhist leaders
                            take pains to notify newsmen in advance of processions or other
                            activities. They count heavily on word and photo coverage to keep the
                            issue alive, and to extend and illustrate the evident unwillingness of
                            the American government to condone <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s handling of the crisis, thus separating <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the US.</p>
                        <p>In view of the correspondents’ hostility to the government and in view of
                            their concentration on spot news, the anti-government activists sense
                            that the newsmen are predisposed to give full play to the
                            demonstrations, the Buddhist grievances and the government’s
                            countermeasures.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, on the other hand, knows full
                            well that its life is at stake, and considers the American

                            attempt to bring down the Government. Despite the correspondents’
                            complaints of Embassy indifference, there is little doubt that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have moved against the
                            correspondents some time ago were it not for the cloak of sanctity which
                            they wear because of their nationality and the representations made on
                            their behalf by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is belatedly attempting to deal
                            helpfully with Buddhist complaints. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> is attempting to stave off the religious issues and to
                            do this in such a way as to make it clear to all that subsequent
                            demonstrations are political. The success of this effort is
                            problematical, among other reasons because the American correspondents
                            are apt to be sympathetic and understanding to opposition efforts to
                            keep the crisis alive.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy implies (and Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_HIEU1">Hieu</persName> explicitly told my
                            Special Assistant) that subsequent demonstrations will be put down “with
                            brutality if necessary”. At that point, Vietnamese and world opinion
                            must either accept the Government’s version of events, which is
                            unlikely, or the crisis will continue to grow in intensity. The American
                            correspondents may well be the prime determinants of opinion-and they
                            are hostile to the Government.</p>
                        <p>It is unlikely that the crisis can be settled without considerable
                            violence. It is still possible the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            will decide that it cannot be settled unless some way is found to
                            moderate press coverage of the situation. If the crisis is not settled,
                            the Government will probably fall.</p>
                        <p>Ironically, this crisis comes at a time when US and <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials are convinced that we have
                            turned the corner in our efforts to defeat Communist subversion. There
                            is general agreement that the Strategic Hamlet program is the answer,
                            and that progress, although still spotty, <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539"
                                facs="0565"/>is real. According to the official assessment (with
                            which the correspondents passionately disagree) we need only keep the
                            political situation under control in order to reap significant and
                            lasting successes from our present effort. Yet, all agree that the
                            present crisis can easily undo the progress made thus far, and seriously
                            reduce if not destroy the prospects for early success.</p>
                        <p>Thus, even though there can be no great improvement in relations between
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the press, an improvement in
                            relations between the US press and the Embassy-MAC/V has become an
                            exigent requirement of American policy in Vietnam, both for reasons of
                            domestic US public support and, if it is desired, for the immediate
                            survival of the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> government
                            in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Usefulness and Accomplishments of the Mission</p>
                        <p>Despite some initial doubts, I am now convinced that the mission was
                            timely, necessary, and useful. The accomplishments were as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. It was made completely clear to the three highest officials of the
                            Vietnamese Government that continuing scrutiny and criticism by the
                            American press of the American involvement in Viet-Nam constituted an
                            absolute requirement of United States policy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and his principal advisors were
                            made to understand that free reporting from Viet-Nam (however
                            unfavorable it might be) was infinitely preferable to the situation in
                            which expulsion or physical harassment made martyrs of the pressmen.
                            Criticism of the Viet-Nam program was the essential ingredient to a
                            public debate on the merits of the program. Press scrutiny and criticism
                            enable the President to defend his program on its merits and
                            accomplishments. But such a defense would be effective and credible only
                            so long as free press scrutiny and criticism were allowed.</p>
                        <p>I believe <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and company
                            understand this argument and its validity. They have no reason for
                            failing to understand the importance attached by the U.S. Government to
                            continuing free press scrutiny of the American involvement in
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>2. We received from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>,
                            Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> a virtual pledge
                            against harassment of correspondents. The value of this pledge is
                            tempered by the fact that the correspondents are so passionately opposed
                            to the Government, and could conceivably engage in activity so clearly
                            upsetting or insulting as to leave the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> little alternative but expulsion. Barring such activity
                            on the part of the pressmen I think it unlikely that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will undertake either harassment or
                            expulsion of correspondents.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0566"/>
                        <p>There remains, however, the possibility of inadvertent contact between
                            police and U.S. correspondents in the event of further street violence
                            with the Buddhists, and such a clash—even though accidental—could revive
                            fears that correspondents are in danger. I would not predict calmness on
                            the part of correspondents were this to happen.</p>
                        <p>3. We obtained the permission of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            for the readmission to Viet-Nam of <gloss target="#t_NBC1">NBC</gloss>
                            Correspondent Robinson. His actual re-entry took place prior to our
                            departure from Viet-Nam. This action served not only to moderate the
                            passion of the correspondents and to improve the tone of the moment, but
                            also served to underline the fact that the U.S. Government has both the
                            intention and some capability of protecting legitimate interests of the
                            correspondents in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. We reduced substantially the fear of the correspondents for their own
                            physical safety. Although their concern was probably exaggerated, the
                            correspondents genuinely feared, upon our arrival, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had embarked upon a deliberate campaign
                            of harassment and intimidation which, some of them maintained, might
                            well culminate in either the savage beating or actual death of one or
                            more correspondents. The correspondents’ reaction to their fear was
                            embittered determination not to give in, and passionate resentment of
                            what they considered the Embassy’s inability or unwillingness to give
                            them protection.</p>
                        <p>The correspondents now at least partly recognize that the atmosphere is
                            changed and the physical harassment by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> is unlikely.</p>
                        <p>5. We received a pledge from Counselor <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> to try background briefings with selected groups of
                            the correspondents. Such meetings, if they go well, could contribute
                            toward filling the vacuum which now exists in regard to authoritative
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presentations of policy and
                            interpretations to the American pressmen. With uncertain results, we
                            pressed President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> to hold
                            similar meetings occasionally with individual American pressmen. The
                            Times correspondent is now seeking a Presidential appointment.</p>
                        <p>6. During the visit, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agreed to
                            drop the charges against two correspondents of assaulting Vietnamese
                            police. (<persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> had this in
                            train before our arrival.) Similarly, we were able to get the American
                                <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> correspondent, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM1">Browne</persName>, to agree to drop his own charges
                            against the Vietnamese police. This issue now seems dead.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, and importantly, the visit gave the American correspondents a
                            chance to blow off steam and to voice their own views to a receptive
                            official American audience. How lasting the benefits may be of this
                            psychological release will depend on an improved public relations
                            program in Viet-Nam, but there is no question that there has been a
                            temporary improvement in the atmosphere.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"/>
                        <p rend="center">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>1. That the President direct that the occasional meetings on Viet-Nam
                            between the President’s Press Secretary and the principal information
                            officers of State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            undertake on a regular basis to give centralized, professional and
                            authoritative direction to the effort to improve U.S. public relations
                            in connection with our involvement in Viet-Nam. The Group should, at an
                            early date, formulate new and comprehensive guidance applicable to all
                            elements of the U.S. involvement in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Justification: An improvement in relations between Embassy-MAC/V and the
                            press corps in Saigon has become an exigent requirement of U.S. policy
                            in Viet-Nam. The present relations are poisonous, and an improvement
                            will require continuing leadership and momentum from Washington of the
                            type that can only be given by an inter-Departmental authority.</p>
                        <p>Without such leadership, a substantial improvement is not likely.
                            Professional diplomatic and military minds find it difficult to accept
                            and even more difficult to deal with a situation in which public
                            relations must take precedence over all but the gravest military and
                            diplomatic requirements. Without centralized direction, the requirements
                            of military security, the privacy of diplomatic negotiations, and
                            protocol and procedural considerations will continue to dilute and
                            frustrate the effort to improve relations between the press and the
                            official family in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>It is not intended that major substantive decisions should be shaped to
                            meet the need of public relations. But it is imperative that the
                            requirements of an improved public relations program no longer be
                            subordinated to and thwarted by routine diplomatic and military
                            procedures and considerations.</p>
                        <p>2. That Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s
                            arrival in Saigon be used to involve the correspondents as participants
                            in a reassessment of the real situation in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Justification: At the present time there is an unbridgeable gap between
                            the official and the correspondent’s assessment of the Vietnamese
                            situation. The officials believe that the war is showing great progress
                            and that success is predictable if the political situation can be kept
                            in hand. The correspondents believe that the program is stalled, that no
                            progress is being made, and that no success is possible so long as the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government is in power.
                            In the present situation no dialogue is possible between the two parties
                            for each dismisses with contempt the views of the other.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s arrival
                            presents an opportunity to get before the correspondents in credible
                            form the evidence upon which the official views are based. It also
                            affords an opportunity to bring the <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542"
                                facs="0568"/>correspondents into the official family in a sense, by
                            giving them a purposeful opportunity to present to senior American
                            officials their own views and information.</p>
                        <p>The mechanics for doing this should be Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s reassessment, for his own
                            purposes, of the situation. He can tell the correspondents that he is
                            aware that their assessment is in conflict with the official one, and
                            intends to arrive at his own assessment through an examination of all
                            the facts available including their own. He can seek their assistance,
                            and thus possibly involve them in a reassessment of their own. The
                            correspondents in Viet-Nam are sincere and deeply committed to the
                            success of the U.S. effort to thwart Communist subversion. If they can
                            be brought to consider the evidence of progress it is not credible that
                            their views would not be influenced and moderated thereby. Moreover, the
                            correspondents have sources and information of their own, more knowledge
                            of which would doubtless be useful to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>3. That a concerted effort be undertaken to obtain the publication in a
                            broad range of U.S. periodicals of authoritative articles on the
                            situation in Viet-Nam. These articles should stress the exciting end
                            unique nature of the U.S. involvement in Viet-Nam and the appositeness
                            of the effort to the Communist penchant for victory by subversion.
                            Classified information should be made available as necessary to ensure
                            that these articles reflect both the difficulties and the progress which
                            characterize our effort.</p>
                        <p>4. No effort should be made to underplay or hide the magnitude of the
                            U.S. involvement and casualties in Viet-Nam. In the first place, the
                            effort will certainly fail in the end. In the second, as stated before,
                            the reaction of American public thus far to news of U.S. casualties has
                            been remarkably mature. Thirdly, there is even a chance that U.S. public
                            support for the effort in Viet-Nam will be enhanced, not lessened, by
                            the knowledge of American sacrifices made in this struggleÄ providing
                            the unhealthy political situation in Saigon is cured. Finally, any
                            attempt to disguise the American casualties or involvement in Viet-Nam
                            will (as it has in the past) poison relations between Embassy-MAC/V and
                            the correspondents and ensure the failure of efforts to create a more
                            sympathetic and understanding press treatment of the U.S. effort in
                            Viet-Nam. Similarly, we should be more honest and outgoing with the
                            correspondents about our setbacks and our difficulties with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Our progress will become credible only
                            when our failures (which the correspondents know about anyway) are
                            admitted freely.</p>
                        <p>5. The American press, both here and in Viet-Nam, should be made aware
                            that the U.S. Government considers continuing press scrutiny and free
                            coverage of the U.S. involvement in Viet-Nam to be an absolute
                            requirement of American policy in Viet-Nam. The press <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0569"/>should be informed-on a background
                            basis-that this has been vigorously conveyed to the highest levels of
                            the Vietnamese Government, and that we have reason to believe that
                            American correspondents will be free from harassment and expulsion.</p>
                        <p>The press should be informed of the attitude of the Vietnamese Government
                            toward the American correspondents, and reminded that the unprecedented
                            support which the correspondents are receiving from the U.S. Government
                            makes it incumbent that their personal behavior toward the Vietnamese
                            Government and its officials be proper and circumspect. The U.S.
                            Government has used some of its currency with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in its effort to guarantee to the
                            press the right to report freely and honestly. We can succeed in this
                            effort only if the correspondents in Viet-Nam behave and report with
                            responsibility and reasonable objectivity and fairness. No one can
                            protect the press against retaliation for public and profane insults to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials. No one can protect
                            them against retaliation for participation in coup movements. No one can
                            protect them against retaliation for contemptuous behavior toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (e.g. refusing to accept
                            interviews with President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>

                        <p>6. A deliberate and calculated effort should be made to establish good
                            personal relations between senior Embassy-MAC/V officers and individual
                            correspondents. This effort should be pursued with the same tact and
                            skill that is used in establishing personal relationships with <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials.</p>
                        <p>At the present, the correspondents are too in-bred. Conscious of the
                            distaste and disapproval with which they seem to be viewed by senior
                            Embassy and some military officials, they respond with a passionate and
                            unanimous contempt of their own. They have formed a closed group,
                            cemented together by a sense of maltreatment from the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the Embassy. They have convinced
                            themselves that they are the only ones who know or will recognize the
                            truth about the situation in Viet-Nam. Any contrary views from
                            Embassy-MAC/V officials are dismissed as untruthful and deceitful.</p>
                        <p>It is essential that a useful dialogue be re-established and this can be
                            done if Embassy-MAC/V officers embark upon a concerted effort to woo
                            individual reporters.</p>

                                and, equally as important, inter-related in a political and
                                psychological sense. When Staley Mission first proposed in 1961,
                                many skeptical as to this approach as substitute for normal
                                bilateral negotiations. When completed, we all convinced results

                        <p>144. Some encouraging news and symptoms over past several days re
                            Buddhist problem-but also several perplexing developments.</p>
                        <p>Was assured yesterday by <persName corresp="#p_BVL1">Bui Van
                                Luong</persName> (Interior Minister) that government would use no
                            repressive measures against further Buddhist demonstrations, having
                            concluded that most people bored with Buddhist agitation and becoming
                            convinced that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proposals just and
                            sincere attempt settle religious problem. Thus he thought no real risk
                            in letting up on security measures. This checks with info received
                            independently from <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s
                            doctor, who told me that in his presence <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> had called Interior Minister, Colonel Y (secret
                            police chief), and Saigon Police Chief to instruct them not to use force
                            or arrests against Buddhist agitators or demonstrators. This may be
                            overly optimistic reading, but nevertheless instructions are along lines
                            we have been advocating. May be crucial in connection with big
                            demonstration planned by Buddhists for Tuesday, July 30, which is
                            seventh and final weekly memorial of <persName corresp="#p_QD1">Quang
                                Duc</persName>’s death. There has been much publicity about this,
                            with Buddhist appeals to shopkeepers and civil servants and others to
                            quit work and demonstrate. Self-sacrifice of <persName corresp="#p_BH1"
                                >Buu Hoi</persName>’s mother also forecast by her for this date.
                                (<persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> has not yet returned
                            to Saigon as expected and requested by government, and this is
                            disturbing.)</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            tells me that Buddhist leaders have semi-agreed to meet with government
                            commission on provisional basis (i.e., with no terms of reference set
                            and free to leave if they <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0573"/>don’t
                            like set-up) on July 31. <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> said
                            that in telephone talks his contact, a moderate Buddhist leader, said in
                            effect that they (Buddhist leaders) wanted to try one more wingding
                            before agreeing to sit down in joint sessions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> worried re outcome Tuesday’s
                            events, but unable persuade Buddhists to meet beforehand.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> tells me that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> couldn’t bring himself to invite
                            directly and publicly Tich Tinh Kiet to come to see him, but did send
                            word through <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> that he would
                            see him if requested. (This of course misses main point my
                            recommendation, but may nevertheless help some.)</p>
                        <p>Talked to <persName corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> about getting
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> back here quick, and
                            he agreed to send him another SOS. Said <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu
                                Hoi</persName> had heart condition which made it dangerous for him
                            to travel (somebody else said bad liver). I said I reckoned he’d have
                            worse than that if he didn’t come back soon.</p>
                        <p>Several members of government have assured me that, for present, nobody
                            seems to be trying to undercut policy of conciliation. However, one
                            report to contrary is that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            did order veterans demonstration, which he later repudiated (cannot
                            vouch for accuracy).</p>
                        <p>Finally, I have had serious word from Vice President, <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MAU1">Mau</persName> that <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> continues to receive reports (with some details) that
                            several official Americans are encouraging Buddhists to continue
                            agitation until <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> arrives
                            and U.S. pulls rug on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                            Disavowing again such nonsense (which my informants also discounted), I
                            am nevertheless taking measures to cut to essential minimum contacts of
                            American officials with Buddhists in pagodas (especially Xa Loi), and
                            investigating certain apparently unauthorized contacts, which may have
                            given rise to suspicions among many gullible people. One good reason for
                            doing so is possibility that Saigon police, already overstrained, may
                            come to put credence in such rumors, which would be bad. I shall lay out
                            facts fully to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> when I get them.</p>
                        <p>Atmosphere calm over weekend.</p>

                            Buddhists. In answer to direct question of whether he favors “crushing”
                            Xa Loi Pagoda or its inmates through any means (i.e. directly, or by
                            means of a coup d’etat or by a false coup d’etat), he said that he did
                            not favor any such move. On contrary, he is convinced, he said, that
                            government must continue to try to conciliate Buddhists, to make further
                            concessions, and to demonstrate to Vietnamese people and to world

                                >See <ref target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> He claimed that
                            he had been urging this course upon the <persName corresp="#p_THO1"
                                >Tho</persName> commission as well as upon <persName

                            keeping door always open for Buddhist participation. (I understand from
                            other sources that this is going to be done next week.) Nhu stated that
                            any other interpretation of Reuters dispatch was erroneous. I summarized
                            long discussion this point in approximately above language and told him
                            I was going to so report to my government. He said that this would be an
                            accurate report and a truthful statement of his position. He added that
                            this position represented a politically risky course in Viet-Nam, since
                            many people, including large segment of the Army, felt that it
                            represented weakness on the part of the government towards a movement
                            which was standing in the way of, if not actually subverting, the war
                            effort and victory over the Viet Cong. He nevertheless reiterated that
                            he would stand behind this policy, since he was convinced it offers the
                            best way out. I told him, as I have once before, that if he was telling
                            me the truth, he is a most misunderstood man. He replied that he knew he
                            was misunderstood, but I could rely on his word. The conversation was
                            direct but friendly.</p>
                        <p>Regarding <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu’s</persName> speech to
                            the Women’s Solidarity Movement, I told him that it was considered by my
                            government and myself, as well as by a number of Vietnamese with whom I
                            had spoken, as inflammatory and directly contrary to the President’s
                            policy of conciliation. I said that our own governmental, Congressional
                            and public opinion could not understand or accept the contradictions
                            between <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0583"/>the government policy
                            and her speech. I was sorry to say this but it was necessary if we were
                            to retain our present relationships. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> did not defend the content of his wife’s speech, but
                            defended at great length her right to make it as a private citizen who
                            “does not speak for the government”. I told him in all frankness that he
                            and the President could not expect this explanation to be accepted in my
                            country, and I thought not in Viet-Nam. He said nobody realized, for
                            example, that <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> had not
                            seen President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> for two
                            months, that he and his family do not have meals with the President
                            except on special occasions (under a mutually satisfactory arrangement),
                            that she is in fact a private citizen who, he insisted, has the right to
                            express her own views.</p>

                            I have asked on your behalf that the Defense Department review their
                            contingency planning for the protection and evacuation of Americans who

                            decision in the event an accident occurs.</p>
                        <p>No decisions are required from you at this time, but you may wish to give
                            some guidance during the next week when it becomes more clear what the

                            is impressed by gravity of situation confronting him, both internal and
                            external. When he told me that he would take seriously what I had said
                            and would consider what he could do to meet our demands, I told him this
                            was not enough—that time was running out and that he had promised me the
                            same last week. Since then the situation had been made much worse by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu’s</persName> intemperate
                            utterances. He then promised to let me know this afternoon what he would
                            do.</p>

                            read him <gloss target="#t_REFTEL1">reftel</gloss> word for word,
                            explained points and pointed out inter alia that we were now talking
                            about doubts and misgivings in US Government itself, not in US public
                            opinion. I drew heavily, perhaps exhaustively, on store of goodwill and
                            confidence, spoke absolutely frankly from point of view of partner in
                            joint enterprise, could detect no resentment but rather a great sense of
                            struggle between family loyalties and public duty. In this connection I
                            stressed to him that as President his family is entire Vietnamese people
                            and it must be their welfare which must prevail.</p>

                            most Cabinet opinion from conversations I have had separately with
                            nearly all of them. I gave President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> my own observations and convictions regarding the
                            attitude, not only of high officials of his own government, but of many
                            lower Vietnamese; stressed absolute necessity for him to take account
                            personally of the crisis resulting from Buddhist problem. I told him
                            that not only abroad, but here in Viet-Nam, it seemed clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName>, with the support
                            of his brother, was usurping his prerogatives and control in this matter
                            (he vehemently denied this) and that in my opinion and in that of my
                            government nothing would now eradicate that impression except vigorous
                            and positive public action by him, demonstrating his control over his
                            own government and repudiating <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame
                                Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I will report further after hearing from him.</p>
                        <p>Another point should be added: <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                                >Thuan</persName> (protect source) told me last evening that he was
                            convinced Madame Nhu had organized a secret police squad of her own,
                            headed by her brother, Tran Van Khiem, and that already “illegal
                            arrests” have been made by this group. I asked him whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was in on this and he said he found
                            it impossible to believe that he was not. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that I had received certain
                            unverified information to this effect. He flatly denied that there was
                            any substance to it, saying among other things that he disliked and
                            distrusted Khiem and that his family would never do such a thing. I told
                            him I thought he had better look into it.</p>
                        <p>Throughout discussion, there was evident on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s part a feeling that it was not so much what
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> said but how she
                            said it that gave him trouble. He reverted again and again to the bad
                            faith of the bonzes, to their sabotage of the war effort, etc. He also
                            mentioned the pressure he was under from “good people” in the provinces
                            and elsewhere not to knuckle under to the false monks. He complained
                            that nobody in the outside world recognized the falsity of the religious
                            issue or the fact that it was being used for subversive action. I told
                            him that what he had just said confirmed my suspicion that his policy
                            was in fact schizophrenic, that he had entrusted a policy of
                            conciliation to the Vice President to implement and was himself
                            condoning public attacks upon the Buddhists which made that policy
                            impossible to implement; that he had to choose and do so decisively;
                            that so far as the US was concerned he had to stick to and implement
                            fully the policy of conciliation, and had to make certain public
                            demonstrations that he was doing so. Otherwise, we could not support
                            him.</p>
                        <p>He said that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>
                            was scheduled to make a restatement of government policy tomorrow, and
                            that he expected, after talks with certain bonzes, that they would agree
                            to joint investigations of the events in Phan Thiet. I seized upon this
                            to press him most strongly <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0590"/>to
                            make that public declaration himself, in his own name and to take
                            advantage of this opportunity to subdue the rising tide of public
                            feeling, at home and abroad, that he is not master of his own
                            government. If he responds at all positively to our demarche, I think it
                            will be to make this declaration himself, as a first step.</p>

                            he had slipped back into postponement and vacillation, which he
                            attributed to Buddhist attacks (banners, etc. in Saigon) against him and
                            government and to attacks in US press, especially <hi rend="italic">New

                        <p>In face these factors, he said that Ministerial Council had advised him
                            not to issue another conciliatory statement. I told him bluntly that for
                            our part we could not accept this; I had given him before our reasons
                            and he had promised to take positive action explaining clearly
                            government’s position and, at least by implication, repudiating position

                            absolutely frank with one another. I drew heavily on reftels (minus last

                            maintained stoutly that neither the American press nor apparently the
                            American government understood the real dimensions or all complexities
                            of Buddhist problem, nor did we understand the true situation concerning
                            the Ngo family and their individual contributions to the independence of
                            Viet-Nam. He went into great detail on this, stressing particularly the
                            absolute selflessness of Ngo Dinh <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> contribution to the cause. I stuck to the position
                            it would be impossible for the US Government to continue our present
                            relationship to him and to his government if he did not promptly make a
                            declaration which would show clearly who was running the country, would
                            undo some of the damage done by <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame

                            policy of conciliation. Upshot finally was that he promised to make such
                            a statement, if possible before I leave tomorrow. We are working hard on
                            the follow up.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Diem’s statement was made to

                        <p>“b. The statement seems to do this well enough and, implicitly at least,
                            to rebuke Mme. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, but it takes
                            the form of an answer to a question from Marguerite Higgins for
                            publication in today’s Herald Tribune. Thus it could be disavowed if

                            picture of the Buddhist monk, Quang Duc, burning himself alive. I
                            suppose that no news picture in recent history had generated as much
                            emotion around the world as that one had. President <persName

                            the overall importance of Vietnam, and to what was going on in Saigon—to
                            the fact that apparently the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> government was entering a terminal phase. He also
                            mentioned the extremely bad relations that the Embassy had with the
                            press. He said, ‘I suppose that these are the worst press relations to
                            be found in the world today, and I wish you, personally, would take

                                    subject. Article 41 provides that for reasons of emergency the
                                    President may, between two sessions of the National Assembly,
                                    sign orders in council (meaning, presumably, that he can govern
                                    by decree). Article 42 provides that in case of emergency, war,
                                    internal disturbances or financial or economic crisis, the
                                    National Assembly may vote a law conferring on the President the
                                    power to sign orders in council for a definite time and within
                                    definite limitations, with a view to enforcing the policy
                                    defined by the National Assembly in the law by which it
                                    delegates power to the President. Article 42 says nothing one
                                    way or the other about whether the National Assembly could pass
                                    such a law in favor of a former President of the National
                                    Assembly who might be temporarily exercising the function of
                                    President of the Republic as prescribed under Article 34. In
                                    other words, the Constitution does not provide a mechanism under
                                    which a caretaker head of state may govern by decree although
                                    neither is forbidden.</item>

                                    himself so violently. In a conversation about two months ago, in

                                    destroyed. He repeated this statement several times and lent
                                    emphasis to it by resorting to the Latin “Carthago delenda est”.
                                    On many occasions in the past he has then qualified such remarks
                                    by saying that he views the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                        >Diem</persName> regime as a transitional stage and the

                                    nor to the American observer on 25 June did he express such an
                                    intermediate point of view. In general, <persName

                                    above. So far as the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (<gloss

                                    supported <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> thus
                                    far—even this statement must be qualified, however, by noting
                                    that it is a moot point whether the troops of the two divisions
                                    in Cao’s command would remain loyal to him. It thus follows that
                                    it would be as difficult to raise <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"

                                        >ARVN</gloss> commanders are certainly fully aware,

                                        Can</persName> involves a number of complexities. The two
                                    brothers have differed on many issues over the years and have
                                    constructed internal political organizations which frequently
                                    compete with one another on such matters as appointment to lower
                                    and medium level jobs and access to lucrative economic
                                    franchises. <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName>
                                    is again a factor, in that she and Can detest each other.
                                    Additionally, Can has often expressed a low opinion of <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> judgment and practical
                                    ability as a leader. Nevertheless, in a crisis involving
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> efforts to
                                    attain the Presidency, after—and only after—<persName
                                        corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>’s disappearance from the
                                    scene, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> could probably
                                    count upon Can’s assistance and would make strenuous efforts to
                                    obtain it. A large measure of Can’s power in Central Vietnam is
                                    derived from support from Saigon, and to retain that power over
                                    a long period, he must have continued support. Can would reason
                                    that with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> in office
                                    in Saigon, he would stand a better chance of continued support
                                    than he would from any other leadership. Can’s influence during
                                    a crisis period would be in a measure independent of Saigon, in
                                    that it is based upon a sense of identification with him on the
                                    part of provincial authorities, both civil and military, who
                                    obtained and hold their own positions with, at the very least,
                                    his concurrence. Can’s hold over his subordinates is not so much
                                    a matter of their loyalty to him as a realization on their part
                                    that without him they could very likely lose their own
                                    positions. In speculating upon Can’s relations with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, and his likely course of
                                    action if the latter makes a bid for power, past experience
                                    suggests that Can, in a crisis, cannot always be counted upon to
                                    play a rational role, even in terms of his own best interests.

                                            in the vicinity of Saigon. Whenever trucks are made
                                            available to one of the battalions for an operation, an
                                            armor unit is placed on alert. Recently armor units have

                                            and indications are that it might be willing to mount
                                            another. Many of the key officers participated in the

                                    the past year. This decline, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                        >Halberstam</persName> reported, occurred notwithstanding
                                    the previous 20 months of a U.S. build-up of South Vietnamese
                                    forces there. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName>
                                    noted that while the Delta comprised less than a quarter of
                                    South Vietnam’s land mass, it contained a majority of its
                                    population and resources. According to the <persName

                                    military sources stated that the Viet Cong moved large units of
                                    600 to 1,000 men into the Delta and were well armed with
                                    captured American weapons. Instead of attacking the paramilitary
                                    Self-Defense Corps or the Civil Guard, the Viet Cong now took on
                                    the regular Armed Forces of South Vietnam.</note> We, as well as

                            <item>This is easy, but misses a key point, which I feel may be of use
                                to you apart from our point-by-point analysis, which is coming. It
                                is this—Halberstam, in his comments on the temperature of the battle
                                in the Delta, exhibits a lack of understanding of our entire Vietnam
                                strategy. From the start, that strategy involved a purification
                                process, north to south; driving the Viet Cong southward—away from
                                their sources of strength and compressing them in the southernmost
                                area of the peninsula. This has proceeded. I Corps is fairly clean;
                                II Corps, not much less so; III Corps, warmer; and IV Corps, still
                                tough.</item>

                            <item>This was expected. The gradual redisposition of Vietnamese power,
                                from the less to the more critical areas, portrays this. As General
                                Cao, CG, IV Corps, said in June, “We want to see all the Viet Cong
                                squeezed into the Ca Mau Peninsula, and then rot there.”</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>If the conflict in Viet Nam is at least as important to us as it is to
                            the Vietnamese, then there is little room for manoeuvre in the present
                            situation. We are stuck with it and must stay with it whatever it may
                            take in the end in the way of American lives and money and time to hold
                            South Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>In such circumstances whether to support the present government or not is
                            the secondary or tactical question. It is the question, to state it
                            simply and frankly, of which way is likely to be least costly in
                            American lives and money. Indeed, the reports in the press suggest that
                            this is now the subject of intense discussion among the
                            agency-technicians. In any event, those in day-to-day command of
                            policies should be best qualified to advise on this question since they
                            will have to make the day-to-day decisions on operations which, in
                            effect, act either to bolster the present government’s position or to
                            encourage a replacement.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, the selection of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> for a principal role in these decisions is an
                            excellent one. The framework in which he is to make them ought to be
                            clear in his instructions. It ought to be made equally clear to all
                            concerned—Americans and Vietnamese alike—in Viet Nam and in Washington
                            that on behalf of the President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> is the man who will make the decisions and,
                            insofar as official Americans are concerned, their obligation is to
                            support his decisions fully and actively. If it is necessary to remove
                            personnel to make the point emphatic that should be done promptly.</p>
                        <p>However, it is necessary to face the fact that either way—with the
                            present government or with a replacement—we are in for a very long haul
                            to develop even a modicum of stability in Viet Nam. And, in the end, the
                            costs in men and money could go at least as high as those in Korea. This
                            is the reality of our situation, if we remain wedded to the premise that
                            South Viet Nam is at least as important to us as it is to the
                            Vietnamese. At this point, with the changing of Ambassadors, therefore,
                            it is pertinent to examine this present premise of policy. The die is
                            not yet finally cast but we are very close to the point when it will
                            have to be. Therefore, we may well ask ourselves, once more, not the
                            tactical question, but the fundamental question: Is South Viet Nam as
                                <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>important to us as the
                            premise on which we are now apparently operating indicates? Is it really
                            as important to us as it is to the Vietnamese themselves? Or have we, by
                            our own repeated rhetorical flourishes on “corks in bottles” and
                            “stopping Communism everywhere” and loose use of the phrase “vital
                            interests of the nation” over the past few years given this situation a
                            highly inflated importance and, hence, talked ourselves into the present
                            bind? In short, have we, as in Laos, first over-extended ourselves in
                            words and in agency programs and, then, in search of a rationalization
                            for the erroneous initial over-extension, moved what may be essentially
                            a peripheral situation to the core of our policy-considerations?</p>
                        <p>It would appear that there is, at least a presumption that such is the
                            case in Viet Nam and for the following reasons: <list>

                                <item>It is almost inconceivable that any policy for the defense of
                                    the United States in the Western Pacific would be based upon the
                                    commitment of hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans on
                                    the Asian mainland, where our naval and air power would be least
                                    effective; (Recall Eisenhower’s dictum: “Let Asians fight
                                    Asians”). Note, too, the decision not to pursue the conflict in
                                    Korea into Manchuria and beyond which was made as much by
                                    President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles in negotiating the
                                    truce, as it was by President <hi rend="italic">Truman</hi> and
                                    Mr. <persName>Acheson</persName> in initiating those
                                    negotiations. Are we now to find, at an enormous potential cost,
                                    “vital U.S. interests” in South Viet Nam when we did not find
                                    them in Korea?</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The most compelling argument for a vast commitment in South
                                    Viet Nam and Southeast Asia in terms of U.S. interests is the
                                    negative one of denying the resources of the region to Chinese
                                    domination and, thereby preventing China from solving its food
                                    and other resource-problems. This is an understandable argument
                                    but it presupposes a genuine common international interest in
                                    this objective. If such cooperation is not forthcoming, a real
                                    question arises as to the point at which the cost in men and
                                    money to the United States of essentially unilateral action to
                                    achieve the objective outweighs any possible advantage which it
                                    might provide to the security and welfare of this nation.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Certainly, there is no case for holding South Viet Nam on the
                                    positive grounds of commercial or other economic interests to
                                    this nation. We will be decades, at least, in recouping from all
                                    of Southeast Asia, in a commercial sense, what the attempt to
                                    hold Viet Nam alone has already cost the people of the United
                                    States, let alone what it promises yet to cost.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>What the above suggests is that the situation in Viet Nam is not “at
                            least of as much importance to us as it is to the Vietnamese” (the
                            present premise under which we are apparently operating) but that we
                            have talked ourselves and “agencied” ourselves into this premise. It <pb
                                n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0613"/>suggests that Viet Nam is not
                            central to our defense interest or any other American interest but is,
                            rather, peripheral to these interests. It suggests, further, that the
                            way out of the bind is certainly not by the route of ever-deeper
                            involvement. To be sure it is desirable that South Viet Nam remain free
                            of Communism but it is also desirable that we do not spend countless
                            American lives and billions of dollars to maintain an illusion of
                            freedom in a devastated South Viet Nam. And it is also desirable that we
                            do not find ourselves, militarily, so bogged down in South Viet Nam or
                            throughout Southeast Asia that we have few resources, short of nuclear,
                            for deployment elsewhere in other critical peripheral situations.</p>
                        <p>If we go back to the period prior to the first Geneva conference we may
                            find the clue to a valid premise of United States policy in South Viet
                            Nam which can be supported at a cost somewhat commensurate with our
                            peripheral national interests in the situation. We did not, at that
                            time, have even the remotest idea of becoming involved, as the French
                            were, with armies on the mainland of Southeast Asia. The most sanguine
                            proposal, as I recall, was for a one-strike aerial attack to relieve the
                            French garrison at Dien Bien Phu and, in the end, even that was rejected
                            by Mr. <persName>Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
                        <p>And when the civil war against the French finally came to an end, the
                            extent of our commitment was, at most, for financial and economic aid to
                            the successor non-Communist government in Saigon and, militarily if at
                            all, through S.E.A.T.O. which was thoroughly international in original
                            concept, if not in its subsequent evolution. It is this limited
                            commitment which has been agencied, through the years, to what is now
                            close to irrevocable total commitment.</p>
                        <p>In terms of specific U.S. interests, however, it would seem that any
                            premise for Vietnamese and Southeast Asian policy should bind us less
                            not more tightly now than it did at the outset of our involvement. A
                            reasonable premise for present U.S. policy might follow these lines:</p>
                        <p>We are concerned with the freedom of Viet Nam and the other nations of
                            Southeast Asia, as we are with freedom throughout the world. We join
                            with other nations, within and without the region, via the United
                            Nations or other international combinations in support of such social
                            evolution as these nations seek. But we do not propose to attempt,
                            unilaterally, on behalf of any government what it can only do for
                            itself; that is, to so conduct itself as to marshal its own peoples in
                            support of free political evolution. We reserve to ourselves the right
                            to determine when such circumstances exist and, hence, when to assist,
                            when not to assist, and when, if necessary, to withdraw assistance. In
                            the absence of responsible and responsive indigenous leadership or
                            adequate international cooperation in supporting social evolution in
                            freedom, the essential interests of the United States do not compel this
                                <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0614"/>nation to become
                            unilaterally engaged in any nation in Southeast Asia. Indeed, it is
                            doubtful that it is in the interests of the peoples of those nations
                            themselves, for the United States to become so engaged.</p>
                        <p>If this is the more valid premise for United States policy than the
                            present premise, then certain courses of action stem from it: <list>

                            to unidentified American military sources, the conclusion of Task Force
                            Saigon is that the overall military situation in the Mekong Delta area
                            has improved steadily during the past year, although at a slower rate
                            than in the High Plateau area of Central Viet-Nam, for example.</p>

                        <p>In view of the well-organized and systematic presentation of the
                            attachments, there is little purpose to be served in going into the
                            details of the rebuttals to the <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Halberstam</persName> article. Perhaps it will suffice for your
                            purposes to note Task Force Saigon’s overall comment. that the IV Corps
                            Area, which is that covered by the <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Halberstam</persName> article, is a well-established Viet Cong base
                            area, long neglected by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and
                            therefore the most difficult for the Government to operate in. As the
                            Naval Attache notes, the National Military Campaign plan was developed
                            on the premise that the Mekong Delta area would be the most difficult in
                            which to defeat the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and reestablish
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control. Techniques which have
                            worked well elsewhere, such as the food control program on the High
                            Plateau, have been impossible to execute in the Mekong Delta. With its
                            abundant supplies of food, the Mekong Delta has not been a suitable area
                            for application of food control programs. The low-lying, swampy nature
                            of the terrain has seriously hampered military operations. Accordingly,
                            there has been a lag in the progress of the military and strategic
                            hamlet programs in the Delta, as compared to other Corps areas.</p>
                        <p>However, Task Force Saigon concludes that the situation in the Delta as a
                            whole has not only not deteriorated in the past year but that continual
                            progress has been made in isolating the Viet Cong from the population.
                            There is no doubt that continuing intensified effort, tailored to its
                            special problems will be required for the Delta area in the future.</p>

                                    question as whether he had much choice, generals’ proposals may
                                    have had certain attractions for him. Rightly or wrongly
                                    President appears to have believed that his government had
                                    genuinely attempted path of conciliation with Buddhists. He
                                    could claim that this policy had been unsuccessful in placating
                                    Buddhists and had in fact merely led to expanded Buddhist
                                    activity. In short, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                    probably concluded that this policy had become one-way street to
                                    catastrophe for him, his family and his government. Early action
                                    against Buddhists would also have advantage of presenting
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> with
                                    fait accompli before latter’s arrival. Also by involving
                                    military in repressive actions against Buddhists, he may have
                                    thought that he could taint with same brush as his regime only

                                    in force will be difficult for agitators to organize
                                    demonstrations. However, judging by sentiment in their favor
                                    generated by Buddhist leadership in recent weeks, particularly
                                    among students, possibility of unrest in main cities cannot be

                            was the scene of the first known action under the proclamation. Xa Loi
                            has been cleared and it like other Saigon pagodas has been cordoned off
                            by police and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops.
                            Communications facilities are under heavy guard, military censorship on
                            press cables has been imposed and the Saigon airport has been closed.
                            Security forces are in the streets in number and are guarding the roads
                            into Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Hue is reported to be very tense, but reasonably quiet.
                            Hue’s main pagodas are reported to have been largely destroyed inside
                            earlier in the day by Saigon combat police and there were ugly incidents
                            between highly excited crowds and security forces. Our Consul in Hue
                            reports that anti-US feeling there is at an all-time high in his
                            experience.</p>

                        <p>A problem in US-Vietnamese relations has been created by the escape of

                            obtained refuge. After the police were refused permission by US
                            officials to enter the building, a cordon was thrown around the building
                            and the police denied Americans permission to enter or leave it and
                            demanded that all Vietnamese nationals leave the premises.</p>
                        <p>In the wake of police threats to enter the <gloss target="#t_USOM1"
                                >USOM</gloss> building, our Chargé was called in by Foreign Minister

                            be handed over. The Chargé demurred stating he would have to seek
                            instructions first, meanwhile he noted his concern over possible

                            <item>The declaration of martial law and repression of Buddhist
                                agitation in Viet-Nam are likely to further alienate the public from
                                the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> Government and will
                                have serious repercussions throughout the country. Although the
                                military moves are based on an alleged presidential proclamation,
                                the military leaders have, in effect, assumed full control.</item>

                            <item>Shortly after the declaration of martial law at midnight last
                                night, Army and combat police elements assaulted Buddhist pagodas in
                                Saigon and other principal cities. A number of Buddhist priests were
                                r reportedly killed or injured, and many others were arrested. The
                                purpose apparently was to seize Buddhist leaders capable of
                                organizing and sustaining continued Buddhist agitation. A senior
                                Vietnamese military officer claimed on 19 August that top-ranking
                                officers felt that some action was required to prevent the spread of
                                popular unrest.</item>

                                during the night to secure all key installations in Saigon and the
                                approaches to the city; the Saigon District has been placed under
                                the command of the III Corps Commander. Stringent security measures
                                have been imposed in other cities also. Some disturbances were
                                reported in Hue, where Buddhist pagodas were damaged. <gloss

                            <item>Although senior military commanders are apparently enforcing the
                                presidential martial law decree, further coup or countercoup
                                activity may be in the making. The Armed Forces Chief of Staff
                                implied that martial law may be only temporary. The Army has
                                announced the appointment of general officers to positions of civil,
                                military, and <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0627"/>economic
                                responsibilities. The Army-controlled radio has also appealed to the
                                populace to back the Army, without referring to the government. A
                                major uncertainty in the situation continues to be the attitude of
                                junior officers and enlisted personnel, most of whom are
                                Buddhists.</item>

                                out a coup d’etat. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                                claimed that the military leaders would act only if the country were
                                on the verge of chaos. He claimed that the generals were in control
                                of their subordinates down to the battalion level and would act to
                                prevent a take over by any civilian plotters. The III Corps

                                effect that a coup is inevitable if the present trend continues. It

                                reported that Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had

                            power may be. As we are sure you will agree, three possibilities appear
                            still open: (a) that military are in fact in control and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> continues as President by

                            military cooperation has strengthened his own position; <pb n="605"

                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is actually calling the shots.
                            Possibility also exists that even though military not in saddle now,
                            they may use martial law period to their advantage. If so, might be wise
                            not to press to have martial law removed too quickly.</p>
                        <p>As the facts emerge, we would appreciate your appraisal of the relative
                            power situation of specific groups and individuals, both military and
                            civilian.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of who is running the show, we should continue to seek the
                            same objectives. These are acceptable solution to the Buddhist problem
                            and a more responsive and representative government capable of carrying
                            on the war effectively. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must show
                            own population and world that improvement in Buddhist position will be
                            eventual outcome of evolving situation. If we impress this need on both
                            civilians and military at all levels <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                            >GVN</gloss>, we may be able to achieve some progress not only on
                            immediate Buddhist problem (with all implications this has for U.S. and
                            world opinion) but also on longer range objective of broadening regime
                            and limiting Diem’s exercise of arbitrary power. As situation develops,
                            we may deem it useful to throw our influence toward reducing or
                            eliminating the power of the Nhus. However, we will welcome your fresh
                            reading of this and other aspects of the situation.</p>

                        <p>Military are ostensibly working together and we know of no disagreements
                            among them. However, we do not believe that military should be regarded
                            as monolithic structure at this point. Specifically, we believe that
                            there are at least three power elements in Army, represented by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, General <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName> are not taking orders from
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and we believe that each
                            of three is getting direction from Palace. Further, both <persName

                                >Tung</persName> (who are known to detest each other) have military
                            forces in Saigon. Should regular Army decide to take over in earnest,
                            i.e., depose <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, possibility
                            of serious fighting in Saigon would be considerable, as <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName> could be expected to defend
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. He is thoroughly
                            disliked and distrusted by Army and has always derived all his authority

                                    Otherwise the elections could not be considered free elections

                                    said I was at his beck and call. He stated the war would
                                    continue, the state of martial law should not affect operations
                                    as he was only using the reserve forces to make a show of
                                    military force in the cities. We’ll have to wait and see on
                                    this—so far only one paratroop and one marine battalion, plus
                                    some MP’s have been used in Saigon. In Hue, they moved two tens
                                    from the training center to keep order in the city. However,
                                    other battalions in the vicinity are on the alert. Armored
                                    vehicles have been seen in both cities.</item>

                                <item>The IV Corps is where the war is being fought. 70 per cent of
                                    the weekly incidents are there. Today I’m asking <persName
                                        corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> to move the 9th Div
                                    intact from II Corps to the Delta area to clean up Long An, Dinh
                                    Thuong, Kien Hoa and Vinh Binh provinces. The rest of the Delta
                                    will be slow but easy if we can get these provinces settled.
                                    They’re coming along—but it’s difficult terrain, particularly in
                                    the rainy season. They have more <gloss target="#t_VC1"
                                        >VC</gloss> than most of the provinces, and the people are
                                    harder to convince. They just don’t like the government—just
                                    want to be left alone with their rice and fish.</item>

                                <item>So as far as our programs are concerned, at least the
                                    military, they are paying off, and all that is needed to end the
                                    conflict is the will and determination of the Vietnamese to win.
                                    This I believe is evidenced by the fact that they have averaged
                                    about two or three thousand operations a week since July, and
                                    last week they had over 4,000. This counts everything from
                                    patrols and ambushes to the larger type. However, in my opinion,
                                    I think we will see a drop in the number of operations against
                                    the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> until things settle down a

                                <item>I’m afraid I have rambled in answering your questions;
                                    however, as it looks from here at this time the fact that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> placed the

                                    Though <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> is nominally
                                    in command, it appears that the usual multiple channels still
                                    exist and run to the Palace. I’m not able to answer what’s going
                                    on between them. I’ll keep my ear to the ground and try to
                                    determine. It could be they (the military) through threats or
                                    persuasion told him he’d better do something or else. I can not
                                    prove this with what information I have at this time, nor can I
                                    state flatly he’s not a hostage of the military as I have not
                                    seen him since the announcement of martial law.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Begin Text:</hi> 1. I received a call from Secretary

                            August. He said he had been trying to reach me for two days, that he

                            on the morning of 24th. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>
                            is a personal friend whom I first got to know in 1955 and with whom I
                            have maintained a relatively close relationship since. I do not entirely
                            trust his personal motives at present because his honesty has been too
                            thoroughly compromised (in contrast to <persName corresp="#p_VVH1">Vo
                                Van Hai</persName>, the President’s secretary) by his past

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that he had
                            decided not to resign but to stick with the President a while yet for
                            three reasons: his personal feelings of loyalty to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the Nhus and for the safety
                            of his family (his family is now all in Saigon). <persName
                                corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that the President had
                            sent Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, on 23 August, on
                            his own volition (<persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> took no
                            direct credit for it) a letter in which he ordered her to make no public
                            statements and give no press conferences. The President also instructed
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TTOBG1">Oai</persName> and the Director
                            General of Information not to print any statement she might make. Both
                            Counselor and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were
                            “furious,” according to <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1"
                            >Thuan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> conceded that it would
                            be difficult to split the Nhus off from the President but he felt
                            strongly that the U.S. should attempt this. He said he could see no
                            alternative to the President as a leader for Viet-Nam, no one else was
                            as widely respected, or would be generally acceptable within Viet-Nam.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> felt that the U.S.
                            had to exercise leadership and must be very firm, otherwise chaos was
                            likely to result. Under no circumstances, he said, should the U.S.
                            acquiesce in what the Nhus had done. This would be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> went on to say that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was in a dangerously
                            triumphant mood. <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> believed
                            himself in full control of the situation and was contemptuous of the
                            Americans. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had been very successful
                            in tricking the Army (in answer to a direct question he said the
                            Generals did not know beforehand of the planned raid on Xa Loi, nor did
                            he), and in dividing it into three commands. However, he felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had very little real
                            support in the Army and that the Army would turn firmly against
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> if it knew that the U.S.
                            would under no circumstances support a government with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s in control.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName> also said that the U.S.
                            must not be afraid of leaving the door open to the Communists by
                            withdrawing support from the government as long as it contained the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s. He reiterated that the
                            U.S. had to be firm. If it was, the Army would respond. End Text.</p>

                            saying, bitterly, that Army is now acting as puppet of Counselor

                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> unit leaders on morning of 23rd and
                            he hoped violence between Army and students could be avoided. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had ordered Cao Xuan Vy
                            (Director General of Youth) to organize a massive demonstration of
                            Republican Youth involving over 500,000 people for 25th of August.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> believes that such a
                            demonstration, if it could be organized, would produce a riot of
                            unimaginable proportions and, therefore, must be avoided. He said he
                            doubted that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would listen to
                            any contrary advice about demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> if the Army was
                            united. He said that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            deliberately split the command between Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName>, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and was dealing with each
                            separately. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> (who is <pb
                                n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0640"/>his brother-in-law) does not
                            command much natural support among officer corps but most of other
                            Generals and senior officers, he felt, could be rallied around him
                                (<persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>). Key question was where
                            did US stand. If US took clear stand against <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>s and in support of Army action to remove them from
                            government, the Army (with exception of Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName>) would unite in support of such
                            an action and would be able to carry it out. He felt that retaining
                            President, even though he personally did not like him, would be
                            preferable providing all <persName>Ngo</persName> family influence could
                            be permanently and effectively eradicated. It was not just a question of
                            getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>s, he said, but
                            of also removing their followers from scene.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_KIM1">Kim</persName> said that he and
                            seven other general officers had been obliged on 22 August to sign an
                            oath of loyalty to President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> which fully supported actions taken by government
                            against Buddhists. He said US must not be fooled by this document, that
                            vast majority of Army and most of Generals who signed document, did not
                            approve of repression of Buddhists but had to sign at this time or
                            expose themselves to individual elimination by Counselor <persName

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was asked who was in
                            control and replied President <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> is in control through Counselor <persName

                            saying <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> uses <persName

                                >Nhu’s</persName> advice. President is jealous of his authority and

                                xml:id="pg_615" facs="0641"/>gave an example. At midnight on 22 Aug,
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>, Ton That <persName
                                corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1"
                                >Tran Thien Khiem</persName> went to see <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> about the students, recommending that schools all be
                            closed in Saigon by the martial law, because they had information that
                            on 23, 24, and 25 Aug there would be student demonstrations in Saigon.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> concurred with Generals’
                            recommendation, told them he had to check with the President. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and Generals went to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> recommending closing of schools.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said “no. The young
                            people must have means of expressing themselves.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> repeated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is the man who makes final
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> went on to explain
                            relationships in the Palace. Said it must be remembered that for years
                            President has been agitator against colonialist regimes. During this
                            time <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> did a lot of thinking
                            himself. When he took over govt in 1954 he found it was different and he
                            would have to have people around him who think. He turned to his brother
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> who is a thinker, an
                            individual who has theories, a philosophy. As time went on, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has allowed <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to do most of the thinking. This
                            does not mean President will take all of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu’s</persName> advice. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> likes <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to
                            write presidential proclamations, speeches. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> prefers himself to meet the people and talk to
                            people. In this way <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> has
                            special power as a thinker for the President.</p>
                        <p>4. In describing relationship of Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> in the Palace, <persName corresp="#p_DON1"
                                >Don</persName> said that in <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> ‘s mind Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> has status of being <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> ‘s “wife”. President has never married and not used
                            to having women around him. For past nine years <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has Madame <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> to comfort him after day’s work is
                            Done. She is charming, talks to him, relieves his tension, argues with
                            him, needles him and, like a Vietnamese wife, she is dominant in the
                            household. President and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> live two apartments apart. There are no sexual
                            relations between <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. In <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>’s opinion, President has never had
                            sexual relations.</p>
                        <p>He likened the situation to that of Hitler and Eva Braun. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also said, the President likes good
                            looking men around him. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> cited
                            the case of handsome young sergeant who planted a public garden in
                            Dalat. President asked who had planted the garden and when informed,
                            called the sergeant to the Palace and immediately promoted him to Lt.
                            Colonel and put him in charge of military agriculture. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> has intense passions. When he
                            likes somebody, he likes them all the way; when he hates someone, he
                            hates completely. There is no in-between. Madame <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> uses her privileged position with
                            President to make him say yes when he wants to say no, but he is won by
                            her charm. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said, “as I know,
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> can be extremely
                            charming.” <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said it would be
                            practically impossible to get rid of the <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>s because of special positions they hold; <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> being President’s thinker
                            and Madame <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> his platonic
                            wife.</p>

                            from outside Saigon and returning them to their own provinces and
                            pagodas. Plan was presented by Generals to <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> headed the group that
                            presented the plan to the President.</p>
                        <p>6. Generals told President that morale of troops was deteriorating, and
                            in fact they feared that one military post was near state of desertion.
                            Generals said that wives of soldiers and junior officers were getting
                            upset. They explained to President the situation as the military saw it
                            vis-a-vis the Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            claims he told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> that 8 May
                            affair in Hue could have been settled but that the <gloss

                            Pagoda. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> described tactics
                            used in demonstrations on 11 Aug when bonze Thich Tam Chau was
                            haranguing the crowd at Xa Loi. Chau held crowd spellbound with
                            questions like “are we going to march in streets”? Crowd would call back
                            “yes”. Suddenly Chau would say “no, we will not march in the streets.
                            The fact that you have said we are going to march in streets is same as
                            marching in the streets.” <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            felt that the bonze who spoke English, Thich Duc Nghiep, was very
                            dangerous and the Generals feared that if the Buddhist leaders assembled
                            a large enough crowd they could order a march toward Gia Long Palace and
                            the army would not stop them.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said the President made
                            decision to establish martial law after the Generals had recommended it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> made the decision to
                            bring in troops to occupy strategic points of Saigon/Cholon and approved
                            the recommendation to move bonzes visiting Saigon back to their
                            provinces and their pagodas. President insisted however that none of the
                            bonzes be hurt. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said this
                            touched him very much that the President should insist on their not
                            harming the Buddhists. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            appointed General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> as

                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also said that the

                                >Don</persName>) except some of the younger Generals. These younger
                            Generals are jealous of <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>’s
                            having assumed General Ty’s command. <persName corresp="#p_DON1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> was criticized by these
                            younger Generals for the action that was taken against the Buddhists.
                            Majority of Vietnamese Generals are Buddhist. For example, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said, “when I want to tell General

                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said also that <persName

                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> queried why <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> did not admit that Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName>’s Special Forces and the Police
                            carried out the action. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            believes this would help the military at this point. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> stated that the USA should now make
                            its position known. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> does not
                            want <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> replaced, for example,
                            by an exile like Hoan (possibly Nguyen Ton Hoan) who is presently in the
                            US. He admitted that within the military there is no one who could
                            replace <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> . He cited, as an
                            example, himself, saying, “I’m not smart nor am I ambitious. I only took
                            the job to keep the Generals together”.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> implied he is aware of
                            planned future developments. He said “This is the first step, and the
                            secret of what is going to happen is not mine to give”. When asked how
                            long he thought martial law would last, <persName corresp="#p_DON1"
                                >Don</persName> said it depended on what is going to happen. When
                            asked if the National Assembly elections on 31 Aug would be held he said
                            the elections will probably be delayed, but there will be a relaxation
                            of martial law on 24 Aug as far as curfew is concerned.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> did not say anything about
                            keeping <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in power or
                            replacing him with someone inside <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            beyond his statement that he did not want one of the Vietnamese exile
                            politicians to achieve power and that no military figure could do the
                            job. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> officer received the
                            impression, and it was an impression only, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> and his group wished to retain
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> in power for the
                            present phase of their plan.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also said that he realizes
                            he will probably be “sacrificed” as a result of the martial law action
                            but this is not too important because there are other military leaders
                            who will take his place. He did not name them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> gave the impression that he is not
                            the man behind the whole thing. He is the figurehead. He is responsible
                            for the first phase. There are others in the group who will take over
                            other phases. Nothing <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said
                            implied who the man or men might be who <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619"
                                facs="0645"/>would take over other phases. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> mentioned the fact that <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> is playing up the resignation of
                            Ambassador <persName>Chuong</persName>. He repeated that <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts are hurting the military. He
                            said it does no good to say that military action has been taken against
                            the Buddhists and that the U.S. Govt deplores this action and at the
                            same time say that the USA continues aid. He did not expand on this to
                            indicate what action the USA should take.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> made no mention of Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> or of any other
                            Cabinet members.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said that after this first
                            phase, things cannot revert back to what was before. When asked if he
                            referred to the government, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            said, “yes, I’m talking about the government. The President has got to
                            change some of his Ministers. “ <persName corresp="#p_DON1"
                                >Don</persName> did not name any specific ministers. He said events
                            are controlling the situation. <persName corresp="#p_DON1"
                                >Don</persName> said if he had to choose between President <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, he would choose the President. He gave no
                            indication of what other officers might be thinking about <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. When asked if something happens,
                            and the President is no longer in power, would <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> go with <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> said “if
                            I have the choice between the President and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> is
                            going.” He doesn’t want <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>16. Reporting officer received the impression from <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> that although the President is
                            still in the saddle what is going on now is being controlled by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. The impression is strong
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> is not
                            completely aware of everything that is going on around him. From
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>’s statements it appears
                            that there is a junior element among the Generals causing him trouble.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> indicated that he wants
                            assurances one way or the other from the U.S. Govt. He appears not to
                            know what to do next. He is completely controlled by events and reacts
                            rather than plans next moves. It seems <persName corresp="#p_DON1"
                                >Don</persName> himself feels he does not have the power of
                            [or?]enough influence over the Generals to overthrow the President.
                            However <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> did not give the
                            impression that he wants by choice to overthrow the President. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> evidently wants to conciliate the
                            Buddhists and said that the military should restore the pagodas and the
                            holy statues that were destroyed in some of the pagodas. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> made no statements on the second
                            phase of the plan. <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> did not
                            indicate how long the first phase would last but did indicate it would
                            last beyond the scheduled National Assembly elections.</p>
                        <p>17. Our impression is that there is considerable significance in
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>’s statement that this is
                            only the first phase and the secret of future phases is not his to tell.
                            We cannot determine whether <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>
                            means that future phases containing the “secret” will be controlled from
                            within the military or, for example, by <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>, or by other civilian figures. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName><pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620"
                                facs="0646"/>made no comment on any civilians by name. He said the
                            Army’s primary aim is to fight the Viet Cong. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName> also said that there was no 10

                            Specifically, as indicated (d) above, we have no information that
                            officers with troops in Saigon are disposed to act in this way.
                            Moreover, there is no showing that military have agreed among themselves
                            on a leadership.</p>
                        <p>Action on our part in these circumstances would seem to be a shot in the
                            dark. Situation at this time does not call for that, in my judgment, and
                            I believe we should bide our time, continuing to watch situation
                            closely.</p>

                        <p>We are faced with a crisis of credibility such as seldom has happened
                            before in a situation as critical as this. You will hear indignant
                            contrary views, but my observation is that not only the newsmen here but
                            also a good many Americans in relatively senior official positions
                            believe very nearly nothing that any official U.S. Agency says about the
                            situation in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Just a week ago, for example, I visited a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> outpost in the Delta. The senior officer told me that
                            things were going exceptionally well. After he left, his deputy told me
                            that the situation was rapidly deteriorating. The deputy, frankly, was
                            more persuasive. This is typical. You are confronted here with a
                            community of some 18,000 or 19,000 Americans who are torn by doubt,
                            distrust of their own leadership, deep frustration in the face of
                            personal danger, contempt for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            yet often a real affection for the low-level Vietnamese with whom they
                            work, disgust mixed with a wonderful determination to win, and equally
                            wonderful morale in spite of everything.</p>
                        <p>Which suggests an example: I said 18,000 to 19,000 Americans. There are
                            just over 16,000 military personnel in Vietnam, plus 2,000 to 3,000
                            civilians. The military figure is scheduled to peak at 16,700 this fall.
                            It is official policy (supporting documents on request) that there are
                            “about” 14,000 military personnel here. Colonel Baker and I have been
                            trying for more than a month to persuade the authorities to allow us to
                            leak the true figure to the press-along with pleas not to make a story
                            of it-but in vain. We are invited, in effect, to lie to the American
                            people on this question. It is very nearly a certainty that the correct
                            figure will be found out, resulting in another body blow to the
                            credibility of the U.S. Mission here.</p>

                            must assume everything in the <gloss target="#t_OPSUM1">OPSUM</gloss>
                            comes from Vietnamese sources. Result: the <gloss target="#t_OPSUM1"

                            many people in Washington. (I was present at a meeting of the Vietnam
                            Working Group in May when this was said in so many words. Nobody
                            objected.)</p>
                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0649"/>
                        <p>Recently an old-hand correspondent in Southeast Asia was here for a
                            visit. After a fortnight, he told me he thought the war was going badly.
                            I said: “If this is true, then the leadership of the American mission
                            here is committing an astonishing mistake in judgment.” He said: “The
                            French thought they were going to win, too.” This, of course, is glib.
                            Drawing a parallel with the French is notably unjustified. But I was
                            here, too, during the period of Dienbienphu, and I think it is true that
                            the psychological atmosphere has a similar flavor. This seems to be
                            characteristic of a Western nation engaged against guerrillas …<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d277fn6">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> to
                            subsist on statistics of casualty ratios and weapons-lost ratios,
                            reluctant to face up to the profound, unmeasurable unknowns of a
                            quicksilver war.</p>
                        <p>These are intangible questions. The issue is not who is right. Nobody can
                            prove an argument on any subject in Vietnam. The issue is the
                            extraordinarily urgent need for the U.S. Government to recognize the
                            reality that Vietnam remains in doubt, and to stop pontificating. In my
                            opinion, the American people Don’t duck a struggle, nor setbacks, much
                            less a candid admission of setbacks. But they do react to false
                            optimism. One of the reasons for the present explosive reaction of the
                            American press to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and to U.S.
                            policy, is the fact that most American newsmen feel they have been
                            misled. To put it bluntly, if it had been freely conceded that this is
                            something less than the best regime ever, there would be a lot less
                            bitterness now that the fact has been conclusively established.</p>
                        <p>On the question of your own posture vis-à-vis the press, my most urgent
                            recommendation is that you attempt from the outset to engage the newsmen
                            in your own problems. You face the immediate, indigestible possibility,
                            for example, that thoughtful analysis of the political situation may
                            lead to the conclusion that the U.S. must still support the <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> regime. If you will invite the
                            newsmen, in effect, to share in the agonizing, and level with them on
                            details of the problem (most of which they will find out anyway), there
                            is at least a chance that you can carry some of them along in your
                            eventual decision, as well as the subsequent pulling and hauling to make
                            it work. My candid belief is that a decision reached in lonely,
                            highly-classified isolation from the press is unlikely to be supported,
                            however sensible.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> was an
                            open-season target on the grounds that he was too “soft” with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> . I was here as a correspondent
                            in 1955 when Ambassador <persName>Collins</persName> was attacked by the
                            press (including me) with equal ferocity because he was too “tough” with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> . In both cases, the
                            prosecuting correspondents argued that the Ambassador did not understand
                            Asians. In both cases, the Ambassador was also reluctant to share his
                            problems with the press. And in both cases, <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624"
                                facs="0650"/>it worked out that the Ambassador’s problems were
                            shared anyway with the press, via leaks in Washington on anything he did
                            of much significance. As noted in my memo to <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1"
                                >Manning</persName>, experience has proved that secrets simply
                                <persName corresp="#p_DON1">Don</persName>’t keep in a situation as
                            explosive and vital as this.</p>
                        <p>Some specific suggestions:</p>
                        <p>Limit your public comment to an absolute minimum, and always avoid any
                            kind of public judgment on how things are going. Most of all, Don’t be
                            optimistic in public; American officials who talk about optimism in
                            Vietnam remind most newsmen of Chinese Communists talking about “peace”.
                            Don’t be too easily accessible to correspondents, but when you do see
                            one, give him a lot of time and level to the most intimate degree
                            possible. Never be defensive about U.S. policy here and emphatically not
                            about the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; try to maintain a
                            detached, gee-what-should-we-do atmosphere. Try to include a responsible
                            correspondent in as many social functions as possible, including
                            high-level dinners (you will do your business anyway in a talk in a
                            corner after dinner when none of the guests can eavesdrop), but never
                            invite all the press as a group, which makes it look like charity.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, treat the newsman as an ally, never as an antagonist.
                            Assuming the present line-up stays in office, you will find that you can
                            negotiate, albeit with notable difficulty, on material issues, e.g.
                            military strategy and economic planning, but that efforts to persuade
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to change its ways on domestic
                            political questions almost always come a cropper. If nothing else, this
                            is surely the lesson of the regime’s solemn commitment to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> to pursue a policy of
                            conciliation with the Buddhists. Generally speaking, negotiations with
                            hope of success should not be made public, but negotiations with no hope
                            of success should be pursued, in part, through the pressures of
                            stateside publicity.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the latter means mainly the social and political reforms
                            that are so badly needed here. If you level, I think most newsmen will
                            go along with you in both cases. If you Don’t level, you not only fail
                            to achieve the reforms, but it also looks as though you’re not
                            trying.</p>
                        <p>Finally, a word on the mood of the moment among the 30 or 40 foreign
                            newsmen in Saigon. Many of the visitors are here for the first time, or
                            anyway for the first time in months or years, insensitive to the
                            maddening complexities of the story, and determined to report whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> looks good or bad. I
                            think you can duck trouble with them simply by begging time to sort
                            things out. Among the regulars, however, there is a mood that verges on
                            hysteria. They are exhausted after three months of an extraordinarily
                            difficult story, emotionally engaged in the most violent four-letter
                            terms, full of extravagant hopes <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0651"
                            />that Lodge can square things away, and scared. Three of them have been
                            sleeping at my house for the past three nights for fear of raids on
                            their homes.</p>
                        <p>This is a time to be cautious, to avoid any kind of opinion on
                            controversial issues, e.g. who’s winning the war, but also a time to
                            invite and share confidences and hopefully establish a new base of
                            understanding between the newsmen and the official American community
                            that is urgently needed.</p>

                        <p>Concurrently with above, Ambassador and country team should urgently
                            examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as
                            to how we might bring about <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>

                        <p>You will understand that we cannot from Washington give you detailed
                            instructions as to how this operation should proceed, but you will also
                            know we will back you to the hilt on actions you take to achieve our
                            objectives.</p>

                            <item>At about 1800 I received a telephone call on the Command Center
                                System from Admiral Riley, who recounted conversations with Mr.

                                    <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> concerning messages
                                which had come in on the situation in Saigon. He referred to a
                                proposed course of action deriving from recommendations made by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_THUAN1">Thuan</persName>, said that the
                                course of action was viewed favorably by <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                    >Hilsman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1"

                            <item>I told Admiral Riley that I had been called by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>, doubtless on the same
                                subject. With Admiral Riley also on the phone, a call was put
                                through to <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>. He
                                asked if I had seen the messages, to which Admiral Riley had earlier
                                alluded. I replied that I had not. He then said that they made clear
                                a course of action, which he, <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                    >Hilsman</persName> and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1"
                                    >Harriman</persName> had converted into an instruction to

                                for approval; that it was not something on which Defense clearance
                                was desired, but that he was seeking to advise Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> of the message. He asked

                                    >Taylor</persName>, to which I assented. He asked me to come to
                                the White House situation room and get the message.</item>

                            <item>Admiral Riley interjected the information that he had been in
                                communication with <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, and agreed that
                                the general course of action appeared sound, although he had not
                                seen the draft message referred to.</item>

                            <item>I went to the White House situation room at about 1900 and read

                                    >Forrestal</persName> then showed me the enclosure,<note n="3"

                                President for approval. He stated that he had just finished
                                discussing it with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                    >Gilpatric</persName> by telephone, and that Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> was in accord with its

                                my views on the content of the enclosure; however, I made two
                                observations. First, where the words “press on all levels of the
                                GVN” appear, that my interpretation is that it means we must start
                                with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> himself, and not
                                foreclose him. Second, where it speaks of “key military leaders”
                                that it is delusive to <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0657"
                                />think of the Vietnamese military as united and homogeneous. It is,
                                in fact and by design, fragmented. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1"
                                    >Forrestal</persName> concurred with these comments, without
                                elaboration.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I asked to have a copy of the draft made, which I could take to
                                General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>; called his
                                quarters and requested that I be notified when he returned. I then
                                went to my quarters and, at about 1930, notified Admiral Riley of
                                above. He said he intended to call Admiral <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and bring him up to
                                date.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>Immediately after finishing the call to Riley, I was called by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>, who wanted me
                                to report that the President had in fact approved the message, with
                                only the addition that the means of its implementation would be in
                                the discretion of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                    >Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                    >Harkins</persName>. I reported this to Admiral Riley, who
                                stated that he had already called Admiral <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>, and would not give him the
                                additional information since he would probably get it in an
                                information copy of the message. I told him that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> did not show up as an
                                addressee on the draft that I had.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I called General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                                quarters and made specific arrangements for him to call me at the
                                command center, on his return. At about 2145, not having been
                                called, I called General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                    >Taylor</persName>’s quarters, found him there and took the
                                enclosure to him.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> read the
                                message, questioned me on the nature of the incoming messages which
                                gave rise to it, and upon the earlier events of the day, of which I
                                had knowledge. He then observed that he would not wish to be on the
                                receiving end of the message, that it is not sufficiently explicit,
                                that it does not give <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                adequate chance to do what we want. He stated that it reflects the
                                well-known compulsion of <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                    >Hilsman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FMV1"
                                    >Forrestal</persName> to depose <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                    >Diem</persName> and, had <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                    Bundy</persName> been present, he would not have approved the
                                message. Finally, he stated that the message had not been given the
                                quality of interdepartmental staffing it deserved, and that he would
                                be prepared to say so at a proper time.</item>

                                    have three Cabinet posts. Interior—most important to preserve

                                Khanh</persName> requested immediate meeting with <gloss

                            half hour conversation preceded by frank plea that regardless of our
                            ultimate decision we not declare his stand to Counsellor <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, he proceeded along following
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>2. The Generals still taking orders within the legal framework of the
                            Constitution, even though some of them have a heartache over some of the
                            actions taken by the government in the process of restoring order.</p>
                        <p>3. Some of the Generals (he refused to identify further, stating it was
                            not necessary to put any other head on the block at this point beside
                            his own) are however determined to stop taking orders from the
                            politicians (queried for definition he flatly stated the
                                <persName>Ngo</persName> family) the very minute South Vietnam’s
                            anticommunist stand comes in question. These Generals now fear that the
                            politicians are now thinking in the direction of an arrangement with the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> remarked that the
                            United States has not taken any stand over recent events beside bland
                            statements of disapproval of some of the incidents. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> now wants to know (and soon, he
                            asked for a reply by 1530 this afternoon when he would return to Pleiku
                            and was told a reply by that time would be impossible) whether the
                            United States would support “the Army” should it move to take over the
                            country. Regardless of our decision, he reiterated, the Army would go it
                            alone should it become clear that the politicians were heading for any
                            softening on anticommunism.</p>
                        <p>5. Asked to amplify he declined, but offered “as an example” the
                            following hypothesis: let’s assume that United States decides to curtail
                            or cut aid to Viet Nam in order to force the Ngo family to toe the line,
                            and the politicians decide to seek an agreement with the <gloss
                                target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or even with Communist China for a
                            neutralization of Viet Nam. If this were to happen he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>, and his General friends would
                            definitely revolt. What would the American military, who have fought
                            side by side with the Vietnamese soldiers so far, do?</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> stated he has four
                            divisions under his command and he can do “pas mal des choses”, quite a
                            few things. Declining once again to name Generals allied with him, he
                            acceded only to replying that <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0660"
                            />while General <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName> is
                            a good and respected friend, he, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1"
                                >Khanh</persName> cannot afford to trust him at this moment and that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien Khiem</persName> is
                            completely on <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> side.</p>
                        <p>7. Throughout the conversation there was a strong plea for a very rapid
                            assessment of the situation by the United States, to determine if any
                            errors had been committed in the past and should this be established to
                            be the case, prompt, immediate, intelligent and strong remedial action.
                            Asked if he and his Generals have any plan for follow through on
                            political plane, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> said
                            they were only military trying to keep the country from being turned
                            over to communism: it was up to the United States to take care of the
                            political part. At any rate, he reiterated at the end, the Generals
                            would go down fighting if the politicians now in power moved in the
                            wrong direction, which the Generals now fear is the case.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> has not visited the
                            Palace since 20 Aug. Was asked (did not say by whom) to remain in Saigon

                                    be fallacious since nothing is accomplished with any man by
                                    making him lose face. If our objective is to be achieved at all,
                                    it must be achieved by the Vietnamese themselves and must look
                                    natural. The US must not appear publicly in the matter, thus
                                    giving the “kiss of death” to its friends.</item>

                        <p>3. The President asked if we are adequately prepared for protecting
                            and/or evacuating U.S. citizens in Vietnam. He was shown the’ summary of
                            military preparations to back up the Embassy program and was told that
                            we have a battalion landing team at sea, 24 hours distant from Saigon
                            now.</p>
                        <p>4. The President observed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"

                            is actually running a political campaign; that he is wholly unobjective,
                            reminiscent of Mr. <persName>Matthews</persName> in the Castro days. He
                            stated that it was essential that we not permit <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Halberstam</persName> unduly to influence our

                                    >Hilsman</persName>’s record of the meeting he paraphrased the
                                President as follows: “<persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                    >Halberstam</persName> was a 28-year old kid and he [the
                                President] wanted assurances we were not giving him serious
                                consideration in our decision.”</note> Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> assured the President that this
                            was not the case.</p>
                        <p>5. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> interjected
                            the opinion that in this case we have acted at the first opportunity;
                            that at an earlier moment we could not have accurately located the
                            sources of strength and support.<note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">In

                                have been; that Saturday [August 24] was the first day that we knew
                                the situation and that no such decision could ever have been taken
                                unless the people of Viet-Nam had themselves fumed against the
                                government; i.e., the act of beating up the Pagodas swung people
                                against the regime and that we had made our decision at the earliest
                                possible moment after that act.”</note></p>

                        <p>6. The President observed<note n="5" xml:id="d289fn5"><persName

                                various forces in Saigon was also discussed-the impression being
                                left that Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName>’s
                                forces were the only military now present in Saigon with the
                                exception of some Marine battalions which might in fact be loyal to

                            however repugnant in some respects, have done a great deal along the
                            lines that we desire and, when we move to eliminate this government, it
                            should not be a result of <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> observed that
                            there are many military difficulties involved in the execution of the
                            plan embodied in the 243 cable; that the Vietnamese military is split
                            three ways; that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> is truly
                            the focus and that we should put our first effort on him.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> raised the
                            question of whether <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> knows
                            the extent to which his brother is undermining him, offering as an
                            example the thousands of his personal pictures which have been printed
                            and displayed.</p>
                        <p>9. The President recalled that about six weeks ago Nhu had a meeting with

                            he is trying to take over himself. <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> responded that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> is riding the fence. He continued on the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> subject by stating that Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> had called him,
                            referred to various cables involved in the situation, and expressed
                            concern as to what would happen unless the Nhus were removed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> quoted him as saying that unless
                            the Nhus were eliminated the middle level enlisted men would soon lose
                            their interest in fighting. <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>
                            believed that the Generals could handle the situation but that we will
                            have to make known our willingness to support them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> said that subsequent to this

                        <p>10. The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName>, in light of his experience in the Pentagon, what
                            chance a plan such as outlined in State Cable 243 would have of
                            succeeding. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            replied that in Washington we would not turn over the problem of
                            choosing a head of state to the military.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0666"/>
                        <p>11. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> then raised the
                            question of whether it would be wise to have a public or a classified
                            statement concerning the curtailment of travel. The President approved a
                            classified approach to the problem, following <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName>’s advice that a public statement might in some
                            way tip our hand.</p>
                        <p>12. The President asked what the Voice of America is saying on the
                            subject, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName>
                            replied that they were guilty of an error today when they speculated on
                            our use of aid cuts as a sanction against the Vietnamese. He stated that
                            this was contrary to explicit instructions that Voice of America should
                            not become involved in speculation.</p>
                        <p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked when Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> plans to have a
                            business session with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> had no knowledge of
                            any planned meeting.</p>
                        <p>14. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that a
                            study of the problem raised these questions in his mind:</p>
                        <p>a. Exactly what Generals are we speaking of when we address the, subject
                            of a “general officers group”?</p>
                        <p>To this <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> replied that while
                            we have contacted only three (<persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1"
                                >Khiem</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>) there are others,
                            although these three declined to name their colleagues. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then expressed the view that
                            we should query Saigon as to exactly who the loyal Generals are.</p>
                        <p>b. His second question was: what exactly do we mean in State Cable 243 by
                            the term “direct support”?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> replied that this meant
                            finding ways to support the Vietnamese military logistically, not using
                            Saigon as a port of entry.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked me if I was familiar
                            with the geography of the area, to which I replied in the affirmative.
                            He then asked if I believed it would be practical to provide logistical
                            support to the military forces directly, without the use of Saigon as a
                            logistic base. I stated that it would be extremely difficult, involving
                            major changes in our system and equipment and would require considerable
                            time to develop a completely new arrangement. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that, in any case, this
                            idea had not been examined by the military and that he would estimate it
                            to be a very difficult project.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded the
                            discussion on this question by stating that he believed we should query
                            our representation in Saigon and find out more on their interpretation
                            of what the “direct support” requirement embodies.</p>
                        <p>c. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s third question
                            was what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> is to
                            say to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>. There never really
                            was a response to this question.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he did not believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would let his brother be ejected
                            from the scene. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            demurred from this viewpoint stating that he was not at all sure this
                            was the case, while Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName>
                            said that the Country Team believes that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> will
                            rise or fall together.</p>
                        <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>15. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then raised the
                            question of who Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>
                            believes could replace <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>,
                            stating that if we stand by and let a weak man get in the Presidency we
                            will ultimately suffer. In this regard the President asked if the
                            Foreign Minister who recently resigned<note n="8" xml:id="d289fn8"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_VVM1">Vu Van Mau</persName>.</note> might
                            be a good candidate, to which <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> replied in the negative—stating that it is his
                            view that the Generals would probably support Big Minh.</p>
                        <p>16. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that
                            it might be possible to survive with Vice.President <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> at the head, supported by a strong
                            military junta.</p>
                        <p>17. The President asked what would happen if we find we are faced with
                            having to live with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> replied this would be horrible
                            to contemplate because of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName>
                            grave emotional instability.</p>
                        <p>18. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then stated that, in
                            the broad sense, it appears that unless a major change in <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy can be engineered, we must
                            actually decide whether to move our resources out or to move our troops
                            in.</p>
                        <p>19. The President asked if we are being blamed in Vietnam for the
                            situation, to which <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName>
                            responded that we may be suffering slightly but that mostly the people
                            seem to want to get rid of the Nhus, but clearly need U.S. support to do
                            so. He stated that, on these terms, it is imperative that we act.</p>
                        <p>20. The President stated that there should be another meeting tomorrow to
                            discuss the matter further. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> stated that, as a matter of first priority, we
                            should procure biographical sketches of the key personalities involved,
                            following which General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            suggested that we should talk to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName>. The President agreed and stated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> should be brought to the
                            meeting tomorrow, following which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1"
                                >Hilsman</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName>’s view are colored, in that he is emotionally
                            involved in the situation. Upon hearing this, the President observed,
                            “Maybe properly.”</p>
                        <p>21. The President then stated that the matters discussed in the room
                            should be held very closely and that the need-to-know group should be
                            kept in the minimum number.</p>

                            something about the United States and also something about the United
                            Nations and hoped I might advise him on American affairs and that he
                            would listen to my advice whether or not he took it.</p>
                        <p>I said that the United States Government, as the term is used in foreign
                            affairs, does not include Congress and that in the broad sense it is
                            impossible to hook the United States of America because public opinion
                            is essential to any long range policy and without the support of public
                            opinion you can not get the support of Congress and without the support
                            of Congress you can not get funds. It was interesting to me that people
                            whom I had known all my life in politics thought that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> was the Chief of State of
                            Viet-Nam and that I had met several people in Massachusetts who had seen
                            her picture on the covers of magazines and had read some of her
                            statements about barbecuing the priests and total destruction of the
                            Buddhists and that this had shocked public opinion. The idea that the
                            government was persecuting the Buddhists was also shocking to American
                            opinion which favors religious toleration. All these things were
                            threatening American support of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> said that he had done his
                            best to get <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> to keep
                            quiet and that he had spoken to her several times. He said jokingly that
                            he had even threatened to take a wife but that she said that she was a
                            member of the Assembly and had a right to make speeches.</p>
                        <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0671"/>
                        <p>I told him that a dramatic gesture such as liberating the Buddhist
                            prisoners would have a good effect on American opinion. He said he had
                            liberated most of them and to prove in [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>]point
                            that Buddhists were small percentage of population gave me book which I

                                >Not found.</note> published by the Xa Loi Pagoda in Saigon which
                            states “under the General Buddhist Association’s authority and general
                            direction, are grouped, on the one hand, 3 sanghas numbering well over
                            3,000 monks and about 600 nuns, on the other hand, three communities of
                            disciples which branch out their ramification as far as to remote
                            hamlets. The figures of adherents to these three legally constituted lay
                            associations and their affiliates reach about 1,000,000, to which it
                            should be added an important number of non-associate disciples by as
                            much as threefold.”</p>
                        <p>The next two hours were spent by him in a remarkable discourse about his
                            own family and extent to which Viet-Nam was an underdeveloped country.
                            The serious lack of educated people, the difficulty which he had in
                            finding people who could write a simple statement for him, how he had to
                            write most of his own proclamations himself, how inferior persons held
                            posts in universities who abused their trust by turning educational
                            institutions into centers of unrest.</p>
                        <p>He then talked about the way in which a small Buddhist sect had been
                            taken over by agitators and how plastic explosives had been distributed
                            one of which could knock down a whole house. He said that delinquents
                            were used to agitate the people in the market place and that often the
                            police had no choice but to fire in self defense. He said that there was
                            a well organized plan to create unrest around the country which would
                            pull the troops out of the city, leaving the capital defenseless. It was
                            under these circumstances that he had decreed martial law. In response
                            to questions from me he said he did not know how long marital law would
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>At the very end of the meeting, he said he hoped there would be
                            discipline, particularly as regards the United States’ activities in
                            Saigon and that there would be an end to reports of diverse activities
                            interfering in Vietnamese affairs by various United States agencies.</p>
                        <p>I said that I had just arrived and naturally could not know everything
                            that was going on but would look into it.</p>

                                statements from Washington should stop. He used the French phrase
                                “doivent s'arreter”, which could be translated “must stop”. U.S.
                                statements about Vietnam were accepted at face value by many other
                                governments and U.S. was therefore injuring Vietnam’s standing with
                                foreign countries. He said that Washington should await <pb n="652"

                                had specifically demanded the action which had been taken. He
                                thought that the U.S. people talked too much, whereas in Vietnam
                                they did not talk enough.</item>

                                there were some things that were very real to me as a man who had
                                spent many years in public life and one of them was that no long
                                range foreign policy could be carried out by the U.S. Government
                                without the support of Congress and public opinion. I said that
                                public opinion in the U.S. was much distressed by the treatment of
                                the Buddhists and statements made in connection therewith. These
                                have greatly complicated the job of the Executive branch of the U.S.
                                Government in aiding Vietnam and that frankly I sympathized with
                                whatever efforts the Executive branch might make to make clear to
                                U.S. public opinion that our Vietnam policy did not involve
                                stultifying ourselves-which would definitely be the case if we

                            Conein met with General <persName corresp="#p_TTKG1">Tran Thien
                                Khiem</persName> at the latter’s invitation at <gloss
                                target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> Hqs 1450 local 27 August. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> stated that the
                            question of a military coup against the government had been discussed by
                            a committee of Generals headed by General <persName corresp="#p_DVMG1"
                                >Duong Van Minh</persName>, and that they are agreed a coup will
                            take place within one week.</p>
                        <p>2. The committee of Generals in addition to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DVMG1">Duong Van Minh</persName> includes the following
                            additional personalities: General <persName corresp="#p_LVKBG1">Le Van
                                Kim</persName>; General <persName corresp="#p_NKMG1">Nguyen
                                Khanh</persName>; General Pham Xuan Chieu; General Nguyen Ngoc Le;
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TTOBG1">Tran Tu Oai</persName> is not a
                            member of the committee but has indicated he will cooperate. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TVDMG1">Tran Van Don</persName> is a <pb
                                n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0680"/>member of the committee but
                            cannot act because he is surrounded by personalities from the Presidency
                            who block effective action on his part.</p>
                        <p>3. The Generals who are not included in the planning and who must be
                            neutralized include: General <persName corresp="#p_TTDMG1">Ton That
                                Dinh</persName>; General <persName corresp="#p_HVCBG1">Huynh Van

                        <p>4. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Le Quang Tung</persName> is
                            considered a primary target by the coup committee and will be destroyed
                            together with his entire encampment as one of the first acts of the
                            coup.</p>
                        <p>5. In connection with the destruction of Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_TLQTT1">Tung</persName> and his Special Forces, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> requested and was
                            told he would receive a complete inventory of the ordnance now in stock
                            at the Long Thanh training camp.</p>
                        <p>6. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Nguyen Ngoc Tho</persName>
                            is aware of the coup planning and supports it. He is the choice of the
                            Generals as civilian leader of the succeeding government. He is aware of
                            the seven points presented by Conein to <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1"
                                >Khiem</persName> 26 August.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">See <ref

                        <p>7. The government to be formed after the coup will be headed by Vice
                            President <persName corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName> but will include
                            some military officers in Cabinet positions. The government will not be
                            a military government or junta since the coup committee believes that
                            circumstance would lead to instability as is the case in Korea at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>8. General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> stated that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVMG1">Duong Van Minh</persName> had
                            specifically requested it be passed to Colonel Conein that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> feels his position is
                            so precarious at the present moment that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> cannot make contact with any
                            Americans at the present time. Americans should not try to contact
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. Likewise, General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>
                            stated that he did not wish Colonel Conein to visit <gloss
                                target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> again on these matters until the coup
                            has been completed. Alternatively, General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1"
                                >Khiem</persName> suggested that [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">Numbered paragraph 10 (5 lines) not

                        <p>11. General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> also requested
                            that all official American media cease all discussion of extension or
                            cut-off of aid to Vietnam. General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1"
                                >Khiem</persName> states that the recent statements on this matter
                            by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> have been confusing and could
                            hurt the Generals’ cause by leading people to believe that the U.S. will
                            continue aid to the present government regardless of circumstances.</p>
                        <p>12. General <persName corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> came to Saigon
                            on night of 26 August and contacted General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName>. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHANH1">Khanh</persName> is in complete agreement with
                            the coup plan.</p>

                        <p>13. General <persName corresp="#p_KHIEM1">Khiem</persName> asked for and
                            received assurance that the U.S. would do all in its power to assist the
                            families of the Generals engaged in the coup plot in the event of its
                            failure.</p>

                        <p>You will meet this afternoon at 4 p.m. with the principal officials
                            concerned with our policies in South Vietnam, including Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> and Ambassador <persName

                            prepared to report to you on the most recent developments. A committee
                            of generals has been formed for the purpose of bringing about a military
                            coup within a week. It is contemplated that the government would be
                            formed after the coup, to be headed by Vice-President <persName
                                corresp="#p_THO1">Tho</persName>, and will include some military
                            officers in cabinet positions. The generals have asked for a token of
                            U.S. good faith in the form of an innocuous message over the Voice of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>We also have a report of parallel coup plans by certain civilian leaders.
                            This group includes the labor leader, Tran Quoc Buu, and puts up General
                            (Big) <persName corresp="#p_MINH1">Minh</persName> as President.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the meeting is largely to inform you of latest
                            developments and progress in planning. Ambassador <persName

                                >Rusk</persName> opened the meeting by suggesting that for the
                            immediate future it might be necessary to have daily meetings with the
                            President and carry on an exercise comparable to that done by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Executive Committee for Cuba. He asked
                            for a report on the situation in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">William Colby</persName>, the Vietnam
                            expert from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, said that the situation
                            in Saigon was quiet. He summarized a situation report which concluded
                            that unrest was not apparent in the Vietnam countryside. He referred to
                            the efforts of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MAU1"
                                >Mau</persName> to resign and leave the country. On the operations
                            side, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> reported that
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officials had interviewed two
                            Vietnamese generals yesterday. One general said the situation for a coup
                            was favorable and forecast that one would take place within a week. The
                            second general gave what was described as a jumpy answer in response to
                            the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> initiative. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CW1">Colby</persName> concluded by summarizing
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName>’s report of his
                            talk with <hi rend="italic">Nhu</hi> (see attached [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> hasn’t come to grips
                            with the problem in Vietnam in his talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>. He may be waiting to see what the Vietnamese
                            generals are going to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> asked what elections the Vietnamese
                            government had postponed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW1"
                                >Colby</persName> replied that the elections were similar to our
                            Congressional elections. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said that these elections were not significant
                            and would not change the composition of the government.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President’s question, <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said that the Vietnamese generals haven’t the
                            guts of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> or <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. They will not be a unified group
                            but will be badly split. They do not have real leadership, and they do
                            not control the predominant military force in the country. He expressed
                            grave doubt that the generals could carry out a clean coup in a split
                            second.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> circulated a

                            these military forces were few and scattered. He also had a list of
                            generals loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> who had
                            forces in Saigon and near at hand which they controlled. In addition,

                        <p>In response to the President’s question as to the effect of the civil
                            disturbances on the military campaign against the Viet Cong, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1">Krulak</persName> replied that the
                            effect was slight and that there had been no dramatic degradation of
                            South Vietnamese military capability.<note n="4" xml:id="d303fn4">In his
                                memorandum for the record, <persName corresp="#p_KMGVH1"
                                    >Krulak</persName> noted that he “stated that friendly

                                scale efforts, but the reduction was not as yet great; that Viet
                                Cong operations are continuing at the low level to which they had
                                dropped after the Geneva Accords offensive. <p>“The President asked
                                    if the low level of Viet Cong activity was due to the weather,
                                    to which I replied in the negative”.</p></note></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that there
                            had not been sufficient time for the Viet Cong to react by taking
                            advantage of the internal disturbances. <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662"
                                facs="0688"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> added that the effect of the unrest was limited
                            to the cities and had not yet affected the countryside. He said that
                            whatever happened in the city of Saigon would have little effect in the
                            rural areas in the long run because the peasants were uninformed and
                            interested primarily in obtaining sufficient food. Although the unrest
                            would be bound to seep down into the countryside, he doubted that the
                            rural people would be affected unless their personal security is
                            involved and unless their food supply is reduced.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question as to why the peasants were not
                            upset by Diem’s attack on the Buddhists, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that the Buddhists
                            were not organized as a religion such as we have in the West. The
                            Buddhist church in Vietnam is not a real force.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            had ever explained to us why he had not kept his promises to us.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had kept his promises.
                            He said that there was no promise made to us which he had not tried to
                            keep. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> should be given “E” for

                            <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> had said that their
                            military officers were worried by the Buddhist movement because of its
                            possible effect on fighting the war against the Viet Cong. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that on August
                            14th he thought we had won a real victory in Vietnam. He said that he
                            was not convinced at that time that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s conciliatory policy would end the unrest.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether between the 14th and the 29th of August the
                            rioting and the unrest had changed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s mind or whether <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> had lied to Nolting. <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said he believed <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            changed their minds after they had talked to him on August 14th. He said
                            they appeared to have decided to end the unrest once and for all and
                            together they had moved from conciliation to the use of force. He said
                            that they apparently had decided that conciliation would not pay off
                            because the Buddhists would not cooperate with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> after <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> had made her public attack
                            on the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question about <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu’s</persName> authority, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> himself is an able person who
                            organized and is responsible for the success of the strategic hamlet
                            program. He had been cooperative with us and was not anti-American but
                            pro-Vietnamese. He said that both <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had
                            separately denied that they were fighting each other. He predicted that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> would not be disloyal to
                            his brother and throw him out, but probably the younger man, aged 54,
                            would replace the older, who is 62. He said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> was feared by the people and by the
                            Vice President. However, he could see <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> in a position of authority because <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> can command people and the
                            Vietnamese are respectful of those who can command. In his view, the
                            Vietnamese generals had asked for martial law, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> had checked their request with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, and when the proposal
                            was approved, <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> ordered his
                            secret police to arrest the Buddhists at the same time that martial law
                            came into effect. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> acknowledged that the secret police had used
                            brutal methods but he believed they had not been ordered to do so. He
                            felt that the secret police were jumpy and therefore resorted to greater
                            use of force than was anticipated. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> cited reports <pb n="663"
                                xml:id="pg_663" facs="0689"/>that there were 1400 Buddhists arrested
                            and about 1000 students. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> that the monks were being released quietly and
                            returned to their pagodas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that the
                            group turn its attention to a list of contingencies which might face us
                            in Vietnam. He listed two. What would our position be if some generals
                            remained loyal to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and some
                            generals attempted a coup. The second dealt with what we should do if
                            the generals attempted a coup and were defeated by <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that he saw no point in trying a coup unless
                            there was a chance of its success. He asked what military support there
                            would be for a coup.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> replied that
                            military support for a coup did not now exist. There might be such
                            support if the U.S. said that the Vietnamese must get rid of <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName>. A larger number of generals would rally to a coup
                            aimed at ousting <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>. Most of the
                            generals would be reluctant to oust <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> were Siamese twins who
                            could not be forced apart. If the generals moved against <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> would go down with him in the palace, or, if he
                            escaped, return to Saigon to resist the rebel generals. Or <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> might quit the fight and leave
                            the country. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>
                            said it would be impossible to engineer separation of the two men-the
                            only possible way would be to persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> to send <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> recalled that
                            the circle had nearly been completed in a three-year period. Ambassador
                                <persName>Durbrow</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> three years ago that <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> must go. <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> refused to accept the suggestion and Durbrow was
                            removed from Vietnam. (The President recognized the irony of this
                            situation by smiling.) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> said we should not fight the internal political
                            situation in Vietnam too hard. He urged that we keep our eye on fighting
                            the Viet Cong. In his view, newspaper pressure cannot clean up the messy
                            internal politics of Vietnam which will be with us for a long time.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1"
                                >Nolting</persName> agreed that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s actions in the last few months would prevent him
                            from carrying forward the war against the Communists. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> responded that he
                            thought we should take it slow and easy over the next several weeks. It
                            is possible that the brutal surgical operation may succeed as <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> have predicted. We will take our lumps because of
                            the actions of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>, but if they succeed, we
                            will have preserved a base for the fight against the Viet Cong. If the
                            smouldering resentment of the Vietnamese people grows and begins to show
                            up in the Vietnamese military units to such an extent that the war
                            effort is blocked, then we have an entirely different problem of
                            creating an acceptable political base. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> called attention to the fact
                            that the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> agents had already told
                            some generals to <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0690"/>undertake a
                            coup. If we go back on these generals now, we will lose them. He asked
                            why we should jump unless we have some place to jump.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that we hadn’t gone so far we can’t delay. He
                            recalled that one general had said the generals needed a week to effect
                            their plans. [<hi rend="italic">1 sentence (3 lines) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> referred to Harkins’
                            estimate that the generals would delay a few days until they knew the
                            reaction of the general officers. If the general officers decided they
                            could not live with the <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            regime, then the senior officers would move forward to a coup.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he
                            believed we should ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> for an appraisal as to whether a coup by the
                            generals can be successful. If our officials doubt that the generals can
                            pull off a coup, then the generals should be cautioned not to move. The
                            danger already exists that <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> know of the generals’
                            coup planning and of U.S. interest in their plans. He believed that we
                            could slow up the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> action with the
                            generals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> said that the longer we
                            wait the harder it would be to get <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> out.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName>’ position is. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> responded that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> had never been asked
                            for his views-that he merely got orders.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that in his
                            view the crucial factor is the effect of the current unrest on the other
                            side. Does the existing unrest make it impossible to carry out the war
                            against the Viet Cong? If the Buddhists and the anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> groups do not give up their
                            attacks on <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>, how can the war
                            go on? If Vietnamese opposition to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> is great, it is very hard for us to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s question, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> evaluated the Vietnamese Vice
                            President as a respected person who was neither forceful nor
                            ambitious.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> noted that the generals did not appear
                            very forceful. He suggested that General <persName corresp="#p_HGPD1"
                                >Harkins</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHCJ1"
                                >Lodge</persName> be asked to report on the exact operational
                            situation. He believed that we should ensure that if a coup were
                            attempted and failed, there was no evidence of U.S. interest in the
                            attempt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> asked whether the
                            generals we were talking to would be able to reach an accommodation with
                            the Buddhists. He thought we should be certain that if a coup succeeded,
                            the resulting situation would be better than the present one.</p>
                        <p>The President said we should send a cable to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGPD1">Harkins</persName> asking for their estimate of
                            the prospects of a coup by the generals. They should also be asked to
                            recommend whether we should proceed with the generals or wait. He also
                            wanted their views on what we should do if the situation
                            deteriorates.</p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0691"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> commented that he would
                            not be happy if the present situation calmed down and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> got more power. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> must be forced to limit authority
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and get <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDNM1">Madame Nhu</persName> out of the country.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> would not respond if he
                            were pushed, but he could be convinced by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHCJ1">Lodge</persName> that the situation must improve
                            if we were to continue assisting Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that we
                            should obtain an immediate appraisal from the officers on the ground and
                            should ask them whether chances of a successful coup would be increased
                            by delay.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought they should also be asked whether the
                            effect would be harmful if we decided now to cut our losses.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName> said we should
                            try once again to persuade <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                            to limit the authority of <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName> and
                            to force the political liquidation of <persName corresp="#p_NDNM1"
                                >Madame Nhu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that we
                            should make clear to our officials in Saigon that we were not changing
                            their existing directive on which they had already proceeded to take
                            numerous actions.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the meeting by repeating Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_NFEJ1">Nolting</persName>’s view that the generals
                            interested in the coup were not good enough to bring it about.</p>

                        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0692"/>
                        <p>Both: The US must act firmly and quickly to replace both <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1"
                                >Nhu</persName> with a new government. The Vietnamese people are
                            aroused far more than ever before, and it is too late even to save
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as a figure-head. The
                            people, seeing <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> special forces and
                            police with US weapons and equipment, knowing that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> can only stay in power with US
                            support, will turn against the US unless there is a change of the whole
                            top of government. If the US is satisfied merely with a change of
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> policy towards
                            Buddhists and students, including release of Buddhist and student
                            prisoners, this will not change the hate of the Vietnamese people for
                            the acts already committed.</p>
                        <p>Amb. Chuong: The US will sell out the Vietnamese people to the Communists
                            if there is any truth to the story that the US is getting ready to place
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName> in as Premier under
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> as a figure-head
                            President. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Buu Hoi</persName>, with his
                            Communist connections, would be a Vietnamese version of Souvanna Phouma
                            and the Communists would take over. Admittedly, this would give the US
                            “grandeur” of looking like it was solving a hard Vietnamese problem,
                            without being directly responsible for sell-out-but the Vietnamese
                            people would know.</p>
                        <p>Mme. Chuong (privately): You must go to Saigon fast and tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu’s</persName> to leave the country now. The
                            people hate them and they shouldn’t stay for the people to kill them.
                            They will surely be killed if they stay, and nobody at the Palace now is
                            telling them how the people really feel. They are cut off from reality.
                            Why do they need power, after nine years of it, if the family is killed?
                            The US told Syngman Rhee to leave. Why not <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NHU1">Nhu</persName>?</p>
                        <p>Both: We will reside in the Embassy until Ly, the new Ambassador, arrives
                            from New Delhi, then stay in the Washington area as private citizens.

                                            The forces of the Capital Military District, headed by

                                                >ABN</gloss> Brigade, has the single most powerful
                                            and cohesive unit in Saigon. Thus, his actions are
                                            crucial to the success of initial moves. His loyalties
                                            have run to <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName>
                                            and he is close to <persName corresp="#p_DINH1"
                                                >Dinh</persName>. But he is also aware of the
                                            outspoken opposition of the bulk of his officers to the
                                            present regime. We have reports that this has caused a
                                            reorientation of his thinking and that he would
                                            immediately swing if <persName corresp="#p_DINH1"
                                                >Dinh</persName> swung, and, alternatively, that he
                                            could be persuaded to swing without <persName
                                                corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> before or in the
                                            opening stages of the revolt. If the Generals can count
                                            on the airborne, success might come quickly and with
                                            minimum violence. If not, the struggle might be bloody
                                            and extended. Under latter circumstances, estimate here
                                            is that the Generals would resort to stratagem to
                                            neutralize Vien, rather than assault forces he commands.
                                            On balance, we believe that Generals cannot count on
                                            Vien, but may have support of certain units of the
                                            brigade. Certainly, the 6th <gloss target="#t_BN1"

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">document number not declassified</hi>] Situation here
                            has reached point of no return. Saigon is armed camp. Current
                            indications are that Ngo family have dug in for last ditch battle. It is
                            our considered estimate that General officers cannot retreat now.

                            of General officers, excepting <persName corresp="#p_DINH1"
                                >Dinh</persName> and Cao, are united, have conducted prior planning,
                            realize that they must proceed quickly, and understand that they have no
                            alternative but to go forward. Unless the generals are neutralized
                            before being able to launch their operation, we believe they will act
                            and that they have good chance to win. If General <persName

                            at outset, there may be widespread fighting in Saigon and serious loss
                            of life.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that crucial stakes are involved and have no doubt that the
                            generals do also. Situation has changed drastically since 21 August. If
                            the Ngo family wins now, they and Vietnam will stagger on to final
                            defeat at the hands of their own people and the <gloss target="#t_VC1"

                            seems clear that American public opinion and Congress, as well as world

                        <p>Bloodshed can be avoided if the Ngo family would step down before the
                            coming armed action. If General <persName corresp="#p_DINH1"
                                >Dinh</persName> would join with the other Generals, it is
                            conceivable Ngo family might surrender without a final fight. Up to now,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DINH1">Dinh</persName> has remained firmly on
                            the family’s side. [2 <hi rend="italic">sentences not

                        <p>[3 <hi rend="italic">sentences not declassified</hi>] It is obviously
                            preferable that the generals conduct this effort without apparent
                            American assistance. Otherwise, for a long time in the future, they will
                            be vulnerable to charges of being American puppets, which they are not
                            in any sense. Nevertheless, we all understand that the effort must
                            succeed and that whatever needs to be done on our part must be done. If
                            this attempt by the generals does not take place or if it fails, we
                            believe it no exaggeration to say that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            runs serious risk of being lost over the course of time.</p>

                            the increasing dissatisfaction with <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1"
                                >Diem</persName>’s course in the United States.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">La Stampa</hi> (liberal, Turin) said perhaps the

                            grave.” The Vatican Osservatore Romano saw the conflict as more
                            political than religious, but the Catholic <hi rend="italic">Avvanire
                                d’Italia</hi> of Bologne said that between the <persName

                            would have to declare flatly for the Buddhists.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Die Welt</hi> (independent, Hamburg) called on

                            regime fall, and to “establish contact with the non-communist

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Scotsman</hi> (conservative) speculated that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> was forcing the U.S. to
                            look for new Vietnamese leadership. The London <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>News coverage has been unusually heavy in Ceylon and India. Editorialists
                            in those countries, Iran, Pakistan, and Lebanon are universally critical
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DIEM1">Diem</persName> and the United States
                            for keeping him in power. There is growing sentiment in Ceylon and India

                        <p>The Ceylon <hi rend="italic">Observer</hi> flatly accused the U.S. of
                            being “committed, to the cynical view that it matters not whom it hires
                            to engage the enemy in the outlying marshes if they will help to keep
                            Fortress America safe.” Critical comments by Buddhist leaders in Ceylon
                            have been widely reported, including one to the effect that the
                            “dollar-Vatican axis” is responsible for the events in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Times of India</hi> credited the U.S. with a “large
                            part of the blame” for the situation, and said that “one would have
                            thought that after what happened in South Korea… the U.S. State
                            Department would have realized that the communists’ worst enemies are
                            not necessarily democracy’s best friends.”</p>
