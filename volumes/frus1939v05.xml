                        <p>There is now pending in the Congress the Joint Resolution to authorize

                            when they so request, with certain military and naval matériel for
                            defense purposes (please see press release no. 96<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1">See Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press

                            no. 60 of March 14 last, and subsequent bulletins especially no. 68 of
                            March 23). We believe it would be useful in that connection to be able
                            definitely to state to members of the respective Congressional
                            committees that information has been received indicating that the other
                            American republics would welcome the enactment of the Resolution, and to
                            that end I desire you to seek an early opportunity for an informal and
                            confidential discussion of the matter with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs of the country to which you are accredited. The information
                            already transmitted to you describes the scope and objectives of the
                            Resolution. Its primary purpose is to extend the area of our cooperation
                            to the field of defense and we believe that the measure is entirely
                            consistent with the good neighbor policy and with the official
                            declarations unanimously adopted at the Conferences in Buenos Aires in

                            March, have provided added reason for preoccupation on the part of the

                                    information relative to defense only (that is specifically naval

                                    no suggestion that any country should increase its armament. The
                                    initiative in every instance will come from a country desiring
                                    our cooperation.</item>

                                    without expense to the United States. It will of course be our

                            legislation is “vitally necessary;” also Brazil has been waiting for it
                            for some time and has a particular interest therein in connection with
                            the guns promised for the destroyers which are now under construction

                            him an informal memorandum in the sense of the Department’s instruction.
                            The Minister read it in my presence, inquired as to one or two points,
                            thanked me for presenting the matter for his consideration and stated
                            that he would study it, discuss the subject with other members of the
                            government and would give me a statement in a few days, stating that he
                            observed that such statement would be for the confidential information

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s circular telegram of June 27—7 p.m.
                            instructing me to discuss informally and confidentially with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs the information in the Department’s
                            telegram concerning the joint resolution now before Congress providing
                            for our cooperation with the other Republics of America in supplying
                            them on their request certain naval and military material for purposes
                            of defense. In accordance with the Department’s instruction the comments
                            of the Foreign Minister were solicited and, as reported in my telephone
                            conversation of June 28 with Mr. Chapin,<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">Selden Chapin, Assistant Chief, Division of the American
                                Republics.</note> he did not hesitate to assure me that his
                            Government naturally viewed with favor any such resolution. The points
                            in the Department’s telegram were explained carefully to the Minister
                            who expressed great interest in the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Dominican Republic, as the Department is aware, has at various times
                            sought from us military and naval material, and the joint resolution
                            would no doubt cause further inquiries on its part.</p>

                            facilities should prove a handy thing for all the American Republics.
                            However, owing to the isolated geographical position and financial
                            condition of his country, he did not feel free to express an active
                            interest therein by Paraguay at the moment but promised me a further
                            statement after consulting with the President.</p>

                            desired to present the matter to the President before expressing an
                            opinion. Minister of Foreign Affairs has just orally declared that the
                            Panaman Government enthusiastically endorses the plan to extend the
                            facilities of American Government owned yards and arsenals to the other
                            American Republics. He added that such a policy is not only necessary
                            but also indispensable in the present state of world affairs.</p>

                            merely an informal indication of the attitude of the Uruguayan

                        <p>18. Referring to my telegram No. 17, June 30, 6 p.m. The Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs today informed me that President Paiva believes that
                            making available the proposed facilities to the American Republics is
                            desirable but that for the reasons given in my telegram referred to
                            Paraguay’s interest for the moment is obviously academic.</p>

                        <p>49. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 39 July 5. Since my
                            telegram No. 46, June 28, I took the opportunity on two different social
                            occasions to mention the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            each time he assured me that a statement would soon be forthcoming. On
                            receipt of the Department’s telegram No. 39, I obtained an interview
                            with the Minister for Foreign Affairs for this afternoon stating, as I
                            did on each previous occasion, that no official and formal statement was
                            necessary and that only an indication of the views of the Uruguayan
                            Government is desired. The Minister stated that the matter has been
                            under serious consideration from the moment of our first interview and
                            that it is one on which he must first confer with the President, the
                            Minister of National Defense, and certain technical advisers. The
                            Minister said that he has appointments tomorrow with the President and
                            the Minister of National Defense and promised to give me a statement at
                            noon Saturday, July 8, at which time I am to call at the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs. I shall telegraph immediately thereafter.</p>

                        <p>20. Department’s circular telegram of June 27, 7 p.m. The Foreign
                            Minister informed me today under instructions from the President: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That Guatemala did not wish to buy any war material in the
                                    United States at the present time inasmuch as it already has
                                    sufficient material available for its peacetime needs.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That in the event of war Guatemala expected to cooperate with
                                    the United States as it did during the World War. In this case
                                    if necessary it could put from 100,000 to 200,000 well trained
                                    men in the field. It has at present equipment for a maximum of
                                    100,000; but little of this is modern. It would consequently
                                    require equipment for the men to be put in the field and it
                                    trusted that inasmuch as such a war presumably would be one in
                                    which Guatemala would be involved through solidarity with the
                                    United States, the United States would be willing to furnish the
                                    necessary equipment without cost to Guatemala.</item>

                                <item>That Guatemala had no objection to the general plan of selling
                                    war material to other Latin American Republics.</item>

                        <p>50. Your no. 57, June 28, 5 p.m. No formal statement is required for the
                            purposes outlined in the Department’s circular telegram of June 27 but
                            merely an informal indication of the attitude of the Venezuelan
                            Government. Nearly all replies have been received and all have been
                            favorable.</p>

                        <p>In the event that the Government of Argentina is willing to join in the
                            request for consultation, this Government suggests that the request for
                            consultation might well be phrased as follows, and that it might be

                        <p>170. For the Ambassador from the Under Secretary. Your 303, September 5,
                            5 p.m. While no announcement will be made for the moment, you may inform
                            Aranha confidentially that I myself will represent this Government at
                            the Panama Conference. Please express my earnest hope that Aranha may
                            find it possible to go because of the increased prestige and importance
                            which will be given the Conference by his presence. You may add that the
                            President has instructed me to say that should he desire to proceed by
                            airplane to Trinidad and find it convenient in order to arrive in Panama
                            on the date set for the Conference, the President will order a United
                            States cruiser to be available at Trinidad in order to transport such
                            delegate to Panama. Similar offers will be made to the delegates of
                            Uruguay and of Paraguay. [Welles.]</p>

                        <p>For the Conference of the American Republics to be held in Panama,
                            September 21, the Department has prepared the tentative agenda quoted
                            hereafter.</p>
                        <p>You are requested immediately to present a copy of the suggested agenda
                            to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country to which you are
                            accredited. In presenting it, you should state that because <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0027"/>of the emergency and in order to advance
                            as rapidly as possible preparations for the Conference by each
                            Government, this Government felt it might be helpful in making these
                            suggestions for the consideration of the other Governments. You should
                            also state that the basic consideration which this Government had in
                            mind when it drew up the suggested agenda was the desirability of
                            confining it strictly to questions arising out of the war in Europe.
                            These questions, which may be summarized under the headings of (1)
                            Neutrality, (2) Protection of the Peace of the Western Hemisphere, and
                            (3) Measures to Safeguard the Economic and Financial Stability of the
                            American Republics, are of an urgent character requiring very prompt
                            attention and in some cases immediate action. In order that the
                            Conference may achieve its purpose it is obvious that it must adhere
                            closely to the problems presently confronting all the countries of this
                            Hemisphere because of the war, so that you will discourage discreetly
                            any suggestions for the addition of questions not directly pertinent to
                            the purposes of this Conference.</p>
                        <p>In order that decision regarding the agenda may be reached as quickly as
                            possible, it is suggested that the views of the Government to which you
                            are accredited be communicated as rapidly as possible through you to the
                            Department. It is suggested that the final views of all the governments
                            be presented to the Governing Board of the Pan American Union for the
                            approval of a final agenda at a special meeting to be held on September
                            12 at 3 o’clock. It is hoped that under the foregoing procedure the
                            introduction of any subject not strictly germane can be avoided so that
                            the meeting of the Board will in effect be limited to a ratification of
                            the agenda previously discussed and agreed upon.</p>

                        <p>95. Department’s rush circular September 6, 6 p.m. The Foreign Minister
                            is unconvinced of the need of holding a conference at this time
                            particularly without adequate preparation but informs me that <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0029"/>Venezuela will participate and that the
                            Venezuelan Minister to Panama will probably be named as representative.
                            He expressed the view that holding a conference so soon after the
                            outbreak of war may prejudice future efforts at concerted action if a
                            real emergency should develop. He has no observations whatever to make
                            with respect to the proposed agenda.</p>

                        <p>104. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that replies have now
                            been received from all of the 12 Republics invited and that all are
                            favorable with the possible exception of Venezuela whose Government
                            requested certain information but failed to specify whether it would
                            participate. He has asked the Venezuelan Minister here to telegraph his
                            Government in order to clear up the matter. The Panamanian Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs tells me also that thus far the Ministers of Foreign
                            Affairs of Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico,
                            Nicaragua, and Peru have signified their intention of being present and
                            that it appears from their replies that the Bolivian, Mexican, and
                            Peruvian Foreign Ministers are planning to be here about September 19.
                            Does the Department wish me to transmit information as it becomes
                            available regarding the representatives to be designated by other
                            governments and does it desire also the names of advisers, experts, et
                            cetera, who will accompany them?</p>

                        <p>79. Personal for the Ambassador from the Under Secretary. Your 95,
                            September 9, 1 p.m. Please see the Minister for Foreign Affairs as soon
                            as possible and tell him that while I am most happy to know that
                            Venezuela will participate in the Panama meeting and that we may thereby
                            have the invaluable benefit of the assistance and cooperation of the
                            Government of Venezuela in the deliberations of the meeting, I am
                            somewhat concerned as to the reasons for the feeling expressed to you by
                            the Minister that he is “unconvinced of the need of holding a conference
                            at this time.” It has seemed to this Government that the outbreak of any
                            general European war clearly constitutes a potential menace to the peace
                            of this continent and it was for that <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0030"/>reason that this Government strongly supported the idea
                            of an early consultation as provided for in the Convention and
                            Declaration of Buenos Aires and in the Declaration of Lima. Prior to the
                            declaration of war, several governments had approached the Government of
                            the United States indicating their belief that consultation should take
                            place as provided for in the Convention of Buenos Aires, and others
                            publicly announced their belief in the same sense. Immediately after the
                            declaration of war, this Government informed the governments referred to
                            that it was ready to join in a request for consultation and suggested
                            that the Government of Panama be the intermediary in this case.</p>
                        <p>If there had been more time available, this Government would have
                            immediately undertaken an exchange of views with the Government of
                            Venezuela, but in view of the urgency of the situation and in view of
                            the most helpful and cooperative attitude always shown by the Government
                            of Venezuela in all questions affecting the welfare of the continent and
                            particularly in view of the position taken by the Government of
                            Venezuela in both the Buenos Aires and the Lima Conferences, this
                            Government assumed that the Government of Venezuela would coincide in
                            its own belief that consultation at the earliest possible date would be
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>Please say to the Minister that I personally had hoped that I might have
                            the privilege of working with him at the Panama meeting and that I still
                            hope there may be some chance that he may find it possible to attend in
                            representation of his Government. You may add that there is no statesman
                            on the continent whose presence at Panama would, in my judgment, be more
                            conducive to an outcome of the meeting which would prove in the highest
                            interest of all the American Republics. [Welles.]</p>

                            of Panama to telegraph all countries suggesting that the definite date
                            for convening the conference be September 23. Please make this
                            suggestion to the Panamanian Government and reply by telegraph.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your telegram 104, September 9, 5 p.m., please report
                            by cable to reach Washington by morning of September 14 names of
                            delegates, advisers, et cetera, who will represent the other American
                            Republics.</p>

                            Minister for Foreign Affairs “that the Pan American Union should be
                            authorized by all the American republics to propose to the belligerents
                            that certain sections of the southern Atlantic and Pacific should be
                            closed to naval warfare and that the belligerents should come to some
                            arrangement with the Union as to the protection of neutral shipping”.

                        <p>98. Department’s 79, September 11, 5 p.m. The complimentary references of
                            the Under Secretary were conveyed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and
                            were received with appreciation. The Foreign Minister in turn sends a
                            message of friendship and affection to the Under Secretary. He fervently

                            1916 for a conference of American Republics to discuss situation created
                            by German submarine campaign (see Embassy’s despatch 113 of September
                                8,<note n="20" xml:id="d52fn20">Not printed.</note> which should
                            reach the Department today). The Minister for Foreign Affairs is
                            examining the files here to give me further data on this proposal which
                            was apparently distinct from the proposal referred to in the
                            Department’s telegram No. 151. In the meantime I am endeavoring
                            discreetly to obtain further information on 1914 proposal through the
                            Foreign Office.<note n="21" xml:id="d52fn21">In despatch No. 136,
                                September 19, the Ambassador in Argentina reported: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It now appears that Dr. Cantilo was mistaken in his
                                        recollection of what transpired in 1916. What he apparently
                                        had in mind were the 1914 proposals and the action resulting
                                        therefrom which continued on up to 1916. In other words, the
                                        Argentine Government does not appear to have made any new
                                        proposals in 1916 to meet the situation resulting from the
                                        German unrestricted submarine warfare, as Dr. Cantilo had
                                        thought” (740.00111 A.R./360)</p>

                        <p>In connection with the resolution which Mr. Welles intends to present at
                            Panama for a neutral zone around the Americas, with the exception of the
                            territorial waters of European possessions, the Department has
                            ascertained that there are at the present time in ports of the American
                            Republics approximately 82 German vessels. There is one German vessel in
                            United States ports. Their distribution is indicated on the attached
                            tabulation.</p>
                        <p>Under the proposed arrangement it would be possible for all of these
                            vessels to engage in carrying goods between the American Republics free
                            from search and seizure by the war vessels of Great Britain and France.
                            A difficult problem of patrol may be presented, since these vessels
                            might serve as mother ships to supply German submarines just at the edge
                            of the neutral zone.</p>
                        <p>There is also the problem of these vessels being clandestinely fitted out
                            as raiders and then of their attacking merchant shipping outside of the
                            zone, returning within the zone in order to escape attack of the war
                            vessels of Great Britain and France.</p>

                                Lothian.</note> called at his own request. He said he came in to
                            inquire about that feature of the present Pan American meeting relating
                            to a so-called safety zone around this hemisphere. He said that, of
                            course, his Government stands for the well-established principle of
                            international law relating to the freedom of the seas and the rights of
                            both neutrals and belligerents to utilize the sea as a public highway
                            open to all alike, and that, therefore, his Government is naturally
                            interested in this pending proposal at Panama. I replied that the matter
                            at present is in the developing stage; that whatever our attitude may
                            later be, it was my understanding that the present plan contemplates a
                            patrol system similar to the present patrol system of this Government
                            from opposite the Canadian border to the lower end of the Caribbean Sea;
                            that, in addition to this patrol plan, the Pan American proposal at
                            Panama probably contemplates that the 21 American republics, after
                            declaring a purpose jointly to patrol the sea a considerable distance
                            from shore and entirely around this hemisphere to the Canadian border,
                            will request belligerent governments to agree not to engage in any act
                            of hostilities within this so-called safety zone of the ocean; that if
                            either or both belligerents should refuse thus to agree, the 21 American
                            republics would go forward with their patrol work, and, in the event
                            there should be acts of hostilities on the part of any belligerent
                            within the so-called safety zone, the American republics would proceed
                            to confer, with the view to determining what step or steps they might
                            take to deal with such a situation; that no specific method of so
                            dealing with such hostile acts will be discussed or agreed upon in
                            advance by the American republics. I added that, of course, if one
                            belligerent should agree to the request aforementioned it would do so oh
                            condition that an opposing belligerent would likewise agree and would
                            carry out this promise; that if the opposing belligerent should violate
                            its promise and if the 21 American republics should fail to deal
                            effectively or satisfactorily <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0036"/>with such violation, then Great Britain might feel constrained to come
                            into the safety zone and deal with it herself. I stated that, of course,
                            the request would contemplate that both sides must agree to comply and
                            both sides must carry out the agreement in order for it to be operative;
                            that this proposal would except, from the safety zone plan, British
                            possessions in this hemisphere. I then added that, of course, the 21
                            American republics would be specially interested in keeping submarines
                            from Europe away from this hemisphere and away from any base of supplies
                            in this hemisphere; that in harmony with this spirit it was not
                            improbable that Congress might prohibit submarines from coming into
                            harbors of the United States for any purpose. The Ambassador seemed
                            satisfied with this general proposal provided both sides agree to it and
                            carry out their agreement and provided it does not interfere with
                            British access to British colonies and other possessions lying and
                            situate within this proposed so-called safety zone. I stated that the
                            proposal would naturally make an exception with respect to access on the
                            part of the British to British possessions in this hemisphere.</p>

                        <p>24. According to our latest data, at the present time there are at least
                            80 German vessels in the ports of the American republics and Dutch
                            possessions. Under the terms as they now stand of the proposed
                            declaration establishing the so-called safety zone, these vessels and
                            any other German vessels that might slip into ports of the American
                            countries could engage in coast wise trade within the zone. This
                            possibility raises a number of important questions. For instance, the
                            entry into the carrying trade between the Americas of all of these ships
                            might create serious complications and hardship for American shipping
                            regularly engaged in this service. Moreover, considering the large
                            number of vessels involved, what attitude might be expected from the
                            British and French who seem intent upon bottling up in port all German
                            shipping.</p>
                        <p>Would you be good enough to give me the thoughts you may have on these
                            and any other related questions?</p>

                        <p>20. Your 24, September 27, 10 p.m. I have had the matter mentioned in
                            your telegram very much in mind from the beginning of our consideration
                            of the proposed restricted zone around this continent and if I remember
                            correctly discussed it with you and with the President.</p>
                        <p>It is of course clear that if the proposed restricted zone is established
                            and respected by the belligerents both Germany and the allies will
                            derive certain advantages as well as disadvantages therefrom. From the
                            standpoint of possible advantages to the allies the security of their
                            ships carrying supplies of raw materials from the South American
                            Republics to their own ports so long as they remain within the
                            restrictive zone would be a very great gain. They would derive even
                            greater benefits from the fact that if the restricted zone is respected
                            they would be enabled to reduce materially their naval patrols within
                            such areas as well as from the fact that their colonial possessions
                            within the restricted zone would be far less liable to incur any danger.
                            The sole disadvantage to the allies which I can see derives from the
                            relative advantage to Germany which would result from the security of
                            German merchant ships now within the restricted zone which would be
                            enabled as you indicate to engage in coastwise shipping.</p>
                        <p>As you know there is already under way a movement on the part of some of
                            the American governments to attempt to take over these German merchant
                            vessels and if this is done there is no doubt that the allied
                            governments would immediately raise the question as to the validity of
                            such transfer of title during the war period. If we sustain the general
                            proposal for the creation of a restricted zone on the ground that the
                            American Republics are entitled to continue normal shipping
                            communications with each other notwithstanding the outbreak of war in
                            Europe it would seem to me that there would necessarily be inherent in
                            such proposal the right of all belligerents to engage in maritime
                            communications between the American Republics so long as their merchant
                            ships kept within a reasonable distance of our coasts. The great fear of
                            many of the American Republics which has been expressed to me in my
                            conversations here and particularly in conversations with the
                            representatives of the Pacific Coast republics is that the sharp
                            reduction in British shipping from South American ports to Europe caused
                            by the outbreak of war cannot within any foreseeable period be
                            compensated for by any commensurate increase in American merchant ships.
                            The unanimous <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0038"/>tendency on the
                            part of these republics will be to insist that German ships be permitted
                            to continue inter-American trade whether under German flags or under the
                            flags of some of these republics themselves after transfer of title.</p>
                        <p>I realize the complicated nature of this problem but so far as my own
                            opinion is concerned I have reached the very definite conclusion that
                            from the standpoint of preserving so far as possible healthy trade and
                            commerce between the American Republics notwithstanding the outbreak of
                            war the disadvantages resulting from the creation of the restricted zone
                            would be far less than the advantages to be derived therefrom; I need
                            hardly emphasize the fact that as is clearly stated in the project the
                            restricted zone would only continue so long as all of the American
                            Republics retained their present neutral status.</p>

                        <p>32. For the Under Secretary from Berle. Your 20, September 28, 4 p.m.
                            Have discussed the proposed line with the Navy Department and with the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The President has in mind a patrol line under which the Argentine, Brazil
                            and ourselves in cooperation patrol from a point just below Mar del
                            Plata to the northern boundary of the United States. He believes that
                            the Argentine government might be persuaded to take on patrolling part
                            of the Brazilian coast to a point south of Rio and the Brazilians from
                            there on as far north as they could, but probably to a point off Natal,
                            and that they would have to invite us to share patrolling from there
                            north to the southern terminus of our own patrol. Such patrols would be
                            chiefly by destroyers, seaplanes, etc. In the event that focal areas
                            required special patrolling, necessary measures might be worked out in
                            consultation. This would require that arrangements be made by which
                            Brazil would invite us to patrol a portion of her area and Brazilians
                            and Argentines mutually agree on patrolling from Mar del Plata
                            north.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of the patrol would be to prevent establishment of
                            submarine bases and to assure that unneutral use of these coasts was not
                            made by any belligerent. A possible measure might be understanding that
                            unneutral use of the coast of any of the American republics would be
                            considered as an unneutral use of the coast of all American republics,
                            so that a ship acting unneutrally from an Argentine base might be
                            interned if she entered a Brazilian port or the like.</p>
                        <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0039"/>
                        <p>The problem of German merchant vessels now blockaded in Latin American
                            harbors has likewise been discussed. The probable provisions of the new
                            Neutrality Act will be such as to release a great many American vessels
                            which would promptly seek to enter Latin American trade, and for this
                            reason it is not thought that the German vessels will be needed to
                            maintain communications with the Latin American republics. Further, both
                            the Navy and the Department are impressed by the obvious dangers of
                            allowing German ships with German crews to engage extensively in the
                            coastwise continental trade. The President does not believe it
                            advantageous to create a situation permitting these ships to operate
                            freely in the restricted zone.</p>
                        <p>British Embassy has indicated to us that it will not recognize title to
                            German ships transferred to neutral flags, and will insist on right to
                            capture German ships in any event. Nevertheless, it is contemplated that
                            representations may be made to the British suggesting that German ships
                            taken over by neutrals and put into the trans-Atlantic trade may be of
                            great importance to them in view of the provisions of the Neutrality
                            Act, and we plan further discussions with the British on this point.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it seems to me, first, that the resolution as
                            drafted textually may stand, but that the limitation on hostile acts
                            might be so handled as not to release German vessels now immobilized
                            unless or until arrangements are made to take over the blockaded
                            vessels. The consultation committee might be so set up as to remain in
                            continuous contact with a view to determining any particular areas,
                            ports or lanes in which belligerent activities interrupted
                            inter-American communications and in any such case measures might be
                            devised for ending activities by diplomatic or naval action, or both.

                        <p>36. For the President and Secretary. I am deeply gratified to be enabled
                            to report that a final agreement was reached today by the meeting upon
                            all of the remaining proposals submitted. From the commencement of the
                            discussions there has been complete harmony and an exact identity of
                            criterion on the part of all of the delegations.</p>
                        <p>The four points contained in the declaration providing for the restricted
                            zone around the American Republics were agreed upon in precisely the
                            form approved by the Department. No suggestion was <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0040"/>made by the Argentine delegation or any
                            other delegation for a change in the extent of the zone.</p>
                        <p>The delegations of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru have
                            indicated their desire to purchase the German merchant ships which have
                            taken refuge in their respective ports. I believe of course that it
                            would be exceedingly necessary that steps on this character be taken
                            promptly in order to eliminate the danger of a large number of German
                            merchant vessels undertaking inter-American maritime service.</p>
                        <p>A general agreement on the norms of neutrality measures was likewise
                            reached in what in my judgment constitutes an exceedingly desirable
                            form. A considerable number of other declarations and resolutions were
                            adopted none of them, however, of any peculiar significance other than
                            one providing for the establishment of inter-American police contacts so
                            as to guard against the danger of agents of the belligerents undertaking
                            concerted subversive activities in the territory of any American
                            republic.</p>
                        <p>Full texts of all of the declarations and resolutions adopted will be
                            sent to the Department by air mail.</p>

                        <p>The history of the Declaration of Panama map, preceding the meeting of the
                            Foreign Ministers of the American Republics in Panama, follows:</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Division of the American Republics in the State Department
                            the Office of the Geographer laid down on National Geographic Society maps of
                            the Western Hemisphere, at different times, the limits of waters within 500,
                            700, 1,000 and then finally 300 nautical miles of all of the 21 American
                            Republics, including their island possessions—and excluding Canada,
                            Newfoundland, and the colonies of European countries in the Americas. The
                            300-mile limit was regarded as being adequate, and the arcs of 300-mile radius
                            were then laid down on a U. S. Hydrographic Office chart of the world, taking
                            into account the latitude variations in scale oh the Mercator chart. That chart,
                            with only the 300-mile arcs (as shown within the shaded areas on the
                            accompanying map) was sent to President Roosevelt.</p>
                        <p>The President selected turning points of a provisional zone, which he identified
                            with small “x” marks in pencil, and lettered them from “A” to “L”. He then drew
                            straight lines with a ruler between those points. The map was returned to the
                            geographer of the Department with a request that the zone provisionally laid
                            down by President Roosevelt be shown on a well drafted map, and described
                            textually. In order to facilitate description some of the turning points were
                            slightly moved. The parallels of latitude serving as northern limits of the
                            zone, on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides, are the latitudes of the termini
                            of the U. S.-Canada boundary, as defined in the joint reports of the Boundary
                            Commissioners; all of the other turning points were assumed to be points at
                            integral numbers of degrees nearest the President’s lettered turning points. The
                            limits of the gray shaded areas, on the accompanying map, precisely coincide
                            with the lines thus modified from the President’s preliminary lines. Wherever
                            the limiting lines do not follow a meridian or a parallel they are defined as
                            “rhumb lines,” which means that they follow a continuous true compass course
                            between the points concerned, and that the lines are straight lines on a
                            Mercator projection.</p>
                        <p>The textual description of the zone is given in the Declaration of Panama,
                            printed on <ref target="#pg_36">page 36</ref>.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that there was no point “D” on the map in President Roosevelt’s
                            notation. Also that the point “H” was ignored in laying down the modified
                            limits; the 300-mile arc beside which President Roosevelt marked “H” had been
                            incorrectly laid down by the draftsman, from a spot on the map which had been
                            mistaken for the Chilean island “Mas Afuera.” The Hawaiian Islands, two Chilean
                            islands, Easter Island and Sala y Gomez Islands, and other distant islands, were
                            ignored in laying down the 300-mile arcs on which the zone was based.</p>
                        <p>The waters within three nautical miles of Bermuda, Jamaica, the Guianas, and
                            other European territorial possessions were excluded from the zone described in
                            the Declaration of Panama. They could not be excluded from the shaded area of
                            the map because of the smallness of the scale.</p>
                        <p>The map, as printed and sent to Panama for use at the meeting of the Foreign
                            Ministers, showed the shaded area, with the latitude and longitude of turning
                            points, and the English and Spanish notes, as shown on the accompanying map, but
                            without the 300-mile arcs there shown, and without the “x” marks and letters
                            which had been added (on another map) by President Roosevelt.</p>

                        <p>The Governments of the American Republics meeting at Panamá, have
                            solemnly ratified their neutral status in the conflict which is
                            disrupting the peace of Europe, but the present war may lead to
                            unexpected results which may affect the fundamental interests of America
                            and there can be no justification for the interests of the belligerents
                            to prevail over the rights of neutrals causing disturbances and
                            suffering to nations which by their neutrality in the conflict and their
                            distance from the scene of events, should not be burdened with its fatal
                            and painful consequences.</p>
                        <p>During the World War of 1914–1918 the Governments of Argentina, Brazil,
                            Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru advanced, or supported, individual
                            proposals providing in principle a declaration by the American Republics
                            that the belligerent nations must refrain from committing hostile acts
                            within a reasonable distance from their shores.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the present conflagration, in spite of its already
                            lamentable proportions, would not justify any obstruction to
                            inter-American communications which, engendered by important interests,
                            call for adequate protection. This fact requires the demarcation of a
                            zone of security including all the normal maritime routes of
                            communication and trade between the countries of America.</p>
                        <p>To this end it is essential as a measure of necessity to adopt
                            immediately provisions based on the above-mentioned precedents for the
                            safeguarding of such interests, in order to avoid a repetition of the
                            damages and sufferings sustained by the American nations and by their
                            citizens in the war of 1914–1918.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that the Governments of the American Republics must
                            foresee those dangers and as a measure of self-protection insist that
                            the waters to a reasonable distance from their Coasts shall remain free
                            from the commission of hostile acts or from the undertaking of
                            belligerent activities by nations engaged in a war in which the said
                            governments are not involved.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons the Governments of the American Republics Resolve and
                            Hereby Declare:</p>
                           <p>1. As a measure of continental self-protection, the American
                                        Republics, so long as they maintain their neutrality, are as
                                        of inherent right entitled to have those waters adjacent to
                                        the American continent, which they regard as of primary
                                        concern and direct utility in their relations, free from the
                                        commission of any hostile act by any non-American
                                        belligerent nation, whether such hostile act be attempted or
                                        made from land, sea or air.</p>
                                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0045"/>
                                    <p>Such waters shall be defined as follows. All waters comprised
                                        within the limits set forth hereafter except the territorial
                                        waters of Canada and of the undisputed colonies and
                                        possessions of European countries within these limits:</p>
                                    <p>Beginning at the terminus of the United States-Canada
                                        boundary in Passamaquoddy Bay, in 44°46´36″ north latitude,

                                <p>2. The Governments of the American Republics agree that they will
                                    endeavor, through joint representation to such belligerents as
                                    may now or in the future be engaged in hostilities, to secure
                                    the compliance by them with the provisions of this Declaration,
                                    without prejudice to the exercise of the individual rights of
                                    each State inherent in their sovereignty.</p>
                                <p>3. The Governments of the American Republics further declare that
                                    whenever they consider it necessary they will consult together
                                    to determine upon the measures which they may individually or
                                    collectively undertake in order to secure the observance of the
                                    provisions of this Declaration.</p>
                                <p>4. The American Republics, during the existence of a state of war
                                    in which they themselves are not involved, may undertake,
                                    whenever they may determine that the need therefor exists, to
                                    patrol, either individually or collectively, as may be agreed
                                    upon by common consent, and in so far as the means and resources
                                    of each may permit, the waters adjacent to their coasts within
                                    the area above defined. (Approved, October 3, 1939.)</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the Acting
                            Chief of the political section of the Foreign Office, Señor Enrique
                            Gajardo, informed me this morning that Chile’s only hesitation
                            respecting the three hundred <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0046"/>mile
                            safety zone agreed upon by the Pan American Conference had arisen from
                            the opinion of the Chilean Navy that the latter would not be able
                            effectively to patrol the extensive ocean areas which the zone
                            establishes. The Navy last week expressed the view that a fifty mile
                            zone would be much more practicable. As assurances were received by the
                            Chilean delegation at Panama, however, from Under Secretary Welles, that
                            each country would be expected only to effect such patrol measures as
                            its naval resources permit, the Chilean Government was glad to accept
                            the proposal. He indicated that the Declaration of Panama regarding the
                            safety zone is to be communicated to all the belligerent Governments by
                            the president of the Conference; and expressed the opinion that Germany
                            would be fully as ready to accept it as would England and France.</p>
                        <p>Much interest has been aroused at Santiago by the possibility that the
                            German merchant ships which have sought refuge in Chilean harbors might
                            navigate freely within the safety zone. This would be to the advantage
                            of Germany, but would also be beneficial to Chilean commerce. The
                            decision of Panama that the merchant ships of belligerents in Latin
                            American ports might be transferred to Latin American ownership if the
                            sales are bona fide is of some relevance; but it is doubtful whether
                            Chile possesses sufficient German exchange or funds to put through
                            genuine purchases of the six vessels now in her ports. Some of the
                            leading American mineral enterprises in Chile would be pleased to see
                            such a transfer take place, or to learn that the regulations in
                            connection with the establishment of the safety zone will permit German
                            vessels to operate without danger throughout the western hemisphere.
                            Señor Gajardo stated that his Government has not as yet given this
                            question protracted or thorough consideration.</p>
                        <p>It may be mentioned that Señor Gajardo drafted the instructions to the
                            Chilean delegation to Panama, with the approval of the Foreign Minister,
                            which is said at all times to have been readily forthcoming. He states
                            that no difficulties of any consequence arose, from a Chilean
                            standpoint, during the Conference. The Chilean delegation under
                            instructions from its Government, he feels, was able to cooperate
                            cordially and without differences of opinion in the deliberations of the
                            Panama Conference; which he considers to have been eminently successful.
                            From such cursory attention as the Embassy has found time to devote to
                            the Santiago press during the past week it would appear that the public
                            reaction to the labors of the Conference has not been very active; but
                            that it has been favorable, except that the Nacista-Socialist <hi rend="italic">El Trabajo</hi> attacks the results as representing
                            one more advance for imperialism.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador<note n="25" xml:id="d62fn25">Count de
                                Saint-Quentin.</note> called at his own request. He made some
                            reference to the so-called safety zone around this hemisphere as
                            suggested by the Panama Conference during this week. I made it clear to
                            him that it was really just an extension to the lower end of the
                            Caribbean of our present patrol policy in the Atlantic opposite this
                            country; that it simply further implemented the consultative peace pacts
                            of Buenos Aires and Lima; that there were no implications of the use of
                            force in any of these consultative pacts, from the Buenos Aires
                            Conference to and including that in Panama; that this Government in no
                            event contemplates the use of force unless and until it is first
                            attacked; that there is no plan or purpose to break down or destroy
                            international law; that it is deemed important that this and other
                            American nations should know something of what is going on as far out in
                            the ocean as any activities might be calculated to affect the national
                            security of the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador seemed to be satisfied, and added that his Government had
                            not requested him to make any inquiry or representations.</p>

                            referred the message to his responsible Ministers.<note n="26" xml:id="d63fn26">On October 16, the Panamanian Minister for Foreign

                        <p>43. The Economic and Financial Advisory Committee agreed upon at Panama
                            is to be a permanent body which will turn its attention to any and all
                            questions of inter-American relationships in these fields in which it
                            may appear that useful result is to be expected. The meeting scheduled
                            at Guatemala is one of treasury representatives for purpose of technical
                            discussion and interchange; there is no expectation that any agreements
                            will be reached at Guatemala or any negotiations undertaken.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that the Guatemala meeting in carrying on the discussion and
                            interchange on the topics in its agenda could do a useful job in
                            defining the tasks in the monetary and financial field that the
                            permanent committee could undertake and perhaps mail recommendations to
                            it. I see no reason why this meeting should be delayed.<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">First meeting of the Finance Ministers of the

                            paragraph. As you will recall, the general neutrality resolution
                            provides for the election by the Governing Board of the Pan American
                            Union of an inter-American neutrality committee composed of seven
                            members. The Governing Board has designated a subcommittee to recommend
                            to the full Board suggestions as to the manner in which the subcommittee
                            should be selected. The subcommittee is composed of the Argentine and
                            Venezuelan Ambassadors and the Guatemalan Minister. I am informed by the
                            members of this subcommittee that they desire to suggest that the
                            neutrality committee be composed of representatives of the same
                            countries now represented on the committee of jurisconsults which is
                            undertaking a study of the codification of international law. There are
                            now six members on this committee of jurisconsults representing the
                            United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0054"/>If this procedure is adopted by
                            the Governing Board, Brazil will consequently obtain a representative on
                            the neutrality committee. The seventh member to be appointed would
                            presumably be a representative of Venezuela in recognition of the fact
                            that Venezuela was the author of the project providing for the
                            appointment of the neutrality committee.</p>

                                General, Brazilian Foreign Office.</note> that this Government will

                        <p>During his call on me, the Brazilian Ambassador requested the support of
                            the United States Government in favor of Rio de Janeiro as the meeting
                            place for the Inter-American Neutrality Committee, as created by
                            paragraph five of the General Declaration of Neutrality of the American
                            Republics at Panama. I spoke at length about the friendship of my
                            country for his and the desire of my Government always to be cooperative
                            in every feasible manner, etc., etc. I said then that I should say to
                            him confidentially that the subcommittee of the Pan American Union,
                            recently appointed to study the manner of selecting the seven members of
                            the Inter-American Neutrality Committee, were rumored to have their
                            report completed for the meeting on November first of the Governing
                            Board; that the report suggests that each of the six countries
                            represented on the Committee of Experts on the Codification of
                            International Law be invited to choose one member of the Neutrality
                            Committee, and that the host Government, when known, shall be invited to
                            choose the seventh member.</p>
                        <p>I added that this would probably bring on debate and discussion at the
                            coming Pan American meeting. I concluded by saying that I would be glad
                            in the meantime to keep in touch with the Ambassador and to exchange any
                            further information with him in regard to all phases of the question. He
                            said that the matter was not of enough importance for extended debate or
                            discussion and he would undertake to see the Ambassador of Venezuela and
                            talk at length with him so as to develop unanimous agreement with
                            respect to the matter. I agree with the Ambassador that all reasonable
                            effort should be made to avoid controversy since this was not a matter
                            of major importance.</p>

                            November 1, the Governing Board of the Pan American Union approved the

                            Mexico, the United States of America, and Venezuela. At the same session
                            it was provided that the seat of the Committee should be in Rio de

                  </p>
                        <p>You may inform the Guatemalan Government that this Government has
                            concluded that the need existed for a patrol of the waters adjacent to
                            the coasts of the United States and accordingly established and at
                            present is maintaining such a patrol. While the decision as to the need
                            for a patrol of the waters adjacent to the coasts of the other American
                            republics is obviously a matter for the determination of the governments
                            of those countries, this Government believes that the institution of a
                            patrol of the waters comprehended within the zone specified in the
                            Declaration of Panama is very desirable, if not essential. If the
                            Government of Guatemala likewise believes in the desirability of such
                            patrol and would welcome the assistance of this Government in order that
                            the patrol might be of a collective nature as contemplated in the
                            paragraph referred to, this Government would be very glad to cooperate
                            with the Government of Guatemala by making available from time to time
                            its vessels and aircraft.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to discuss this situation informally with the
                            appropriate officials of the Guatemalan Government along the lines set
                            forth in the previous paragraph and if the Guatemalan Government is
                            desirous of establishing a collective patrol, it is believed that it
                            would be desirable if arrangements could be concluded to grant a <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0057"/>general authorization for flights
                            by aircraft of this Government over the territory of Guatemala, with any
                            necessary landings at airports, and for entrance into its territorial
                            waters of vessels of the United States Navy in connection with the
                            carrying out of the observation patrols contemplated. You should explain
                            in your conversation that notification will be made to the Government of
                            Guatemala as far in advance as possible, although urgent cases may arise
                            when information regarding the flights or visits can be furnished only
                            after they have taken place. You should emphasize that in any event
                            complete information with regard to the designation of planes, names of
                            vessels and commanding officers, and the location or area to be visited
                            will be furnished as promptly as possible. You should also inform the
                            officials of the Guatemalan Government with whom you discuss this matter
                            that the general authorization requested will be terminated at the
                            earliest possible date. At the same time please endeavor to make it
                            clear that the proposed general authorization for observation flights is
                            not intended to affect in any way the existing blanket arrangement with
                            the Government of Guatemala in accordance with which through flights of
                            service planes over Guatemalan territory to or from the Canal Zone may
                            be made upon notification given through the Legation.</p>
                        <p>You may also inform the officials with whom this matter is taken up that
                            similar agreements have been concluded in principle or are being
                            discussed with the governments of the other Central American countries
                            and certain of the countries in the Caribbean area.</p>
                        <p>If a favorable response is accorded to your oral request, it is believed
                            that it would be desirable to embody the terms and conditions of the
                            understanding in an exchange of informal memoranda with the Ministry for
                            Foreign Affairs. You are requested to inform the Department promptly of
                            the result of your conversation and to forward the texts of any
                            communications exchanged on the subject.</p>
                        <p>For your own information and guidance, in informing the War and Navy
                            Departments of any arrangements for general authorizations for emergency
                            observation patrols which may be concluded, the Department will make it
                            clear that the authorizations are under no circumstances to be used for
                            indiscriminate visits to the countries concerned, and that our missions
                            and local foreign officials will under no circumstances be expected to
                            make arrangements for entertainment of visiting Army and Navy
                            personnel.</p>

                            instruction No. 221, of December 21, 1939,<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">See footnote 2, <ref target="#pg_49">p. 49</ref>.</note> regarding
                            the proposed establishment of a patrol of the waters adjacent to the
                            coasts of the American Republics, I have the honor to report that this
                            matter was taken up orally with the Foreign Minister immediately upon
                            receipt of this instruction, on Thursday, December 28, 1939.</p>
                        <p>After giving Foreign Minister Aguirre an informal outline of the
                            substance of the Department’s instruction, I supplied him with a written
                            memorandum embodying the principal points. The Foreign Minister stated
                            that because of the jurisdiction involved, he felt it <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0059"/>necessary to discuss the matter with the
                            Minister of War, Navy and Aviation, after which he would present it to
                            President Carías for approval.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister again emphasized the sympathetic attitude of his
                            Government towards the objectives of the Declaration of Panama and his
                            desire to afford full cooperation to crystalize the recommendations of
                            the Panama meeting into recognized principles.</p>

                            a full meeting of minds as to the interpretation of the phrase “a

                        <p>You should then explain to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that although

                            any time when on presumptively well-founded possibility the patrol
                            officers believe that such “a positive threat” exists, they will make
                            every endeavor to advise the Department of State and the Legation
                            promptly so that the Government of El Salvador may be <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0061"/>immediately informed. You should

                            regarding the offer of the German Government to sell German boats now in
                            Brazilian ports, I have the honor to report that the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs remarked to me yesterday that if Brazil were not
                            successful in obtaining the boats promised them by the Moore-McCormack
                            Steamship Line, the Brazilian authorities would buy the German boats. I
                            said, “what will the English and French say?” He replied, “Oh, we can
                            arrange that: the British are being excessively polite to us these
                            days.”</p>
                        <p>In that connection, the Director of Exchange of the Bank of Brazil
                            observed this morning that conversations in that regard are going on

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that interest
                            has been evinced by Mr. H. N. Hansard, Administrator of the Naviera
                            Dominicana, C. por A., (Trujillo owned) concerning the possible
                            acquisition of former German vessels which are now in neutral ports in
                            the Netherland West Indies. Mr. Hansard brought up the subject at first
                            as a hypothetical question as to whether there would be any
                            complications if such vessels had been transferred to Netherlands
                            ownership and flag prior to the European war. Nevertheless, in spite of
                            protestations to the effect that Dominican interests would never even
                            consider dealing with Nazi <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0063"/>Germany during times such as the present, it was obvious that what he
                            had in mind were the bargains that could doubtless be obtained if the
                            Naviera Dominicana could, with impunity, purchase German ships which had
                            been rendered useless either by internment in neutral ports or inability
                            to run the blockade. If such acquisitions could be made without
                            complications, however, there is little doubt as to what action the
                            Naviera Dominicana would take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansard finally concluded, or intimated as much to an officer of the
                            Legation, that perhaps the risks involved would not be worth any
                            bargain, no matter how attractive the price.</p>
                        <p>I might add in conclusion that ever since its inception in November 1938
                            the Naviera Dominicana has been trying to build up a Dominican merchant
                            marine by the purchase of old and outmoded or condemned vessels.
                            Immediately after it was organized it acquired the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Presidente Trujillo</hi> of the Dominican Navy at a
                            reputed price of $40,000 which had previously been purchased from the
                            Empresa Naviera de Cuba for $60,000, and in December 1938 it purchased
                            the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Mayan</hi> (American) from Mr. Benitez
                            Rexach, which had until November 1938 been owned by the Grace Line. The
                            price that was supposed to have been paid was $16,000.</p>
                        <p>This in itself would explain the urge for bargains, but added to this is
                            the expectation that, with the elimination of German shipping as a
                            result of the European war and the partial disruption of normal services
                            of the other belligerents, a very favorable opportunity now exists for
                            the new Dominican merchant marine to flourish and grow strong at the
                            expense of others.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that I called on President Cárdenas yesterday afternoon, as I always do
                            prior to even a short visit to the United States.</p>
                        <p>I expressed, as I have done in all my interviews with President Cárdenas,
                            the earnest hope that all pending questions between the two countries
                            could be settled upon an equitable basis. The President said that was
                            his sincere desire and mentioned particularly the waters and petroleum
                                questions.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#pg_667">pp.
                                    667</ref> ff.</note> As to the litter he said he had conferred
                            with Ambassador Castillo Nájera and would do so again before the <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0064"/>Mexican Ambassador returns to
                            Washington the middle of next week and would outline suggestions which
                            he believed would open the way to an agreement. He said they were not
                            yet fully formulated or he would give them to me, but that they would be
                            in shape before Ambassador Castillo Nájera leaves for Washington. He
                            added that I could assure President Roosevelt that Mexico would do
                            everything possible to insure a settlement.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the question of neutrality and he said that Mexico was in
                            full accord with the policy of President Roosevelt and that General
                                Hay<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">Eduardo Hay, Mexican Minister for

                                Panama<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">See <ref target="#pg_15">pp.
                                    15</ref> ff.</note> toward securing effective continental
                            solidarity. I suggested to him, as I had to Ambassador Castillo Nájera
                            earlier in the day, that because the Carranza Government was pro-German
                            in 1916, 1917 and 1918, there was a fear that German influence would be
                            strong in Mexico in this decade. He said: “That was another and distant
                            day. We live in a different period. There should be no fear of German
                            influence or German penetration in Mexico. It is in full accord with the
                            policy of the United States whose friendship it prizes and we will be
                            found standing together to prevent any European country’s penetration or
                            influence in our policies.”</p>
                        <p>Referring to the German ships in Mexican ports (about ten) he said they
                            were kept under observation and their wireless installation had been
                            dismantled. “What will become of these ships?” I asked him. He replied
                            that his government was giving consideration to the question. He said
                            Mexico was negotiating with Germany with a view to having two German
                            tankers turned over in payment of the debt Germany owes Mexico for oil
                            it has delivered. The oil was sold to Germany in a barter agreement, but
                            a large part of the electrical apparatus, steel rails, etc. which
                            Germany was to send to Mexico in payment had not been delivered. If
                            Mexico could get the tankers it would be a good arrangement. As to the
                            other German ships in Mexican waters, the President said he did not
                            think Mexico wished them and he could not say what would happen to them
                            until the Foreign Office had completed its studies. I asked him if he
                            thought any American company would buy and operate them. He said that
                            would depend upon international law and any negotiations they might
                            conclude with the German government. He smiled and asked: “Would they
                            take them with everything on board, including the German crews?” He went
                            on to say that if any American company had a concrete proposal that was
                            deemed workable, of course it would be considered. This was in response
                            to my statement that an American gentleman had suggested that the German
                            ships should be put <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0065"/>into service
                            and he knew Americans who might be glad to purchase them. I asked if
                            this gentleman ought not to take up the matter with Minister
                                Suárez.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Eduardo Suárez, Mexican Minister
                                of Finance.</note> He answered: “Assuredly”.</p>
                        <p>I talked to Minister Suárez and he said he would be glad to see the
                            American gentleman (Mr. Elmer R. Jones, President of Wells Fargo &amp;
                            Company) next week. Mr. Jones thinks a way could be found for the
                            utilization of these German ships. Minister Suárez said it would be
                            necessary to consider the international usage before he could be ready
                            even to do more than discuss any proposal Mr. Jones might make.</p>
                        <p>President Cárdenas asked me if I had heard that France and Germany might
                            ask President Roosevelt to intervene to prevent a long and bloody war.
                            He said that such reports had come to him but without confirmation.</p>

                        <p>280. Finance Minister Suárez advises that Mexico is interested only in
                            purchasing the two German tankers now in its ports by using cash credit
                            which Mexico has in Germany. Suárez said German Embassy in Mexico
                            advised that Germany would fulfill all merchandise contractual
                            obligations against unused Mexican mark credits in Germany by sending
                            merchandise through neutral port to Mexico. German Legation told Suárez
                            that no further mark credits could be opened for account of Mexico.
                            Suárez said equipment and merchandise contracts with Germany call for
                            deliveries at specified intervals and that within two weeks he could
                            tell whether or not Germany could make shipments as specified. Only in
                            case Germany fails to fulfill contracts would Mexico be interested in
                            purchasing German merchant vessels in its ports in order to liquidate
                            credits. Suárez said a legitimate purchase of the merchant vessels would
                            permit Mexico to place them under the Mexican flag without risk of
                            seizure by belligerents. Suárez has made proposition through German
                            Embassy for the two German tankers and is awaiting answer. Suárez stated
                            Davis cash and carry purchase plan was progressing slowly but that
                            processing contract with Eastern States has been increased to 25,000
                            barrels daily with Eastern States acting as sales agent in various
                            European countries. Suárez said he had information that Davis is in
                            Italy and will attempt to enter Germany. Anticipating rayon shortage

                            No. 9178, September 23 reporting that this possibility was discussed by
                            him with President Cárdenas without, however, mentioning names. At the
                            President’s suggestion the interested parties are [to?] take up the
                            matter with Suárez. Jones had to leave for Texas owing to desperate
                            illness of member of his firm but is expected to return here late this
                            week and will call at the Embassy upon his return.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to record below a
                            conversation between the Minister of Finance and the Commercial Attaché
                            on September 25, 1939 in reference to the relation between Mexican
                            unused mark credits in Germany and the German vessels now in Mexican
                            ports. The Commercial Attaché reports as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I asked Minister Suarez the amount of unused mark credits which
                                    his Government now had in Germany. He answered that as far as
                                    the Mexican Government was concerned it amounted to
                                    approximately 3 million dollars. (Mr. W. R. Davis previously
                                    stated that his books showed that the unused Mexican credits in
                                    Germany totalled slightly in excess of 5 million dollars.
                                    Records of Petroleos Mexicanos recorded an unused credit in
                                    Germany of 19,000,000 marks) I asked the Minister if he knew the
                                    total of private commercial credits in Germany held by Mexican
                                    merchants and he replied that he had not made the
                                    calculation.</p>
                                <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0067"/>
                                <p>“I inquired of the Minister what method he intended to employ to
                                    secure the withdrawal of his mark credits from Germany. He
                                    replied that he had received the assurances of the German
                                    Embassy in Mexico that the German Government would fully and
                                    scrupulously fulfil all of its contractual obligations with the
                                    Government of Mexico. I, then, inquired as to how this would be
                                    possible since Germany’s merchant fleet had been practically
                                    cleared from the seas. He answered that the German Embassy in
                                    Mexico had also told him the merchandise ordered by Mexico
                                    against its mark credit would be delivered to a neutral port and
                                    then to Mexico in accordance with stipulations in the various
                                    contracts. I asked the Minister if he believed that this could
                                    be done without serious delays and interruptions to the
                                    transportation of the merchandise in question. He answered that
                                    he could tell within the next ten days or two weeks whether or
                                    not Germany could fulfil its contractual obligations because
                                    certain shipments were due within that period.</p>
                                <p>“In view of the above I inquired of the Minister as to whether or
                                    not he had made any plans for withdrawing his credits from
                                    Germany in case that country could not make shipments of
                                    merchandise. I told him that I asked the question because a
                                    number of people had mentioned to me that Mexico would probably
                                    receive some of the German shipments [<hi rend="italic">ships?</hi>] now in Mexican ports in payment of the
                                    obligations. The Minister replied that he had been negotiating
                                    with the German Government through its Embassy in Mexico City
                                    for the purchase of the two German tankers now in Mexican ports.
                                    He said that he wished to emphasize that aside from the
                                    petroleum mark credit which his Government had in Germany there
                                    was also a cash credit and that he was negotiating for the two
                                    tankers in lieu of the cash credit. In order to clarify this
                                    point I asked him whether or not he would continue to negotiate
                                    for the two tankers even though Germany shipped punctually all
                                    of its merchandise obligations. The Minister reiterated that his
                                    negotiations now in progress for the two tankers were entirely
                                    apart from the petroleum barter credits. He said that he had
                                    already made his propositions to the German Government for the
                                    two tankers and was awaiting an answer. Should Germany fail to
                                    meet its contractual obligations to ship merchandise to Mexico
                                    the Minister stated that he would probably be interested in
                                    taking over sufficient merchantmen to cover the account.</p>
                                <p>“I asked the Minister if he could transfer the registry of any of
                                    the German vessels without running the risk of seizure on the
                                    part of belligerents. He replied that he now believed he could
                                    make a legitimate purchase of the vessels from Germany, fly the
                                    Mexican flag and not encounter any difficulties with the allies.
                                    The Minister then laughed and said that in case a seizure should
                                    take place Germany would be the loser of the vessel because his
                                    purchase contracts would provide for such an eventuality.</p>
                                <p>“In concluding the conversation on this subject, Minister Suarez
                                    stated that the Germany Embassy in Mexico City had advised him
                                    that the German Government would not open any additional
                                    petroleum mark credits.”</p>

                            <p>In the course of my conversation with Licenciado Beteta this morning
                                he said that the Mexican Government has been negotiating with the
                                German Government with a view to purchasing two of the German ships
                                (tankers) now in Mexican harbors since the Mexican Government is
                                badly in need of tankers. The object is to credit them against
                                German indebtedness to Mexico for oil, which amounts to about 18
                                million marks. The German Government has not yet replied. He said
                                that this purchase would be in lieu of taking the German material
                                which was originally proposed in exchange for delivery of oil which
                                occasioned the Mexican credit in Germany. He said that he was
                                acquainted with the suggestion that all German vessels now in
                                Mexican ports might be purchased by American interests, and that he
                                thought this was a very good idea. He said that, although he knew
                                for a certainty that the German ships are now under the control of
                                the German Admiralty, he thought title still rested with the
                                individual German steamship companies, and that he thought Mexico
                                might be able to make some arrangement with Germany for the purchase
                                and eventual transfer to the American interests, retaining that part
                                of the purchase price which would represent the balance of Mexican
                                credits in Germany. He said he supposed it would be necessary to
                                give some assurance that they could not be resold to belligerents. I
                                gathered that his idea was to have the American interests buy only
                                those ships which are not tankers, and that Mexico would keep the
                                two tankers, presumably buying them separately under the
                                negotiations already initiated.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Beteta also said that the Mexican Government had recently
                                purchased two ships in the Scandinavian countries—the <hi rend="italic">Bita</hi>
                                <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0069"/>and the <hi rend="italic">Binta</hi>—both tankers. The Mexican Government had paid
                                something like 103 thousand dollars for one of these, and an amount
                                close to that for the other. Apparently the ships had not as yet
                                been delivered, and he was rather disturbed lest war conditions
                                would obstruct the consummation of the deal, or lest they should
                                fail to reach Mexico.</p>
                            <p>He said that recently Mexico had purchased a tanker from the Cities
                                Service Company in the United States, but that our Maritime
                                Commission had refused to allow the transfer to take place. He
                                understood that this refusal was not directed at the Mexican
                                Government, but was destined to preserve American shipping for
                                American needs.</p>

                        <p>The Counselor of the British Embassy<note n="6" xml:id="d89fn6">V. A. L.
                                Mallet</note> came in this morning by appointment, and said that as
                            the Ambassador was in New York, he had come to convey instructions which
                            had been received from the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet said that the British Government had learned that the
                            Government of Mexico had been giving consideration to the possibility of
                            a transfer of certain German ships, now taking refuge in Mexican ports,
                            to the Mexican flag, and that President Cardenas had had a conversation
                            on the subject with Mr. Daniels. The British Government further learned
                            that on September 24, in the <hi rend="italic">Star and Herald</hi> of
                            Panama City, an article had appeared which described plans for a
                            cooperative arrangement under which claims against Germany held by
                            nationals of the American republics were to be pooled in an organization
                            for the holding of these claims and other debts owed to such nations by
                            the German Government or German nationals, and that as a means of
                            obtaining payment of these claims and debts, the German ships now in the
                            ports of the American states, not including the United States, were to
                            be taken over and operated in the Inter-American trade exclusively under
                            the flags of the different South American republics.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet then stated that on September 17, the British Government had
                            instructed their representatives in all neutral countries, with the
                            exception of the United States, to point out to the Governments to which
                            they were accredited that the British Government would be within their
                            rights in capturing any ship, the flag of which had been transferred
                            from Germany to another country after the outbreak of war. This
                            instruction was not sent to Lord Lothian<note n="7" xml:id="d89fn7">British Ambassador in the United States.</note> because of the <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0070"/>confidence felt by the British
                            Government that the American Government would not lend itself to the
                            carrying out of any such transfers of flag.</p>
                        <p>The Counselor then went on to say that as a result of the information the
                            British Government had received as to the above suggested plans, to
                            which was added the information that the Government of Argentina was
                            very much interested in a similar arrangement, the British Government
                            felt that some move might be undertaken at Panama during the present
                            conference to provide for the transfer of the flags of the German ships
                            now taking refuge in South American ports. The Ambassador, Mr. Mallet
                            said, had been instructed to explain confidentially to this Government
                            the attitude of the British Government toward their right to capture
                            ships transferred from the German flag after the outbreak of war, and to
                            say that this question was vital to the British Government in the
                            prosecution of the war and that they could not entertain any exceptions
                            from the established principles, as any exception would leave the door
                            open to mass transfers of all German ships now sheltering in neutral
                            ports. The British Government thought it best, before any action towards
                            such transfers of flag were taken, to explain its attitude to this
                            Government and to point out that such transfers would leave the way open
                            for the realization of vast sums of foreign exchange by the German
                            Government, as well as the continued operation of their ships in
                            sea-borne commerce with the many attendant advantages resulting to
                            Germany thereby. The British Government had decided that they would find
                            it necessary to proceed to the capture of such ships wherever they were
                            found to be transferred to a foreign flag.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the Ambassador was asked to request this
                            Government to use a restraining influence at Panama if the question of
                            the transfer of flag of these German ships were to become active.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to record below the
                            important details of a conversation between Finance Minister Suarez and
                            Mr. Elmer Jones of Wells Fargo Company on September 28, 1939, as related
                            by Mr. Jones to the Commercial Attaché. The Commercial Attaché reports
                            as follows: <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0071"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. Jones said that he told Minister Suarez that he and other
                                    parties which he represented had an interest in securing the
                                    German vessels now in Mexican ports. He said that he told
                                    Minister Suarez that he was particularly interested in
                                    purchasing the two German tankers, but, would also purchase the
                                    other freight and cargo vessels, excluding the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> if possible, because he felt that the latter
                                    vessel would be a white elephant. Mr. Jones said that he told
                                    the Minister that he knew that the German Government was
                                    indebted to the Mexican Government in excess of five million
                                    dollars and, therefore, the Mexican Government might be
                                    interested in taking over the German vessels in liquidation of
                                    the credits and resell them to him. Mr. Jones told the Minister
                                    that he could arrange to pay for the vessels in materials which
                                    the Mexican Government might desire, or, by full cash payment or
                                    by material and part cash payment.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Jones said that the Minister replied that the German
                                    Government was reluctant to dispose of any of the vessels at
                                    this time and that the German Legation had tried to impress upon
                                    him that the war would be of short duration with Germany as the
                                    victor which would permit Germany to re-enter the Mexican market
                                    within a short time and with much greater force than heretofore.
                                    Mr. Jones said that the Minister also told him that the German
                                    Legation had given him the fullest assurances that all
                                    merchandise against credits established in Germany would be
                                    delivered as specified in the contracts.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Jones said that he asked Minister Suarez if he thought that
                                    Germany could make the deliveries and if he believed that the
                                    war would be of short duration. According to Mr. Jones Minister
                                    Suarez replied that he was not in agreement with the German
                                    Legation on the two points mentioned above because he believed
                                    that the war would be of long duration and, furthermore, he had
                                    his serious doubts as to Germany’s ability to make the
                                    merchandise deliveries. The Minister advised Mr. Jones that he
                                    had made separate overtures to the German Government for the two
                                    tankers and was awaiting a reply. Mr. Jones then asked Minister
                                    Suarez if he would be willing to resell the tankers to him in
                                    case he succeeded in purchasing them. The Minister replied that
                                    the two tankers would be of very great importance to Mexico’s
                                    petroleum industry and that he would not be interested in
                                    reselling the tankers. Mr. Jones then asked Minister Suarez if
                                    the latter would be willing to resell the three tankers which
                                    are now under construction in Italy and the Minister replied in
                                    the negative giving the same reasons as just previously stated,
                                    in the case of the two German tankers.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Jones asked the Minister if Germany did not fulfill its
                                    merchandise deliveries would he be interested in taking over the
                                    German vessels and reselling them to him. He said the Minister
                                    replied to the extent that he would fully cooperate in this
                                    matter.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Jones said that the petroleum question was discussed
                                    casually between himself and Minister Suarez and that during the
                                    conversation Minister Suarez indicated to him that he thought a
                                    man of his type as negotiator would have a good opportunity of
                                    settling the petroleum question.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. Jones said that he discussed with Minister Suarez the
                                    question of the National Railways of Tehuantepec and the latter
                                    requested that Mr. Jones accompany Ulises Irigoyen on an
                                    inspection trip of <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0072"/>the
                                    Tehuantepec Railway. Mr. Jones said that he accepted the
                                    invitation and would leave within the next few days for the
                                    Isthmus.</p>
                                <p>“As a result of his conversation with Minister Suarez, Mr. Jones
                                    said he reached one very definite conclusion. He said he
                                    recalled very distinctly the activities of the German Legation
                                    during the last world war and the success which it had in
                                    convincing the Mexican Government that Germany would be the
                                    victor and return Texas and other portions of the Southern
                                    United States to Mexico. Bearing that in mind Mr. Jones said he
                                    could readily see that the German Legation was now employing the
                                    same tactics with Administration officials, trying to convince
                                    them that the war would be brief with Germany as the victor. Mr.
                                    Jones said that he had no evidence or intimation that Germany
                                    had made any promises to Mexico and that, furthermore, contrary
                                    to the Carranza Administration he believed that the present
                                    activities of the German Legation would fall upon deaf ears in
                                    most cases. Mr. Jones said an instance of this was the statement
                                    of Minister Suarez that he did not agree with the German
                                    Legation that the war would be brief and that Germany could make
                                    the merchandise deliveries. Mr. Jones said that he told Minister
                                    Suarez that if the United States was compelled to enter the
                                    present war Mexico could probably not avoid doing the same thing
                                    and he said that Mr. Suarez agreed with him.</p>
                                <p>“As a matter of explanation Mr. Jones told me that he had
                                    discussed the purchase of the German ships with Mr. Thomas W.
                                    Lamont before leaving New York and that Mr. Lamont had shown
                                    considerable interest. Mr. Jones said that when he arrived in
                                    Havana and was on his way to Mexico, he received a telegram from
                                    Mr. Lamont stating that he had discussed this matter with
                                    officials of the State Department and that they had displayed
                                    some interest. In other words, Mr. Jones seems to be
                                    representing himself and Mr. Thomas W. Lamont in his
                                    conversation with Minister Suarez.”</p>

                        <p>The Counselor of the British Embassy came in to see me today, at my
                            request. Mr. Dunn and I stated that we had been turning over in our
                            minds the suggestion made by Mr. Mallet in his recent conversation with
                            Mr. Dunn. That suggestion, we reminded him, contemplated that we use our
                            influence at Panama to restrain movements which might be going forward
                            there under which Latin American governments, in whose harbors German
                            ships were blockaded, should take over those ships.</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0073"/>
                        <p>I pointed out that the only discussions we knew of were bilateral,
                            proceeding between the German government and the governments of the
                            countries involved. If we were concerned at all, it could only be as a
                            result of some cooperative arrangement between the Latin American
                            governments. I pointed out that we expected the Neutrality Act to pass
                            in a form which released ample American shipping to take care of the
                            inter-American trade, so that these ships would not be needed for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I said, it was entirely conceivable that the effect of
                            continued submarine warfare might result in a shortage of ships in the
                            Atlantic trade. In such case, neutrals would naturally wish to have
                            ships available for their needs. This would, presumably, be greatest on
                            the trans-Atlantic runs. In such case we here were exploring the
                            possibilities of a take-over of these ships, possibly by expropriation
                            under an arrangement by which the price of the ships would be held in
                            escrow for Germany or for their owners, to be paid at the close of the
                            war. It was generally agreed, I said, that operation of these ships by
                            German crews and German agents would not be desirable; the actual
                            tonnage, however, under some such arrangement as that under exploration,
                            would become available to keep the commerce lanes open.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet indicated that their principal preoccupation was the fear lest
                            the German government, through sale of these ships, acquire credits here
                            which they might use. He suggested that he would put the matter up to
                            London. I pointed out that this was merely tentative and unofficial;
                            that we were exploring the possibilities of the situation, rather than
                            suggesting a definite plan, but that the attitude of the British
                            government would be of interest. Mr. Mallet agreed that he fully
                            understood this and would endeavor to find out what views his government
                            might have in the premises.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador<note n="7a" xml:id="d92fn7a">Count de
                                Saint-Quentin.</note> called to see me today, at his own request. He
                            referred to the ships blockaded in Latin American harbors and to the
                            suggestion that the governments of these countries purchase these ships
                            from Germany. He pointed out that his government took the same position
                            as the British government, namely, that they would not recognize any
                            such transfers and that such ships would accordingly be liable to
                            capture as prize if they reached the high seas.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0074"/>
                        <p>I stated that we had had a similar indication of attitude from the
                            British government. Further, I said, we had asked the British Embassy to
                            indicate their attitude towards an idea we were exploring, namely, that
                            these ships might after a period of time be expropriated; the payment
                            for them be held in escrow until the end of the war, in which case the
                            ships might be used in the trans-Atlantic trade. I pointed out that we
                            would not consider it satisfactory to have these ships operated by
                            German crews or German agencies but that the transfer would have to be
                            bona fide.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador pointed out that certain large French ships, including the
                                <hi rend="italic">Normandie</hi>, were taking indefinite refuge in
                            American ports and he wondered whether the procedure of expropriation
                            might be applied to them. In this connection he recalled, rather
                            unhappily, that Secretary Morgenthau<note n="8" xml:id="d92fn8">Henry
                                Morgenthau, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury.</note> had requested him
                            and Lord Lothian to meet him at the Treasury and had there proposed that
                            the British and French Governments sell the <hi rend="italic">Queen
                                Mary</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Normandie</hi> respectively, to
                            the United States Government. On inquiry it developed that the price was
                            to be credited on the French and British war debts. He and Lothian had
                            thereafter conferred. He had, he said, presented the matter to his
                            government in the kindliest light possible, namely, that the hope was to
                            get a token payment on the French war debts in order to assist in
                            passing the Neutrality Act<note n="9" xml:id="d92fn9">See section
                                entitled “Revision of United States Neutrality Legislation,” <ref target="frus1939v01#pg_656">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>,
                                    pp. 656</ref> ff. The Neutrality Act was approved November 4,
                                1939; 54 Stat. 4.</note> here; but he was not altogether clear
                            whether this was the real motive. However, he said, on endeavoring to
                            discuss it with Mr. Hull shortly thereafter, Mr. Hull had stopped him by
                            saying that the proposal had been entirely dropped, at the President’s
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>I said at once that I did not think anyone had even remotely considered
                            any idea of that kind. Our concern, rather, was that as and when
                            Atlantic shipping became necessary, the Latin American countries which
                            depended on such shipping might find it possible to use that shipping. I
                            said that I thought it not unlikely that prior to expropriation some
                            procedure would be adopted by which the owners of the vessels might be
                            asked to take the vessels out, failing which they might be expropriated.
                            I also pointed out that our cables from Panama indicated that certain
                            Latin American governments desired to purchase the German merchant
                            ships. M. de Saint-Quentin observed that they had no particular
                            objection to these ships being purchased, but that they feared lest the
                            price of these ships would become credits for the German government
                            which it could use abroad; and consequently they objected. I said that
                            if the idea we were exploring were carried into effect, this would not
                            be a difficulty, because the price would be held in trust until the end
                            of the war. In any case, <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0075"/>the
                            matter was not immediate, but merely an attempt to consider
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p>We talked briefly as to the progress of the war; the Ambassador
                            considered that Mr. Hitler’s speech would probably be an offer of peace,
                            including the establishment of a buffer Polish state and possibly
                            Bohemia, accompanied by threats to wipe out London and Paris through air
                            bombs. A Poland so constituted, he stated, would be meaningless, because
                            it could be seized at any time. If it were thought that a threat of
                            wiping out London or Paris would frighten anyone, the Germans would be
                            surprised, since both populations were thoroughly prepared in their
                            minds for that eventuality.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador telephoned me this morning. He said he had gathered
                            from our conversation that action by the Panama Conference regarding the
                            transfer of blockaded German ships to inter-American governments had not
                            taken place. Yet in this morning’s paper he had observed that a
                            resolution on the subject was passed.</p>
                        <p>I called to his attention the fact that while I had made no mention of
                            any possible action by the Panama Conference regarding these ships, I
                            had indicated to him that certain Latin American governments were
                            pressing the problem of transfer of these ships to their <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0076"/>flags. The final resolutions of the
                            Panama Conference had not as yet reached us and I would have to withhold
                            any comment until we had the texts of the resolutions passed.</p>

                            with Assistant Secretary Berle the French Ambassador indicated that his
                            Government took the same position as the British Government on the
                            purchase and transfer of German ships now in the harbors of the other
                            American republics. The Ambassador was then informed, as the British
                            Ambassador had already been on October 2, that in order to make these
                            ships available probably for use in trans-Atlantic trade we were
                            continuing to explore the matter with particular reference to the
                            possible needs of the neutral nations of this hemisphere. The
                            possibility that payments for transferred ships might be held in escrow
                            until the end of the war was mentioned to the Ambassador, as was also
                            the opinion that any of the transfers which were already desired by
                            several of the other American republics should be entirely bona fide and
                            the ships not operated by German crews or agencies.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador indicated, as had the British Ambassador on
                            September 29, that the objection to transfer of title of the ships was
                            not chiefly their purchase by American neutrals but fear lest the
                            payments would become credits usable abroad by the German
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>A telegram of October 3, 5 p.m., from the Embassy in Mexico reports that
                            the French Chargé expects today to deliver to the Mexican Government the
                            information that his Government associates itself with the British
                            Government in being “unalterably opposed” to any kind of transfer and
                            would continue to consider any transferred German ships as belligerent
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p>Shipping interests in the United States continue to be disturbed at the
                            possibility that use might be made of transferred German ships and are
                            inquiring as to any contemplated movements in this direction. Your radio

                        <p>296. My 293, October 3, 5 p.m. The French Chargé has just informed me
                            that he is going to communicate further with his Government before
                            carrying out the instructions mentioned in my 293. His motives are (1)
                            that he believes that opposition to the transfer to the Mexican flag of
                            the two German tankers in Mexican ports would be taken amiss by the
                            Mexican Government and (2) that it may not be to the interest of the
                            French and British to endeavor to prevent a transfer of the other German
                            ships in Mexican ports to American interests. He had learned that the
                            possibility of transfer of some of these ships to Americans was
                            mentioned in a conversation between the Ambassador and President
                            Cardenas.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador came in at his own request. He said that he
                            desired to make some further reference to the proposed safety zone
                            around this hemisphere; that this would include the problem of how
                            German merchant vessels, some eighty in number, now in American harbors,
                            would be dealt with; that his Government would be averse to the sale of
                            these vessels, for the reason, among others, that it would give the
                            German Government a large amount of exchange to use abroad for all sorts
                            of undesirable purposes. He then raised the question of transfer under
                            legal requirements and asked whether it could be made legally. I did not
                            go into details on this matter but threw out the tentative comment,
                            which I described as tentative, to the effect that there would be
                            serious difficulties in any event in carrying through a <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0078"/>completed legal transaction for the sale
                            and transfer of these German vessels to other governments or
                            individuals, and especially governments. I indicated to him that I would
                            take the matter up further and acquaint him with any final impressions I
                            might have. He then said that the effect of any policy of taking over
                            these vessels in Pan American ports would be bad on other neutrals in
                            whose ports German vessels in large numbers are now anchored, such as in
                            the case of Holland. Germany, he said, could easily put pressure on
                            Holland to do her wishes if such a policy of transfer should be adopted
                            in Pan America. I stated to the Ambassador, in reply to a general remark
                            of his, that there were no particularly new developments in the scope
                            and nature of the proposed safety zone more than I had set forth in our
                            previous conversation. I then repeated the substance of what I had said
                            to the press within the last two days on this subject.</p>

                            distinctive signs of warships”.</p>
                        <p>This provision which was initiated by the Argentine representatives was
                            intended to take care primarily of those republics which have extensive
                            coast lines and which either now have or may have in their several ports
                            German merchant vessels which have taken refuge and where the local
                            police or naval authorities may not be sufficiently strong or numerous
                            to cope with particular situations which may arise. The basic idea was
                            to concentrate all such merchant vessels in a selected port where
                            presumably the naval or police authorities would be sufficiently ample
                            to take care of any emergency situation.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the carrying out of such a provision in the cases
                            mentioned would make it easier for the American Governments to maintain
                            strict vigilance and supervision and to prevent the sudden egress of
                            German merchant vessels for offensive purposes.</p>
                        <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0079"/>
                        <p>As indicated in an earlier telegram I think it is probable that certain
                            of the American Governments will take steps in this direction in the
                            near future as a measure of self protection. Immediately after my return
                            I will discuss with the President, the Department and the Navy
                            Department the impressions I have obtained as to the desire and
                            intentions of several of the American Governments with regard to the
                            problem with which they are all confronted in connection with a
                            relatively large number of German vessels which have taken refuge in
                            their ports. I would recommend as a matter of expedience as well as of
                            ultimate advantage that it be suggested to the British and French
                            Governments that they should not undertake to crystallize their
                            positions with regard to this problem until our own Government in
                            particular has been afforded ample opportunity of discussing the whole
                            situation with them and of giving full consideration to every factor in
                            the problem. There are many possible ways in which the question could be
                            handled and developed some of which would clearly have advantages in
                            many directions but further discussion and interchange would be
                            necessary before they could be defined.</p>
                        <p>It would be very difficult to set forth clearly by telegram the multitude
                            of impressions which we have all of us obtained from our conversations
                            with the representatives of the other American Republics in regard to
                            this question. I am optimistic enough to believe that it can be worked
                            out satisfactorily but I recognize that many exceedingly powerful
                            interests are involved and considerable time and study would have to be
                            given to it.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the penultimate paragraph of the Department’s telegram
                            the statement in my radio address of October 3 was merely a reference to
                            a provision in the general declaration of neutrality which is of course
                            applicable only in the light of certain clearly specified contingencies.
                            There was no indication in my speech that such transfer of the flag is
                            immediately likely although I am advised that the Mexican Government has
                            transfer under very urgent consideration as a means of offsetting debts
                            held by them in the form of frozen marks.</p>

                        <p>The Counselor of the Argentine Embassy<note n="15" xml:id="d99fn15">Ricardo Bunge.</note> came in to see me today, at his request. He
                            stated that his government had received a notice from the British
                            government that transfer of German ships blockaded <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0080"/>in Argentine harbors to the Argentine
                            flag would not be recognized by the government of Great Britain. He
                            indicated that the principal reason given was the fear lest the German
                            government thereby be placed in funds in the Argentine. He asked what
                            attitude we were taking.</p>
                        <p>I immediately showed him the memorandum of conversation between Mr.
                            Mallet, Mr. Dunn and myself, dated October 2, 1939, relating to the
                            British suggestion that we use our influence to restrain such transfers.
                            I directed his attention particularly to the fact that I had pointed out
                            to Mr. Mallet that the matter was primarily a matter between the British
                            government and the governments of the countries involved; that if we had
                            any right to make representations it could only arise as a result of a
                            cooperative arrangement between the American governments. I added,
                            however, that the matter had been the subject of some discussion at
                            Panama; and that we might contemplate at least the possibility that a
                            solidary and uniform attitude in these matters might be reached by all
                            of us. I added that I understood the representations made by the British
                            to the Argentine government were in line with those which had been made
                            in Mexico; and that the French government had associated itself with
                            these proposals.</p>
                        <p>I also invited attention to the suggestion which we were exploring,
                            namely, that the British might possibly see their way clear to
                            recognizing such transfers, provided the price of these vessels was held
                            in escrow until the end of the war.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bunge expressed appreciation. He said that he was informed from
                            Buenos Aires that a law had been passed here supposedly under date of
                            August, 1914, under and by which we arranged for the taking over of
                            ships blockaded here and their transfer to our own flag. I said that I
                            had no knowledge of such a law and that I thought that there might have
                            been confusion with a part of our war legislation which did permit us to
                            take over ships both building and actually in port; but that I would
                            look the matter up and inform him of the state of our legislation in
                            that regard.</p>
                        <p>He likewise adverted to the article in the <hi rend="italic">American
                                Journal of International Law</hi>, which includes a projected
                            statement of neutral rights.<note n="16" xml:id="d99fn16">See Editorial
                                Comment, <hi rend="italic">American Journal of International

                                195.</note> In this is found a statement that any transfer from a
                            belligerent flag to a neutral flag in time of war is presumed to be in
                            bad faith unless the government to whose flag the ship is transferred
                            can prove the contrary. This, he thought, was contrary to the settled
                            rule of international law.</p>
                        <p>I confined myself to commenting that this rule had been widely insisted
                            on by the British during the previous war and since they were actually a
                            great naval power, I presumed that they would continue to insist on
                            it.</p>
                        <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0081"/>
                        <p>Dr. Bunge concluded by asking whether I could make up a little
                            bibliography of the American text writing and opinion relating to the
                            transfer of belligerent ships to neutral flags, which he might send to
                            his government. I told him I would be very happy to ask the Legal
                            Adviser’s office if they would make up such a list, which I should be
                            glad to send him.<note n="17" xml:id="d99fn17">This list was handed to
                                the Counselor of the Argentine Embassy by Assistant Secretary Berle
                                on October 12 (800.852/207a).</note> I gathered that he wished
                            merely a list of the outstanding articles, books or statements, if any,
                            which had appeared on the point.</p>

                                the Division of the American Republics.</note> The Chargé d’Affaires
                            at Mexico City reports that the French Chargé states privately that he
                            is going to communicate further with his Government before carrying out
                            the instructions to inform the Mexican Government of the unalterable
                            opposition of his Government to the transfer of German vessels to
                            neutrals, because (1) he believes that opposition to the transfer to the
                            Mexican flag of the two German tankers in Mexican ports would be taken
                            amiss by the Mexican Government and (2) it may not be to the interest of
                            the French and British to endeavor to prevent a transfer of the other
                            German ships in Mexican ports to American interests. (The Chargé may
                            have received new instructions from his Government after the
                            desirability was pointed out to the French Ambassador here of very
                            careful consideration of this matter before reaching a fixed
                            decision.)</p>
                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires at Mexico City also reports that the Chilean
                            Embassy there has received instructions from the Chilean Government to
                            seek full particulars regarding the capacity, tonnage, et cetera, of
                            German tankers in Mexican harbors, and he suggests that some offer for
                            the use or acquisition of these tankers may have been made by the German
                            Government to the Chilean Government.</p>

                            by Vice President Rihl called at the Department yesterday to discuss
                            Panair’s situation in Colombia. They agreed to do everything possible to

                            arriving about October 15. They were told that it seemed preferable to
                            dispense with Von Bauer’s services in the new organization and that the
                            de-Germanizing of SCADTA should be continued. I believe Rihl <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0082"/>will do his best to clarify the
                            situation, but that he may be reluctant to dispense with Von Bauer’s

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Legation’s despatch no. 901 of September 19, 1939 and to report further
                            developments regarding the interest of the Compañía Naviera Dominicana,
                            C. por A., in acquiring German vessels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. H. N. Hansard, the administrator of the Trujillo owned company, again
                            brought the subject up in a conversation with an officer of the Legation
                            and stated that it had been determined that the vessel under
                            consideration was one of the Horn Line ships now in Curacao. It was
                            intimated that the bill of sale had already been drawn up before it was
                            discovered definitely that the ship was German. Hansard made a point of
                            stating that as soon as he learned that the ship was German he wished to
                            drop the matter completely and consequently he was looking for an excuse
                            to do so, implying that he had reluctantly pursued the matter thus far
                            under orders from his chief.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, interest is still evinced in the possibility of acquiring a
                            German vessel at a bargain and evidently the subject was brought up in
                            order to sound out the attitude which the Legation might take in the
                            event that the purchase were effected and also as a possible means of
                            settling in their own minds whether or not they could take <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0083"/>advantage of this opportunity within the
                            scope of the arrangements made at Panamá on this subject.</p>
                        <p>It may be added in conclusion that this might have been one of the

                            the two German tankers now in Mexican ports the German Legation told him
                            that its answer to his proposal would be delayed until the outcome of
                            Hitler’s peace proposals became evident. …</p>

                        <p>307. My telegram No. 296, October 4, 6 p.m. The French Chargé d’Affaires
                            yesterday received from his Government instructions regarding the
                            question of transfer of belligerent vessels which he says leaves him
                            ample latitude to deal cautiously with the matter in talking with
                            members of the Mexican Government. He says that he saw Beteta this
                            morning and explained to him that any transfer of German vessels to
                            Mexican registry might raise certain problems for the British and French
                            Governments. Beteta replied that he was aware of this; that the Mexican
                            Government was anxious to acquire these vessels (two tankers) and that
                            when they found a way of doing so he would consult with the French
                            Chargé d’Affaires regarding the method in order to obtain the
                            concurrence therein of the British and French Governments.</p>
                        <p>I also saw Beteta today and in the course of the conversation he told me
                            that while the Mexican Government was taking every precaution regarding
                            belligerent activities in Mexico they realize that as a Government they
                            might not always have full information regarding what was going on. Any
                            information which might reach our Embassy <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0084"/>even if it were only a rumor regarding unneutral
                            activities would be of interest to him as it would give him an
                            opportunity to check up to ascertain the facts.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate telegraphic instructions as to whether it is desired
                            that any of the information now currently reaching the Embassy should be
                            communicated to Beteta. I believe it would be best except in cases of
                            extreme urgency if it is desired that anything should be communicated
                            that this should be done only after it has been coordinated in
                            Washington with information from other sources. Thus the Department
                            could telegraph Embassy what it wished to have communicated to Beteta as
                            information is received from all sources and coordinated.</p>

                        <p>329. Refer Embassy’s telegram 280, September 26, 5 p.m. Suarez said that
                            Germany so far was delivering merchandise according to asserted
                            agreements and that until a default occurred he could not take any
                            measures to seize German ships. He said that Germany is delivering the
                            merchandise to Mexican Consulates in neutral ports mentioning
                            particularly Rotterdam. He said that such procedure placed the
                            merchandise under Mexican ownership before its departure from neutral
                            ports. Suarez said Germans had notified him that they were ready to
                            deliver to Rotterdam 1,000 tons cast-iron pipe; 200 tons steel pipe; two
                            suction dredges; one turbine and one mariposa valve. Structural bridge
                            steel at Vigo, Spain being transferred to Italian vessel for Mexican
                            delivery. Remainder of structural steel is to be delivered to Holland
                            for transshipment to Mexico.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador, Count de Saint-Quentin, called to see me today, at
                            his own request.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had merely come to inquire whether anything further had
                            happened in regard to the proposed transfer of German ships blockaded in
                            Latin American harbors to the neutral flags of the countries in which
                            they were blockaded.</p>
                        <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>I said that so far as I knew there had been no change in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, though certain governments had
                            continued to discuss the matter among themselves and had been good
                            enough to keep us informed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had naturally sent along to Paris our
                            suggestion that we consider the possibility of transfer of these vessels
                            to neutral flags, payment being held in escrow until the end of the war,
                            for study, but had no reply as yet.</p>
                        <p>I said that we had not felt under any great pressure of time in that
                            regard; and I reminded him that at the time the suggestion was made it
                            was in view of the possibility that shipping losses might be so great as
                            to result in a shortage of bottoms for the Atlantic Trade. I had
                            gathered that no government desired to precipitate action in this
                            regard. I said, however, that in the event that further proposals by
                            Latin American governments to acquire blockaded shipping were presented
                            to us, I should be glad to try to keep him generally informed. We had
                            repeated to the governments which had discussed the matter with us the
                            substance of the French and British objection to the transfer; and it
                            was our general view that if anything were worked out it would come
                            better as a matter of general agreement. For the present, however, there
                            was no change in the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether there would not be a competent group to
                            determine it and whether the proposed Committee of Seven emerging from
                            the Panama Conference would not be an appropriate body. I said I thought
                            that this very likely was so.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Truelle<note n="25" xml:id="d106fn25">Jacques Truelle, French
                                Minister, and Counselor of Embassy.</note> of the French Embassy
                            spoke to me yesterday in your absence from your office. He said that his
                            Government had information to the effect that Mexico was about to
                            acquire from Germany all of the German vessels now in Mexican waters
                            with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> as an offset
                            to the five million marks credit established in Germany by Mexico in
                            connection with oil shipments. Mr. Truelle did not seem to know whether
                            the marks in question were of the gold or some other variety.</p>
                        <p>I gave him some general information such as might be available to anyone
                            who has carefully followed the Mexican and American press, and in reply
                            to his specific inquiry as to whether we knew of the conclusion of any
                            deal between the Mexican and German governments <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0086"/>respecting some or all of the vessels in
                            question, I said that so far as I knew no definite arrangements had been
                            made.</p>
                        <p>He said he would appreciate being informed should we learn of the
                            conclusion of any arrangement of this character.</p>
                        <p>The last information I have indicated that the British and French
                            governments had not been receptive to any ideas of acquisition by Mexico
                            or other American republics of German vessels, and I would therefore
                            appreciate instructions as to whether, in the event we receive
                            information of the reaching of an agreement between Germany and Mexico
                            in this matter, I should inform Mr. Truelle.</p>

                            Vallance. Mr. McDonald said that he represented interests in New York
                            who wish to buy the German ships interned in Latin American ports. He
                            had approached the German Embassy and had been given encouragement. He
                            had attempted to see Sir Owen Chalkley<note n="28" xml:id="d107fn28">Commercial Counselor of Embassy.</note> at the British Embassy but
                            it was intimated that he could not discuss matters of this kind with any
                            one in authority unless he were introduced through officials in the
                            Department of State. He asked me if I could arrange for an appointment
                            for him. He said the purpose of the purchase was to put the ships into
                            the trans-Atlantic trade for carrying cargo to the British and French
                            and that the ships would be registered under the Panama flag. I told him
                            that I would give thought to the matter and let him know.</p>

                        <p>Mr. William K. Jackson,<note n="31" xml:id="d108fn31">Vice president of
                                the United Fruit Company.</note> together with the Washington
                            representative of the United Fruit Company, came in to see me yesterday,
                            at Mr. Jackson’s request. He wished the assistance of the Department in
                            the following manner:</p>
                        <p>The United Fruit Company owns the Unida Company, a German corporation.
                            This subsidiary owns a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Wesermunde</hi>,
                            which is under the German flag and is now blockaded in Curaçao. United
                            Fruit wishes to transfer this to the Honduran flag; says it has the
                            consent of the German government; wishes to have the transfer recognized
                            by the British government, and wants our assistance.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I did not see that we could intervene in the matter. The
                            ship had never been American and was not coming to American registry.
                            While it was true that we had at various times endeavored to give
                            assistance on the basis of mere ownership of stock, I thought it unwise,
                            in a single situation, to set up the precedent that the Government would
                            intervene with one belligerent to secure recognition of transfer from an
                            opposing belligerent to a neutral flag.</p>
                        <p>I added that I thought it not impossible that the problem of all of the
                            German blockaded ships and their transfer might come up eventually;
                            further, I noted the British objection to any transaction which might
                            make foreign exchange available to the Germans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jackson said that since this was a mere book transfer, with no money
                            coming to the Germans, he thought everything was all right. I said that
                            in that case his assurances to the British probably would be more
                            persuasive than ours, since it was obviously impossible for us to check
                            through the very long ramifications of the United Fruit Company
                            financing and thus be able to give our assurance to the British that the
                            Germans would not be advantaged by the transfer.</p>
                        <p>I added that of course we had not any objection to the Company’s making
                            any representation to the British Embassy which it cared to do.</p>
                        <p>The United Fruit Company was not particularly happy about this, but they
                            accepted the situation. I should be inclined to think that they may ask
                            further consideration of the matter.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Apropos of the reports in the press
                            concerning the prospective purchase by the Chilean Government of some
                            German ships now in Chilean ports, I have the honor to report that Mr.
                                Frost<note n="32" xml:id="d109fn32">Wesley Frost, Counselor of
                                Embassy.</note> has discussed the matter with Under Secretary of
                            Commerce Señor Cayetano Vigar, who admits that the Chilean Government,
                            soon after the beginning of the war, suggested to the German Government
                            its desire to purchase these ships. It appears that Señor Vigar, under
                            whose jurisdiction the maritime section of the Foreign Office falls (the
                            Chilean Maritime Commission), is in active charge; though he was vague
                            as to where the plan initiated.</p>
                        <p>He reports that the German Government has been most unresponsive and up
                            to the present moment appears to be entirely indifferent, and that there
                            have been no new developments to indicate that the proposal is receiving
                            serious consideration by the Germans. He went so far as to speculate on
                            what Germany’s ultimate aims may be which may explain Germany’s apparent
                            indifference, and mentioned the possibility that the German merchant
                            fleet may be given Russian registry.</p>
                        <p>It appears that but three of the six German ships in Chilean ports were
                            of interest to the Chilean navigation companies, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurt</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Dusseldorf</hi>,
                            and the <hi rend="italic">Dresden;</hi> the others being too large (such
                            as the <hi rend="italic">Osorno</hi>) or too small (such as the <hi rend="italic">Priwall</hi>). The <hi rend="italic">Dresden</hi> has
                            now left Chilean waters presumably on its way to Vladivostok. Señor
                            Vigar has the idea that the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurt</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dusseldorf</hi> might be worth something like 100,000
                            pounds sterling each. If Germany will sell, he thought the funds could
                            be secured partly by the Corporation of Fomento, partly by the Ministry
                            of Fomento, and partly through loans floated by the already water-logged
                            Junta de Exportación Agrícola. Marks are gradually becoming available in
                            moderate quantities from the non-arrival of goods ordered in
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, however, it seems that at present nothing in the way of a sale
                            is in prospect, despite the press reports.</p>

                        <p>10. According to the British Consul who arrived yesterday from Curaçao
                            Macauley of the New Orleans office of the United Fruit Company is now at
                            Curaçao arranging to transfer their vessel, the German steamship <hi rend="italic">Wesermunde</hi>, to the Panamanian flag.</p>
                        <p>He said the steamer <hi rend="italic">Macabi</hi>, Panamanian flag,
                            owners United Fruit Company, proceeded from Aruba to Curaçao loading
                            cargo from German vessels. This consisted of German shipments of pipe,
                            et cetera, belonging to United Fruit Company and some materials for the
                            construction of the Casa Presidencial at San José, Costa Rica. British
                            authorities did not raise any objection to these transshipments.</p>

                            from this office dated October 6, 1939, entitled “Method of Transferring

                            registered with the Brazilian authorities as the active partner of a
                            firm organized under Article 231 of Decree No. 220–A of July 3, 1935.
                            This man is said to have provided 10 contos of the capital for the new
                            firm, while 1,000 contos was obtained from the Rio de Janeiro branch of
                            the Hamburg–South American Line, acting as the inactive partner. The new
                            firm has applied to the Maritime Administrative Tribunal for permission
                            to effect the registry under the Brazilian flag of certain ships
                            belonging to it, and it is understood that this permission will probably
                            be refused.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted that three of the four German ships now at this port (the
                                <hi rend="italic">Santos, La Coruña</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bahia

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that I was
                            informed today by Mr. Harold Darlington, British Vice Consul in
                            Tegucigalpa, that it has been reliably reported the German freighter <hi rend="italic">Wesermunde</hi>, at present at Curaçao, West Indies,
                            is negotiating for a change of registry to the Honduran flag. The new
                            name this vessel will take is <hi rend="italic">Chirropo</hi>, according
                            to this report.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the effort to change to Honduran registry at this
                            time is motivated by the fact that the ship is now in a port controlled
                            by the Dutch and that this step is being taken as protection for the
                            German owners in the event the Netherlands break relations with
                            Germany.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Embassy’s despatch
                            No. 139 of November 8th last, I have the honor to report that newspaper
                            articles apparently based on statements secured at the Foreign Office
                            have now appeared to the effect that Chilean negotiations for the
                            acquisition of the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Frankfurt</hi> and the S. S.
                                <hi rend="italic">Dusseldorf</hi> reached a stalemate on the 24th
                            instant. The German Ambassador, accompanied by his counselor, conferred
                            extensively with the Minister for Foreign Affiairs and the Under
                            Secretary of Commerce on that day; and the state[ment] was thereupon
                            published that the negotiations had been terminated because of
                            disagreement as to prices. It was intimated that the Chilean Government
                            has not abandoned its intention of acquiring additional ships for the
                            expansion of its merchant marine, and might undertake negotiations with
                            other countries. The Under Secretary of Commerce had discussed the
                            matter informally with a member of my staff a day or two earlier, and
                            indicated the possibility that the purchase of American merchant ships
                            might be considered if the prices should not prove <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0091"/>to be too high. He mentioned that ships
                            not to exceed 7,000 gross tons would be desired, and that refrigeration
                            facilities would be a consideration. In a subsequent press interview,
                            however, Señor Vigar has stated that the war dangers to navigation in
                            Europe are driving abundant tonnage into the South American trade, so
                            that Chile will not need to concern herself as to purchasing merchant
                            ships. Conceivably the Chilean attitude may be based on the thought that
                            the German prices on the two vessels in question may yet be brought to a
                            level which would permit a transaction.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to record below a
                            conversation between Finance Minister Suarez and the Commercial Attaché
                            on November 27, 1939. The Commercial Attaché reports as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I asked Minister Suarez when he expected to receive his three
                                    tankers from Italy and the two tankers from Norway. Minister
                                    Suarez answered that he had just sent a man to Italy for the
                                    purpose of making arrangements to receive the first tanker in
                                    January, the second in February and the third in March. He said
                                    that the three tankers had a capacity of 12,000 tons each. In
                                    regard to the Norwegian tankers, Minister Suarez said that they
                                    would arrive in December or January and also had a capacity of
                                    12,000 tons each. Without any questioning the Minister said that
                                    he would soon own the German tanker <hi rend="italic">Tine
                                        Amussen</hi> now at Puerto Mexico. I asked him if the German
                                    Government had agreed to make the sale and he replied that it
                                    had and that its consummation only depended upon an agreement in
                                    price. The Minister stated that he had offered the German
                                    Government 250,000.00 dollars whereas the seller was requesting
                                    Dlls. 350,000.00. Minister Suarez stated that the Mexican
                                    Government would pay more than it had offered and that in view
                                    of the reduction of duties on petroleum in the Venezuelan
                                    treaty, he would telephone Mr. Silva Herzog to make the purchase
                                    as soon as possible. Minister Suarez laughed when he said that
                                    he would have the American Navy to protect his German tanker
                                    plying between Mexican and American Gulf ports. The Minister
                                    said that it would be necessary to pay cash in dollars for the
                                    tanker.</p>
                                <p>“In speaking of petroleum deliveries to the United States he said
                                    that the petroleum and its derivatives now at Eastern States or
                                    stored in the United States would have to be re-exported and
                                    sold to other countries. He said, however, that if conditions
                                    continued as they are he would find it necessary to ship
                                    petroleum to the United States, pay the regular import duty and
                                    sell it upon the American market.”</p>

                            Director of Exchange of the Bank of Brazil informs me that Major
                            Napoleão Alencastro Guimarães, Chefe do Gabinete of the Ministerio da
                            Viação e Communicações, is interested in purchasing German freight ships
                            now tied up in Brazilian and other South American ports. The Director
                            feels that the Brazilian Government will not sanction the transaction
                            owing to the possibility of future complications with the British and
                            French Admiralties.</p>

                        <p>1936. Strictly personal for the President and the Secretary. Churchill
                            sent for me this morning and following our talk sent me the following
                            communication: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“My Dear Ambassador. The inclosures cover our conversation this

                        <p>I am sending memorandum enclosed with Churchill’s note.</p>
                        <p>The following from Naval Person:<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Code words
                                used for Winston S. Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty.</note>

                                <p>[“] We quite understand natural desire of United States to keep
                                    belligerents out of their waters. We like the idea of a wide
                                    limit of say 300 miles within which no submarines of any
                                    belligerent country should act. If America requests all
                                    belligerents to comply, we should immediately declare that we
                                    would respect your wishes. General questions of international
                                    law would of course remain unprejudiced. More difficulty arises
                                    about surface ships, because if a raider operates from or takes
                                    refuge in the American zone, we should have to be protected or
                                    allowed to protect ourselves. We have mentioned several other
                                    instances to Mr. Kennedy. We do not mind how far south the
                                    prohibited zone goes, provided that it is effectively
                                    maintained. We should have great difficulty in accepting a zone
                                    which was only policed by some weak neutral. But of course if
                                    the American Navy takes care of it, that is all right.</p>
                                <p>Thirdly, we are still not sure whether raider off Brazil is <hi rend="italic">Scheer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hiffer</hi>,
                                    but widespread movements are being made by us to meet either
                                    case. The more American ships cruising along the South American
                                    coast the better, as you, Sir, would no doubt hear what they saw
                                    or did not see. Raider might then find American waters rather
                                    crowded, or may anyhow prefer to go on to sort of trade route,
                                    where we are preparing.</p>
                                <p>We wish to help you in every way in keeping the war out of
                                    Americas.”</p>

                                    waters within the zone.</item>

                                <item>It would be a fundamental part of the scheme that it should be
                                    effective, i. e. not only that enemy action against territory,
                                    forces or shipping should be prevented, but also that the use of
                                    the area as a sanctuary in which raiders or supply ships might
                                    take refuge should be prevented. The question of the use of the
                                    area as a sanctuary is clearly very important because, unless
                                    such action were prevented, it would clearly facilitate greatly
                                    the operations of enemy raiders in areas outside the

                                    enemy into that area, because otherwise the existence of the
                                    zone might frequently enable a raider to escape destruction and
                                    subsequently emerge from the zone to re-commence raiding in some

                                    the operation of the scheme would greatly reduce the
                                    possibilities of obtaining such information for

                                    importance because the number now interned in various American
                                    ports might presumably, under the safety given by the scheme,
                                    resume trading on the American continent, so earning
                                    considerable quantities of foreign currency. Such trading would
                                    presumably in any case not be allowed unless the Germans
                                    themselves had accepted the scheme and respected it.”</item>

                                    considered as a communication not only from this Government but
                                    from all the other American Republics. It is, of course, the

                                        place the American Republics in the position of compromising

                                        the American Republics or, so far as this Government is
                                        informed, by any one of them, concerning the action to be
                                        taken with respect to belligerent merchant vessels in ports
                                        of the American Republics. It is to be supposed that if such
                                        vessels are allowed to trade between ports of the American
                                        Republics they will be permitted to do so only on condition
                                        of strict observance of the neutrality of the American
                                        Republics and with proper respect to the neutrality of the
                                        area in question, and on condition that their governments
                                        shall likewise respect the neutrality of the

                        <p>The Ambassador requested clarification of certain of the opinions of this
                            Government as I read them to him, but although he had received
                            voluminous instructions, which he had with him, he raised no points of
                            any significance in addition to those contained in Mr. Churchill’s
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador requested my interpretation of Point 1 of Mr. Churchill’s
                            memorandum, and I stated that it seemed to me that it was hardly
                            appropriate for me to undertake to interpret what seemed to be a very
                            clear and concise statement of the British First Lord of the Admiralty.
                            I said that it seemed that there could only be one interpretation given,
                            namely, that the British Government signified its intention to respect
                            the provisions of the Declaration of Panamá provided the other
                            belligerents likewise undertook to respect the terms of the declaration.
                            The Ambassador stated that he had not yet received from his Government
                            copies of the Churchill communications and that his instructions did not
                            go so far as the assertion contained in Point 1 of Mr. Churchill’s
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the final point, namely, the question of German merchant
                            vessels which had taken refuge in ports of the American Republics, the
                            Ambassador read to me a memorandum sent to him by his Government, of
                            which he promised to furnish me a copy and which copy is attached
                                herewith.<note n="6" xml:id="d119fn6">A notation at the bottom of
                                the page reads: “12–22–39. Memo not yet received.”</note> I inquired
                            in this connection what the attitude of the British Government would be
                            in the event that some American government, which had owing to it a
                            considerable volume of blocked marks in Germany which it could not
                            utilize and which it could not take out of Germany in the form of goods,
                            determined to take over German merchant vessels in its ports as payment
                            for such amounts owing to it. The Ambassador replied that he would
                            assume that if such action were taken unilaterally the British
                            Government would respect the transfer of flag resulting from such
                            action, but <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0099"/>that he would inquire
                            of his Government what their definitive opinion might be and give me a
                            reply accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this afternoon. I told the
                            Ambassador that there had been brought to my attention certain
                            complaints on the part of the governments of the other American
                            republics that ships plying from one American port to another in the
                            Western Hemisphere, when they stopped at the British possessions of
                            Barbados and Trinidad, had been unduly detained on the ground that the
                            British authorities in those parts desired to assure themselves that no
                            shipments were being made from one American republic to another
                            involving firms or individuals on the British black list. I said that it
                            had also come to my attention that German ships might have been attacked
                            and sunk within the restricted zone proclaimed in the Declaration of
                            Panama. I said to the Ambassador that I was making no representations in
                            the matter and that I would request him to regard this part of our
                            conversation as strictly informal and unofficial, but that I did want to
                            point out that if it was generally understood on the Western Hemisphere
                            that Great Britain had been responsible for a disregard of the zone
                            prescribed in the Declaration of Panama and was undertaking to interfere
                            with ordinary commercial or maritime communications between one American
                            republic and another, I was very confident that there would be a general
                            outburst antagonistic to Great Britain throughout the continent. I said
                            that I was making these observations in a preliminary fashion, and that
                            I had requested an immediate report with regard to the allegations as to
                            the interference with shipments from one American republic to another. I
                            told the Ambassador that if I had any positive information on this
                            point, I would seek an opportunity of speaking with him further.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Wilson</hi>: Briefly, as you will see from the
                            message we are sending up, the best information which we obtained from
                            the British Legation, the local maritime authorities here and other
                            sources, is as follows: About six o’clock yesterday morning off the
                            northeastern coast of Uruguay the British cruiser <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi>, the latter of which was engaged in
                            convoying a French merchant vessel, came into contact with the German
                            pocket battleship <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi> was damaged and the <hi rend="italic">Von
                                Spee</hi> made off. Then late yesterday afternoon, between 7 and 9
                            o’clock, off the place called Punta de Este, well outside Uruguayan
                            territorial waters, two further engagements occurred, in which both the
                                <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> were damaged. The <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi>
                            came into the port of Montevideo about midnight last night and I was
                            down to see her this morning. She is about 200 yards off shore. One of
                            the secretaries is now out in a launch going around her to look her
                            over. The casualties on the <hi rend="italic">Von Spee</hi> are 36 dead,
                            48 wounded on board the ship, and one wounded man has been brought
                            ashore into a military hospital.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi>
                            pursued the <hi rend="italic">Von Spee</hi> up to the Uruguayan
                            territorial waters and they are now believed to be lying about
                            twenty-five miles off shore. It is not known whether the <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi> is also there or whether she has made off
                            to the Falkland Islands for repairs. She was badly damaged. We have been
                            told in confidence by the maritime authorities here that the <hi rend="italic">Von Spee</hi> has received permission to remain in
                            port forty-eight hours and that this time may be extended if necessary
                            to make further repairs. It is of interest to note that the Uruguayan
                            law makes no distinction between repairs on account of gunfire damages
                            and those from natural causes.</p>
                        <p>That is the most reliable information which I have been able to get. I
                            have asked the Naval Attaché to come over from Buenos Aires by plane, if
                            possible, and we will try to check up and let you know more during the
                            day.</p>
                        <p>There were rumors all day yesterday about the battle, but late yesterday
                            afternoon the Foreign Office and the German Legation were entirely
                            without any knowledge and it was only later in the night that the
                            reports of what seems to have been the most serious engagement off Punta
                            de Este came in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Duggan</hi>: What was the first position?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilson</hi>: The first position was well off the
                            coast. Some people are saying two hundred miles, and the people who
                            perhaps would <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0101"/>know the most, the
                            British, are not saying. The first engagement was well out to sea.
                            Whether it was within the zone or not cannot be determined until the
                            exact position of the ship is known. We have no definite
                            information.</p>
                        <p>The second and third engagements took place not very far off the
                            Uruguayan coast outside territorial waters, but some reports say about
                            twelve sea miles. I do not know whether that is exact or not. The firing
                            could clearly be heard from the shore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Duggan</hi>: We will be interested in having
                            further information with regard to its stay in port.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilson</hi>: We shall watch that very
                            carefully.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Duggan</hi>: I spoke with Mr. Hackworth<note n="9" xml:id="d121fn9">Green H. Hackworth, Legal Adviser.</note> a
                            few moments ago. He told me that under international law he thought that
                            the ship might stay there only for a short time, twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilson</hi>: The reports are that permission has
                            been given for the ship to stay in port forty-eight hours. The
                            information which I just gave you is what I obtained from the Uruguayan
                            authorities. An official here said in confidence that he had told the
                            officer of the German vessel that the ship could remain in port 48 hours
                            and that the time would be extended if necessary to make further
                            repairs. There is no distinction between repairs on account of gunfire
                            and repairs on account of natural causes. This is all pretty
                            preliminary. We will check as we go along.</p>

                            vessel must depart as soon as the cause of the delay is at an end.</p>
                        <p>Article 17 provides that belligerent warships may make such repairs only
                            “as are absolutely necessary to render them seaworthy, and may not add
                            in any manner whatsoever to their fighting force”, also <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0102"/>that the local authorities of the

                            regard to the naval engagement which took place on December 13 off the

                                <p>“On the morning of December 13, 1939, a naval combat took place
                                    off the northeastern coast of Uruguay between certain British
                                    naval vessels and the German naval vessel <hi rend="italic">Graf
                                        von Spee</hi> after the latter is alleged to have attempted

                                    between Brazilian ports and the port of Montevideo, and after
                                    the <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi> is alleged to have sunk
                                    other merchant vessels in the same vicinity.</p>
                                <p>There would seem to be no question that all of these activities
                                    took place within the zone described in the Declaration of
                                    Panamá on October 3, 1939, the first paragraph of which reads as
                                    follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘1. As a measure of continental self-protection, the
                                            American Republics, so long as they maintain their
                                            neutrality, are as of inherent right entitled to have
                                            those waters adjacent to the American continent, which
                                            they regard as of primary concern and direct utility in
                                            their relations, free from the commission of any hostile
                                            act by any non-American belligerent nation, whether such
                                            hostile act be attempted or made from land, sea or
                                            air.’</p>

                                <p>From the evidence so far available it would appear that such
                                    interference with merchant shipping plying between the ports of
                                    one American Republic and the port of an adjacent American
                                    Republic took place within the zone fixed by the American
                                    Republics as that area which should be maintained free from
                                    belligerent activities in order to insure their own right to
                                    self-protection. Such interference has further been followed oy
                                    engagements between armed vessels of the opposing belligerents
                                    within the security zone. The Governments of the American
                                    Republics state that as soon as they have clearly ascertained
                                    the facts and established the responsibilities involved, they
                                    will, through the method of mutual consultation provided in the
                                    Declaration of Panamá, determine upon the representations which
                                    they should appropriately make, or determine the action to be
                                    taken individually or collectively in this case.”</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>You may further state that your Government believes that the security
                            zone established in the Declaration of Panama, if respected by the
                            belligerents, will afford a very great measure of security to all of the
                            American Republics and is calculated to avoid involvement of the
                            American Republics in controversies arising out of the European war. It
                            further believes that if this first flagrant violation by the
                            belligerents of the Declaration of Panamá is permitted to occur without
                            vigorous protest on the part of all of the American Republics, the
                            Declaration of Panamá will inevitably become a dead letter.</p>
                        <p>If the Governments of the American Republics are all in accord with

                            coast. They showed me a telegram from the Brazilian Ambassador at
                            Montevideo setting out that the Uruguayan Government had decided to
                            consult the American, Brazilian and Argentine Governments as to the
                            course to be pursued at the present juncture, having in mind the Panamá
                            Declaration. Aranha and Nabuco are very anxious to work in close
                            cooperation with the State Department and will not reply to Montevideo
                            until they hear from the Department. Aranha and Nabuco make three
                            suggestions for a reply: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>In view of the fact that the British insist that their vessels
                                    were attacked 180 miles from the coast when convoying merchant
                                    ships engaged in normal trade, the German ship can be defined as
                                    the aggressor in the case and therefore should be interned for
                                    the duration of the war; and the principle be laid down by the
                                    American nations that any belligerent naval vessel in the future
                                    taking refuge after a naval engagement in an American port be
                                    interned for the duration of the war. (Since the conversation I
                                    see in the press the S.S. <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi> may put
                                    into an Argentine port for repairs.) Aranha went on to remark
                                    that the United States and Brazil were both voluntarily keeping
                                    their ships out of the European danger zone, see my despatch No.

                                <item>In case the first suggestion seems too harsh the second
                                    suggestion is that all the nations of America protest to both
                                    belligerents citing the present instance and expressing the
                                    strong hope that similar instances will not occur again; or if
                                    it is clear that the German was the aggressor to protest to
                                    Germany alone.</item>

                                <item>His third suggestion would be that consultations among the
                                    American nations be not held if there is any possibility that
                                    common agreement cannot be reached on either of the two previous
                                    suggestions because in their opinion a failure to reach an
                                    agreement would have “deplorable results”. In that case Uruguay
                                    should apply its own neutrality laws.</item>

                        <p>237. From the Undersecretary. Your 432, December 15, 2 p.m., 434,
                            December 15, midnight, and 435, December 16, 10 a.m. Please express to
                            Aranha my appreciation of the very helpful opportunity he has afforded
                            this Government of exchanging views with the Brazilian Government
                            concerning the situation created by the recent naval action off the La
                            Plata River.</p>
                        <p>Please state that this Government fully agrees that the suggested
                            preliminary statement outlined in the Department’s circular of December
                            15, 1 p.m., should only be regarded as a first step. Our feeling has
                            been that it was desirable that some immediate indication be given by
                            all of the American Republics of the deep concern felt in this
                            hemisphere as a result of the violation of the security zone and that if
                            we should delay taking any action until after all of the facts in this
                            case were confirmed, so much time would have elapsed as to give the
                            impression to the belligerents that the American Republics were tacitly
                            acquiescent to the violation of the zone.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the proposal contained in the second part of numbered
                            paragraph 1 of your telegram 432, December 15, 2 p.m., warrants the very
                            favorable consideration of the American Republics in the consultation
                            which is now proposed. It may well be that if, after the facts are
                            clarified, it is positively ascertained that molestation of merchant
                            vessels within the security zone by the <hi rend="italic">Graf von
                                Spee</hi> was the cause of the naval engagement, the best course
                            would be for the American Republics jointly to make a protest to the
                            German Government and state that if any further violation of the zone
                            were undertaken by a German naval vessel, such vessel would be interned
                            if it took refuge in any port of the American Republics.</p>
                        <p>In view of all the circumstances, and in view of the fact that the
                            Uruguayan Government has already announced its decision with regard to
                            the status of the <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi>, it would seem to
                            this Government desirable with regard to the specific case of the
                            treatment by the Uruguayan Government of the <hi rend="italic">Graf von
                                Spee</hi> to adopt alternative numbered (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            listed in your telegram 435, December 16, 10 a.m.</p>
                        <p>Finally, this Government fully shares the belief expressed by Aranha that
                            no formal and public consultation take place unless it has been
                            previously ascertained that all of the American governments are in
                            general accord. [Welles.]</p>

                                patrol in support of the neutrality. He realizes other nations not
                                in position effectively to do so but suggests that some patrol by
                                each nation would be tangible evidence of each one’s sincerity in
                                the Declaration of Panama. Would appreciate our views.</p>

                                made at Panama. Chile wishes to go with her fellow American

                            statement which he has prepared on the basis of our draft but with
                            certain changes which he feels would make it stronger and more
                            effective. While he agrees that reference should be made to other
                            merchant vessels sunk by the <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi> he
                            points out that there have been similar cases of attack within the zone
                            by British war vessels since the Panamá Declaration and that some
                            reference to these should also be made.</p>
                        <p>Finally he feels that to impress the belligerents with the seriousness of
                            the situation, even in this preliminary declaration reference should be
                            made to steps which the American Republics may find it necessary to take
                            to prevent a repetition of similar incidents in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked me to state that of course these were only suggestions
                            and that he would be glad to consider any further observations we might
                            have to make although of course he agrees that the sooner the

                                    vessels and the German vessel <hi rend="italic">Graf von

                                <p>On the other hand, the sinking or detention of German merchant

                                    the Declaration of Panamá of October 3, 1939, the first
                                    paragraph of which establishes: (here follows quotation of

                                    American nations resolve to lodge a protest with the belligerent
                                    countries and to initiate the necessary consultation in order to
                                    strengthen the system of protection in common, through the
                                    adoption of rules to prevent belligerent vessels from supplying
                                    themselves and repairing damages in American ports, when the
                                    said vessels have committed warlike acts within the zone of

                        <p>138. Guani<note n="26" xml:id="d133fn26">Alberto Guani, Uruguayan
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> sent for me at 9 o’clock. He
                            said that he had spent 3 hours this afternoon talking with the German
                            Minister. He had tried to obtain a statement from the Minister that the
                                <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> would respect Uruguayan law and
                            either leave by 8 o’clock tomorrow night or be interned. The Minister
                            had refused to commit himself, and had insisted that more time was
                            needed for repairs. Guani had offered to propose on his own
                            responsibility to the President of Uruguay that the committee of naval
                            experts reexamine the question but on the condition that the German
                            Government give assurances beforehand that it would accept the
                            committee’s findings and act in accordance therewith. The German
                            Minister also refused to commit himself on this. Guani said that he was
                            convinced that if by 8 o’clock tomorrow night the <hi rend="italic">Spee</hi> has not found an opportunity to slip away, she will
                            resist internment.</p>
                        <p>He said that while he was being hammered on one side by the Germans, he
                            was under constant pressure on the other side from the British. He had
                            received numerous visits from the British Minister today, insisting that
                            the time limit could in no case be extended, and trying to obtain
                            assurances as to the steps Uruguay would take if the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> refuses to leave or be interned. Guani said that he
                            felt that the British were trying to build up a case of inability on the
                            part of Uruguay to enforce its neutrality laws, so as to be in a
                            position to claim greater freedom of action for themselves. For instance
                            the British Minister protested today because, so he alleges, the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> had fired one of its anti-aircraft guns
                            at an airplane from the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> flying
                            several miles at sea. This was of course absurd.</p>
                        <p>Guani then said that he wished me to transmit formally a message to my
                            Government from the Uruguayan Government to the following effect: that
                            in the event the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> by 8 o’clock tomorrow
                            night has not left Montevideo and refuses to be interned, the Uruguayan
                            Government will lack the necessary military force to compel the warship
                            to be interned. He intends to transmit similar messages to the Argentine
                            Government and the Brazilian Government. Then, if the contingency takes
                            place and the British protest or try to take matters into their own
                            hands, he will inform them that he is in consultation with governments
                            of the American Republics concerning the matter.</p>

                            the receipt of Your Excellency’s note of December 15th,<note n="28" xml:id="d134fn28">Note was based on circular telegram of December

                            Government a proposal of the Department of State that my Government join
                            the other American countries in representations to Germany and Great
                            Britain with regard to the situation off the Uruguayan coast between
                            warships belonging to those States and within the Zone of Security
                            created by the unanimous resolution of the Meeting of the Foreign
                            Ministers of the American Republics for Consultation which took place in
                            Panama in September of this year.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency adds that your Government suggests that this
                            representation be made through the Government of Panama as soon as
                            information has been received with regard to the exact site in which the
                            battle in question took place and the extent of participation in it of
                            the belligerent countries.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that my Government
                            accepts the suggestion of the Government of the United States that a
                            joint declaration be made to manifest to the belligerents the
                            desirability of respecting the Zone of Security created by the Meeting
                            at Panama with a view to avoiding subsequent legal decisions which
                            might, at a given moment, be construed as in opposition to one or the
                            other of the groups at war.</p>
                        <p>In this respect, I take this opportunity to inform Your Excellency’s
                            Government that a similar act has just been produced off the Chilean
                            coast, also within the Zone of Security under reference.</p>
                        <p>The British cruiser <hi rend="italic">Despatch</hi> yesterday captured
                            the German merchant ship <hi rend="italic">Dusseldorf</hi> 20 miles off
                            the Chilean coast opposite the port of Caldera, thereby committing an
                            act of war which, although permitted by the laws and usages now in
                            force, has taken place within the Security Zone.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, my Government believes that this same opportunity could be
                            availed of to include in the projected representation the case in
                            question.</p>

                        <p>139. My 136, December 16, 6 p.m.<note n="29" xml:id="d135fn29">Not
                                printed.</note> In my conversation with Guani last night (my number
                            138, December 16, 10 p.m.) I asked if he could give me a reply
                            concerning the Department’s draft statement. He said that he had had no
                            time to consider it and that in the meantime Cantilo had communicated
                            with him and proposed a counterdraft. Cantilo felt that our draft did
                            not go far enough: he wanted to mention not only the recent incidents
                            but also the British sinking of various German merchant vessels which
                            had left South American ports for Europe. Cantilo also wanted the
                            decision to read that henceforth belligerent warships would not be
                            allowed to take refuge in ports of the American Republics. Guani said he
                            was heartily in favor of this last point, and asked my opinion.</p>
                        <p>I said that I thought the essential thing was to get out a preliminary
                            protest without delay. After this was done the point about belligerent
                            warships, and any other pertinent questions, could be dealt with in the
                            consultation mentioned in our draft. Guani said he was inclined to agree
                            but was so harried by the Germans and the British on the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> business that he could not find time to
                            consider the question carefully: he would try to do so and give me a
                            definite answer as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I believe that anything that Argentina, Brazil and we agree upon will be
                            satisfactory to Guani.</p>

                        <p>439. Department’s 237, December 16, 2 p.m. Cantilo is urgently requesting
                            Aranha’s support for his draft of protest to be made in connection with
                            Declaration of Panama. Aranha says in his opinion Cantilo’s note is

                        <p>442. My 439, December 17, 11 a.m. Aranha telegraphed Cantilo setting out
                            that in his opinion matter of text of the note <hi rend="italic">in
                                re</hi> Declaration of Panama is now secondary: that he thinks well
                            of Cantilo’s suggested text but in some respects considers your
                            suggested text better. He remarked to me “Why does Cantilo drag in the
                            incident off the Chilean coast which concerns Chile and to which Chile
                            has apparently made no objection”.</p>

                        <p>Department’s circular December 15, 1 p.m. You are requested to call
                            immediately upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government to
                            which you are accredited and inform him that messages have now been
                            received by this Government from all of the other American governments
                            commenting upon the proposed draft statement transmitted in the
                            Department’s circular of December 15, 1 p.m. It has been gratifying to
                            find that all of the American republics were in unanimous agreement that
                            a statement should be issued and that this statement should be made as
                            quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Government, using as a basis the original draft, has
                            suggested certain changes which it feels desirable to make the statement
                            more effective. It is hoped that these changes, which meet with the
                            entire approval of this Government, will likewise find favor with the
                            Government to which you are accredited.</p>
                        <p>The draft statement suggested by Argentina reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text quoted in telegram No. 291, December 16, 4 p.m., from
                            the Ambassador in Argentina, printed on <ref target="#pg_100">page
                                100</ref>.]</p>
                        <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0114"/>
                        <p>In as much as the effectiveness of the statement will be heightened by
                            its issuance within the next 24 to 48 hours while the <hi rend="italic">Graf von Spee</hi> incident is still vivid in people’s minds, it is
                            earnestly hoped that the Argentine redraft will be accepted without
                            further modification by the Government to which you are accredited.
                            Please endeavor to expedite a reply.</p>

                        <p>The press carries the text of a note addressed by the German Minister to
                            the Foreign Office protesting against the “flagrant” violation of
                            international law by the Uruguayan Government in not affording
                            sufficient time for repairs to make the vessel seaworthy.</p>
                        <p>German Minister also released to the press a note addressed to him by the
                            commanding Officer of the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> which
                            indicates that the Germans have not lost their aptitude for misjudging
                            the psychology of other peoples. The note criticises violently the
                            attitude of the Uruguayan Government, alleges that it acted under
                            pressure of the British Government and comments that while the
                            commanding officer had means of exerting pressure he had refrained from
                            doing so. Public opinion, which had become sympathetic as a result of
                            the moving scenes at the sailors’ funeral and the plight of the warship,
                            has been most unfavorably impressed by this offensive communication.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest to note that in the communication in question the
                            commanding officer of the German warship states: “On the morning of the

                        <p>297. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me last night that the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil had suggested to him an addition
                            to Cantilo’s draft declaration submitted in the Embassy’s telegram No.
                            291 of December 16, 4 p.m. This additional paragraph referred to the
                            sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> and upheld the Uruguayan
                            Government’s position in the incident.</p>
                        <p>Cantilo further informed me that Aranha had suggested the possibility of
                            having the declaration agreed upon submitted to the three belligerents
                            by the Uruguayan Government as further support by the American Republics
                            of Uruguay. I presume these matters have been submitted to the
                            Department by the Brazilian Government direct.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office has confirmed to me the Argentine Government’s
                            decision to intern the captain, officers and crew of the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi>. They arrived here yesterday and the
                            party numbers 1,040. The Government is admittedly perplexed as to the
                            method of interning so large a number and no decision as to place has as
                            yet been reached.</p>

                        <p>448. For the Under Secretary. Last paragraph of Department’s circular
                            telegram of December 18, 4 p.m., and Department’s telegram No. 238,

                        <p>Aranha says that, of course, he wants always to be in agreement with you
                            and, if you insist upon it, he will agree to the text as set out in the
                            Department’s circular. However, he believes that it will be a “grave
                            mistake” not to take notice of the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Spee</hi> as the Germans, in his opinion, undoubtedly would allege
                            in reply that they had sunk the <hi rend="italic">Spee</hi> only because
                            they did not wish to violate Uruguayan neutrality measures; that on the
                            other hand, the American Governments had taken no steps in connection
                            with the presence of British cruisers in the vicinity of Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the addition of words “among which” (my telegram No. 446,
                            December 18, 1 p.m.<note n="33" xml:id="d143fn33">Not printed.</note>)
                            he says that he makes that suggestion in view of the fact that article
                            22 of Brazil’s neutrality law goes even further than the suggested
                            “rules to prevent belligerent vessels, et cetera”.</p>
                        <p>In connection with these two matters he received this morning the
                            following telegram from his Ambassador at Buenos Aires <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>149. Your circular December 18, 4 p.m. I saw Guani at 1 o’clock. He
                            received the Argentine counter-draft late last night. He told me that he
                            was not in agreement with the latter part of the final paragraph. This
                            would mean that a belligerent vessel which defended a merchant vessel
                            within the zone of security against an attack by another belligerent
                            vessel could not supply itself or repair-damages thereafter in American
                            ports. This he considers unjust. It would mean that the <hi rend="italic">Exeter</hi>, which was defending the <hi rend="italic">Formose</hi>, could not be received in the port of Montevideo. He
                            stated that Uruguayan public opinion would never accept this.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0117"/>
                        <p>He appreciates the urgency of a declaration and prefers the last
                            paragraph of our original draft. He said that he would study the matter
                            at once to see if he could find a formula to reconcile the Argentine
                            counterdraft with his objection thereto. He will speak with Cantilo by
                            telephone and advise me later.</p>

                            scuttled. She had encountered a British destroyer, the <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi>, the United
                            States heavy cruiser engaged in observation of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi>, was supposed to have been released from such duty at
                            1 o’clock today, but at the time of the action, approximately 3:30 p.m.,
                            the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> was present, and the Captain at
                            once reported that he was standing by to pick up the survivors. He was
                            ordered, after having completed that task, to put into the nearest
                            United States port, which in this case would be Boston.</p>
                        <p>In a subsequent telephone call at 4:25 p.m. Commander Struble informed me
                            that by moving northward the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> had
                            actually approached nearer to our shores, so that the action occurring
                            at 3:30 p.m. took place only 300 miles, approximately, from our shore.
                            Also, the Commander stated that the White House was informed and desired
                            no release whatever of information until the White House released
                            it.</p>

                        <p>In a telephone call at 5:05 p.m. today the Navy Department informed that
                            instructions had been issued to the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi>
                            that when she had completed the task of rescuing the survivors from the
                                <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> she was to put in to the port of New
                            York. While it is not possible as yet to say just when the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> will arrive in New York, it is likely
                            that she will arrive late tomorrow afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Upon being questioned as to whether the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi>
                            had been released from her observation duty, I was informed that release
                            from such duty was to take place not at a given hour but at a given
                            longitude <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0118"/>and that the
                            calculations of the Navy Department were on an approximate basis, that
                            that point would have been reached by about 1 o’clock today. It appears
                            that instead of that longitude having been reached at that hour the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> was still engaged in observation at
                            the time when the British destroyer <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi> came
                            into view and the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> began to
                            scuttle the ship. If the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> had completed
                            her observation duty she would have turned about to return to her base
                            in Hampton Roads.</p>

                            and the Department’s circular December 18, 4 p.m., the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs has just given me the changes in the draft statement
                            suggested by the Brazilian Government. These consist in the insertion of
                            the following sentence at the end of first paragraph. “They are also
                            informed of the entry and scuttling of the German war ship in waters of
                            the River Plate upon the termination of the time limit which, in
                            accordance with the rules of international law, was granted to it by the
                            Government of the Republic of Uruguay.”</p>
                        <p>Also in paragraph 4 after the words strengthen the system of protection
                            in common “through the adoption of adequate rules among them those which
                            would prevent”. In other words this portion of the paragraph to read
                            “strengthen the system of protection in common <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0119"/>through the adoption of adequate rules
                            among them those which would prevent belligerent vessels et cetera.”</p>
                        <p>As already stated it is presumed that these suggested changes have been
                            taken up with the Department by the Brazilian Government. Dr. Cantilo
                            has asked me to state that the Brazilian authorities<note n="35" xml:id="d148fn35">Hans Thomsen.</note> suggestions meet with the
                            approval of the Argentine Government.</p>

                        <p>237. Department’s circular December 18, 4 p.m. Chile accepts the
                            declaration. She would prefer that it be modified so that the proposed
                            sanction be applied not merely to the transgressing vessel but to all
                            vessels of the belligerent to which the vessel belongs. If this
                            strengthening of the sanction is not deemed acceptable or is deemed to
                            involve too great delay Chile does not wish to insist but is willing to
                            have the present message constitute an acceptance of the declaration in
                            its present form.</p>

                        <p>A telephoned message from the Navy Department at 9:30 a.m. today informs
                            that the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> has now on board 579
                            survivors from the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi>, of whom 9 are women.
                            The <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> is expected to be at Ambrose
                            Lightship by 3 p.m. today, which should bring her to Ellis Island
                            between 4 and 4:30 p.m. today. It is stated that examination discloses
                            no communicable disease among the survivors.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> was settling slowly at last report,
                            and in the opinion of the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi>
                            she should have been under water by 9 o’clock last night. All sea valves
                            of the ship were opened. Until the ship has sunk she constitutes a
                            menace to navigation in her present location, which is latitude 38–01
                            North and longitude 65–41 West, or 540 miles east of Norfolk and 460
                            miles southeast of New York. Due to the curvature of our coast, this
                            location is only about 320 miles from Cape Cod.</p>

                        <p>The German Chargé d’Affaires<note n="35" xml:id="d151fn35">Hans
                                Thomsen.</note> came in this morning to express the appreciation and
                            thanks of the German Government for the prompt rescue by the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> of the officers and crew of the S.S.
                                <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi>, which apparently was scuttled by
                            its own officers at a point approximately midway between Cape Hatteras
                            and Bermuda. Dr. Thomsen said that the rescue work of the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> had been magnificently performed, and
                            had called forth from the German Government the deepest feeling of
                            gratitude and appreciation.</p>
                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires then said that as far as the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> itself was concerned, he had nothing further to say,
                            as he had not had any official report of the occurrence, but he was
                            under the impression that no belligerent act had been performed in
                            connection with its sinking. He said that he would await the report of
                            the Captain of the ship and any information which might come from the
                            Captain and officers of the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi>, if
                            such reports were made available to him.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Thomsen further stated that he thought it was an excellent idea to
                            take the officers and crew of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi> to
                            Ellis Island, as the immigration authorities there would be organized to
                            take care of such a large number of men. He said that with respect to
                            the disposition of these men, he would await reports from the German
                            Consul General in New York after he had communicated with the
                            immigration authorities at Ellis Island. He said that one thought which
                            had occurred to him was the advisability of sending these men back to
                            Germany by way of the Pacific, as there were no German ships in New
                            York, or, in fact, in any American port which would be capable of
                            maintaining these men. He said, however, any arrangements of that kind
                            would have to await discussions with the American immigration
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Thomsen asked that an expression of the appreciation of the German
                            Government for the rescue of the officers and crew of the <hi rend="italic">Tuscaloosa</hi> be conveyed to the Secretary of the
                            Navy.</p>

                            Panamanian Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that his Government

                        <p>Department’s circular of December 18, 4 p.m. For your information the
                            draft statement suggested by Argentina has been approved by the
                            following republics: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba,
                            Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico and
                            Venezuela, and by Brazil in principle.</p>
                        <p>The following message has been received from the American Chargé
                            d’Affaires at Lima: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Minister for Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the Peruvian
                                    diplomatic representatives in Uruguay and Brazil to ascertain if
                                    those countries have approved the Argentine draft. The Minister
                                    for Foreign Affairs personally favors internment of belligerent
                                    vessels instead of action suggested in last paragraph of
                                    Argentina draft. A definite reply has been promised by the
                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs as soon as he hears from Montevideo
                                    and Rio de Janeiro.”</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>It is the belief of the Department that the reference in the Argentine
                            statement to “the adoption of rules to prevent belligerent vessels from
                            supplying themselves and repairing damages in American ports” is
                            sufficiently general to permit of a careful study by the American
                            republics of all the methods which may be open to them to attain the
                            objectives set forth in the Declaration of Panama, and that it would not
                            be desirable to delay the issue of the statement now under consideration
                            pending a definition of those methods.</p>

                        <p>175. Your 237, December 19, 10 p.m. It is the belief of the Department
                            that the reference in the Argentine statement to “the adoption of rules
                            to prevent belligerent vessels from supplying themselves and repairing
                            damages in American ports” is sufficiently general to permit of a
                            careful study by the American republics of all the methods which may be
                            open to them to attain the objectives set forth in the Declaration of
                            Panama, and that it would not be desirable to delay the issue of the
                            statement now under consideration pending a definition of those
                            methods.</p>
                        <p>This opinion has been communicated to our Embassies in Rio de Janeiro,
                            Montevideo and Buenos Aires and may be communicated informally in your
                            discretion to the Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Department
                            is gratified to note that the Chilean Government is in agreement as to
                            the urgency of issuing this statement.</p>

                        <p>155. Your circular December 20, 2 p.m. I have just seen Guani. He wrote
                            out in my presence the following which he will telegraph to Cantilo and
                            which he authorized me to transmit to you as his reply to our inquiry:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>304. Department’s rush circular December 20, 2 p.m. I brought this matter
                            to the attention of the Foreign Minister late last night. Dr. Cantilo
                            informed me that he is in entire agreement with the Department, that the
                            language referred to in the last paragraph of the Department’s telegram
                            is sufficiently general to permit of a careful study by the American
                            Republics of methods which may be open to them to obtain the objectives
                            set forth in the Declaration of Panama and more specifically to permit
                            the consideration later of the Peruvian Foreign Minister’s suggestion.
                            Dr. Cantilo felt that this would be even more the case if it is decided
                            to include Dr. Aranha’s suggested changes in paragraph 4 (see Embassy’s
                            telegram 299, December 19, 8 p.m.).</p>
                        <p>After my talk with Dr. Cantilo he spoke with the Peruvian Ambassador who
                            was also present at the dinner and then asked me to speak to him, which
                            I did. The Peruvian Ambassador appeared to consider the subject
                            favorably and stated that he would so inform his Government.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador<note n="37" xml:id="d157fn37">Count de
                                Saint-Quentin.</note> called to see me this afternoon. The
                            Ambassador asked me what the status of the anticipated protest on the
                            part of the American Republics to the belligerents might be with regard
                            to the violation of the Declaration of Panama. I informed the Ambassador
                            of the nature of the protest and of the consultation which would
                            thereafter take place. I also indicated some of the practical steps of
                            implementation which would come up for consideration. The Ambassador
                            gave me clearly to understand that he personally had advised his
                            Government to declare its willingness to respect the neutral zone and he
                            seemed to be particularly pleased that the French Government had not
                            been involved in the recent incidents which had occurred in violation of
                            the zone. He hastened to assure me, however, that the British and the
                            French were as one with regard to all questions arising out of the
                            war.</p>

                        <p>Department’s circular telegram December 18, 4 p.m. Please inform the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government to which you are
                            accredited that this Government is happy to state that all of the other
                            American governments approve the text of the proposed statement
                            transmitted in the Department’s circular above referred to. By way of
                            improvement and without introducing new questions of principle, the
                            Governments of Argentina and Brazil have suggested two minor amendments
                            as follows:</p>
                           <p>(1) That there be inserted between the first and second
                                        paragraphs anew paragraph reading as follows:</p>
                                    <p>“They are also informed of the entry and scuttling of the
                                        German warship in the waters of the River Plate upon the
                                        termination of the time limit which, in accordance with the
                                        rules of international law, was granted to it by the
                                        Government of the Republic of Uruguay.”</p>
                                <p>(2) That beginning with the words “in order to strengthen the
                                    system of protection in common” the next clause read “through
                                    the adoption of adequate rules, among them those which would
                                    prevent belligerent vessels et cetera”.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as these minor changes would seem to be noncontroversial
                            improvements and thus should meet with the favor of the other American
                            governments, and in order to expedite the issuance of the statement,
                            this Government has felt that it could propose to the Government of
                            Panama that that Government transmit the text of the statement to each
                            of the three belligerents on Saturday, December 23, at 5 p.m. E.S.T., if
                            prior to that time no adverse comment has been received by this
                            Government and transmitted to the Government of Panama.</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that the text of the statement be released to the press
                            in all countries at the time that the text is communicated by the
                            Government of Panama to the three belligerents. Unless you receive a
                            rush telegram in clear from the Department requesting delay for any
                            reason, the text may be released by the Government to which you are
                            accredited on Saturday, December 23, at 5 p.m.</p>

                        <p>This Government was very pleased to learn of the acceptance of the
                            redraft by the Government of Panama and of the President’s intention to

                            governments have approved the text. Please inform Dr. Garay that in view
                            of the urgency, the Department took the liberty of suggesting the

                            desire to introduce it with some brief statement to the effect that the
                            statement has been drawn up by the governments of all the American
                            republics after consultation in accordance with the provisions of
                            numbered paragraph 3 of the Declaration of Panama.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this morning at his request. He
                            stated that he had been away from Washington for a day and a half and
                            was anxious to get from me such information as I might care to give him
                            with regard to the action which the newspapers asserted the 21 American
                            Republics are going to take in protesting to Great Britain and to
                            Germany with regard to the recent violations of the neutrality zone.</p>
                        <p>I gave the Ambassador a summary of the situation, advising him of the
                            nature of the protest which would be made, and making it clear that the
                            precise steps which will be taken by the American Republics <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0126"/>in implementation of the Declaration of
                            Panama would only be determined after consultation between them, and
                            that this consultation presumably would be held as rapidly as possible
                            after the protest was delivered.</p>
                        <p>I discussed with the Ambassador in some detail the nature of some of the
                            steps which might be taken, indicating that this Government would
                            support the taking of such measures as the refusal on the part of all of
                            the American Republics of fuel or provisions, or any other facilities to
                            any belligerent warship which violated the terms of the Declaration of
                            Panama, and to any belligerent merchant vessel which might act as an
                            auxiliary through the furnishing of fuel and provisions obtained in an
                            American port to a warship at sea. I said that it was probable that
                            other further steps would be taken up for consideration but that I felt
                            quite sure that the steps I had mentioned would in any event be taken up
                            in the proposed consultation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked me a good many hypothetical questions which I told
                            him I would undertake to answer, not in any official manner, but merely
                            in order to let the Ambassador know how our minds in this Government
                            were running at this juncture. A great majority of these questions, as I
                            reminded the Ambassador, had already been dealt with in my previous
                            conversations with him on this question.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture the Ambassador said that under international law British
                            warships had a complete right to undertake any belligerent activities
                            they pleased outside of the three-mile limit of the American coastline.
                            I replied by saying that I was not prepared at this juncture to discuss
                            the application of international law to the question at issue, and I
                            added that I should be glad to know whether the Ambassador desired to
                            raise for discussion the application of international law to the recent
                            British Order-in-Council<note n="39" xml:id="d161fn39">Of November 28.
                                See telegram No. 2481, November 29, 3 p.m., from the Ambassador in
                                the United Kingdom, <ref target="frus1939v01#pg_783">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 783</ref>.</note> asserting the
                            right of the British Government to seize all German exports carried in
                            neutral vessels, destined for neutral countries. The Ambassador replied
                            that he did not.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that public opinion in this country recognized that
                            Great Britain was waging a war of a very grave character and had not up
                            to now demanded of this Government that we insist upon the determination
                            of the questions raised by the British Order-in-Council in accordance
                            with generally accepted international law. At the same time, I said that
                            British Government should realize that the Government of the United
                            States as well as the other American Republics felt entirely warranted
                            in asserting their legitimate right of self-protection and their right
                            to secure their non-involvment in the European war, and that it was for
                            that reason as a practical measure <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0127"/>that the Declaration of Panama had been proclaimed. I
                            said, moreover, that I thought the Ambassador would realize that public
                            opinion in this country was more and more interested in the preservation
                            of the neutral zone determined by the Declaration of Panama and that
                            unquestionably a great deal of feeling had been created by the alleged
                            violation by British warships of the terms of the Declaration,
                            particularly within the past few days.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I should like for a moment to drop any official
                            character and speak to the Ambassador quite informally. I said that it
                            seemed to me that the British Government had been singularly stupid,
                            immediately after the occurrence of the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi>
                            incident in which it had been clear that the German Government had taken
                            the lead in the violation of the neutrality zone, in permitting British
                            vessels on the Pacific to seize a German steamer only 30 miles off the
                            Chilean coast and to follow that up by firing shots across the bow of a
                            German freighter almost within the territorial waters of Florida, as
                            well as shots across the bow of the <hi rend="italic">Columbus</hi>
                            within the neutral zone. The Ambassador at once replied that he
                            completely agreed with me, that he had two days ago telegraphed his
                            Government in that sense, and that he had only this morning received a
                            reply from his Government stating that they coincided in his opinion and
                            had issued orders to the British destroyer <hi rend="italic">Orion</hi>
                            to leave the waters of the neutral zone. I said I was glad to hear
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador reiterated emphatically that the British Government would
                            agree to respect the neutral zone provided Germany agreed to respect it,
                            and that its one chief objective was to avoid any disagreement between
                            the British and the United States Governments on this issue from being
                            so protracted as to involve recrimination and acrimony on both sides. I
                            said I heartily shared this view, and that it seemed to me that a very
                            helpful step in that sense would be for the British Government
                            officially and publicly to announce that it intended to respect the zone
                            provided it was respected by the other belligerents.</p>
                        <p>Before he left the Ambassador said that if the American Republics
                            determined, as an implementation of the Declaration of Panama, to decree
                            the internment of any British warship that might visit an American port
                            after violating the zone, a very serious question would arise. I merely
                            remarked that it seemed to me altogether premature to discuss what the
                            American Republics might or might not determine, and that while such a
                            course might eventually be determined upon, it seemed to me more likely
                            that the first steps to be agreed upon would be limited to the refusal
                            of fuel and provisions. I emphasized, however, that from all information
                            reaching me, public opinion throughout the continent was becoming more
                            and more determined that every practical means should be found to obtain
                            respect for the zone.</p>
                        <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador handed me a copy of an affidavit made by the late master
                            of the British motor tanker <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> who was a
                            prisoner aboard the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi> in which the

                        <p>156. Your circular, December 21, 6 p.m. Guani states that the Uruguayan
                            Government in releasing the statement to the press tomorrow at 7 p.m.
                            Montevideo time will add that the Uruguayan Government accepted the
                            statement in principle with reservations.</p>
                        <p>He states that this is absolutely necessary because the President and the
                            Council of Ministers are flatly opposed to the action suggested in the
                            last paragraph of Argentina draft, and which remains unaffected by the
                            second amendment contained in your circular under reference.</p>

                        <p>243. Referring further Department’s circular telegram, December 21, 6
                            p.m., Chilean Government now definitely accepts textually the safety
                            zone statement and will give the text to press this afternoon at 5:00
                            standard time, 6:00 Chilean time. This acceptance is based on assumption
                            arising from Department’s telegram No. 175, December <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0129"/>20, 7 p.m., that Chile’s various
                            suggestions can be given careful study by the American Republics during
                            the consultations which will follow the issuance of the statement. Chile
                            assumes that in the consultation provided for in the Panama Conference
                            the propositions she has made will be given due consideration.</p>

                        <p>178. Your 241, December 22, noon. The Department agrees with the view set
                            forth by Ortega and reported in your 229, December 16, 3 p.m., to the
                            effect that the establishment of patrols by the American republics would
                            be tangible evidence of their sincere support of the Declaration of
                            Panama and would no doubt result in the accumulation of valuable

                        <p>2720. Personal for the President from Naval Person: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We have always conformed to undertaking not to use British
                                    submarines inside your zone and I am very sorry there seems to
                                    be trouble about recent incidents. We cannot always refrain from
                                    stopping enemy ships outside international 3-mile limit when
                                    these may well be supply ships for U-boats or surface raiders,
                                    but instructions have been given only to arrest or fire upon
                                    them out of sight of United States shores. As a result of action
                                    off Plate whole South Atlantic is now clear and may perhaps
                                    continue clear of warlike operations. This must be a blessing to
                                    South American Republics whose trade was hampered by activities
                                    of raider and whose ports were used for his supply ships and
                                    information centers. In fact we have rescued all this vast area
                                    from war disturbances. Earnestly hope this will be valued by
                                    South American States who may likely for long periods enjoy in
                                    practice not only 300 but 3,000 miles limit. Laws of war gave
                                    raider right capture, or sink after providing for crews, all
                                    trade with us in South Atlantic. No protest was made about this
                                    although it injured Argentine commercial interests. Why then
                                    should complaints be made of our action in ridding seas of this
                                    raider in strict accordance with same international laws from
                                    which we had been suffering? Trust matter can be allowed to die
                                    down and see no reason why any trouble should occur unless
                                    another raider is sent which is unlikely <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0130"/>after fate of first. South
                                    American States should see in Plate action their deliverance
                                    perhaps indefinitely from all animosity. Much of world duty is
                                    being thrown on admiralty. Hope burden will not be made too
                                    heavy for us to bear. Even a single raider loose in North
                                    Atlantic requires employment half our battle fleet to give sure
                                    protection. Now unlimited magnetic mining campaign adds to
                                    strain upon flotillas and small craft. We are at very lull
                                    extension till the new war-time construction of anti-submarine
                                    craft begins to flow from May onwards. If we should break under
                                    load South American Republics would soon have worse worries than
                                    the sound of one day’s distant seaward cannonade. And you also,
                                    Sir, in quite a short time would have more direct cares. I ask
                                    that full consideration should be given to strain upon us at
                                    this crucial period and best construction put upon action
                                    indispensable to end war shortly in right way.</p>
                                <p>“In case you may be interested in details of recent action am

                        <p>The British Ambassador called at his own request. He said that he had
                            already made known in detail to Mr. Welles the British views on the
                            safety zone arising from the Declaration of Panama; that his Government
                            desired that he call and discuss these matters with me. He then
                            proceeded to say that his Government is very much concerned lest the
                            introduction of sanctions envisaged by the protest of the twenty-one
                            American republics to the belligerents really contemplates the use of
                            force. The Ambassador expressed the opinion that such a policy of force
                            would be calculated to lead from one incident to another until the
                            friendly relations between our two Governments might be badly injured in
                            case that another Government desired to bring about such a situation. By
                            way of illustration, he said that, if British naval vessels felt obliged
                            to enter this safety zone to deal with vessels, such as the <hi rend="italic">Graf Spee</hi>, some of the Governments might consider
                            that such British ships should not be allowed to enter their harbors to
                            secure supplies; or in any event that there might well be incidents
                            where the British Government would be thus precluded. He then said that
                            there was really no international law to justify the designation of the
                            300–mile boundary around the Americas, thereby making it possible for
                            German merchant ships to carry on business between any American <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0131"/>ports and be at all times safe
                            from possible British interference, and also make it possible for German
                            armed vessels to occupy such area without disturbance from the British,
                            so long as they refrained from such hostile or other acts as are
                            expressly prohibited by the Declaration of Panama. He elaborated in an
                            effort to cite other possible situations leading to similar results. He
                            stated that naturally his Government had no desire to send its fleets
                            into American waters with the view to any naval engagement or act of
                            hostility, but that it could not well refrain from doing so without
                            turning over all of these American waters to German merchant vessels and
                            even German naval vessels just so long as they complied with the
                            technical requirements aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>I replied that, since the Ambassador had talked this matter out in detail
                            with Mr. Welles, I would not undertake to enter into a detailed
                            discussion with him now, and I thanked him for coming in.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: It occurs to me that you may
                            be interested in reactions here toward the Panama Declaration and
                            particularly toward the fixing of the security zone and the protests
                            against its violation. This especially since I have thought it proper to
                            telegraph the Department concerning the attitude of the Government here.
                            That the agreement at Panama was accepted in good faith by the
                            authorities here I have no doubt. At the time I put the matter up to
                            Ortega he gave clear indications of the importance he attached to the
                            provision whereby problems growing out of the neutrality stand would be
                            submitted to the Committee of Experts on Neutrality representing the
                            various American nations. When the press associations sent from
                            Washington to Chilean papers the latest proposition regarding the
                            protest over the violation of Uruguayan waters, and unintentionally
                            perhaps gave the impression that this was decided upon in conferences
                            between the United States, Brazil and Argentina, I found some puzzlement
                            here and a perceptible cooling of the atmosphere. The fact that this
                            article appeared to find no violation worth mentioning in the capture of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Dusseldorf</hi> by a British cruiser off the <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0132"/>coast of Chile, and especially
                            after Ortega had submitted to Washington the propriety of including this
                            along with the affair off Uruguay in the protest, was taken, I am
                            afraid, as a slight. The further fact that no comment has come from
                            Washington on Ortega’s assumption, officially conveyed, that all such
                            matters would be considered by the Committee of Experts has not failed
                            of notice.</p>
                        <p>These matters perhaps are not of great importance, but the Chileans are
                            very sensitive where they feel their dignity involved, and especially
                            sensitive when however unintentionally the impression is given that
                            Argentina and Brazil are accepted as the spokesmen of South American
                            policy, with Chile left out. My own belief is that Argentina was the red
                            rag in this instance.</p>
                        <p>I am sure it is just as well that especial pains should be taken, in view
                            of this jealousy, not to permit the impression to get out that Chile is
                            taken for granted.</p>
                        <p>The political opposition, acting through <hi rend="italic">El
                                Mercurio</hi> and its publisher Agustín Edwards, is rather bitterly
                            attacking the extent of the security zone fixed at Panama, and several
                            editorial leaders, not at all friendly to us, have appeared on
                            successive days and especially since the decision about the protest.
                            While not openly attacking the Government here for its adhesion at
                            Panama and its agreement on the protest the attacks nevertheless are
                            calculated to convey the notion that the rights and dignity of Chile are
                            not in very safe keeping in the hands of the Government. Since it is the
                            Government which has made common cause with us on the neutrality policy
                            I am persuaded that the utmost tact should be exercised in dealing with
                            Chile on these matters. It has occurred to me as quite possible that the
                            Department has been in touch with Bianchi, if not the Chilean
                            Ambassador, on all these things but it is evident, in that event, that
                            they have not taken the trouble to inform the Government here.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> was distinctly neutral on the war
                            until the return of Agustín Edwards, for some years Chilean Ambassador
                            in London. Since his return the paper has become most militantly
                            pro-Ally, or rather pro-English. I have a feeling that Britain now has
                            two Ambassadors in Santiago, Edwards and Bentinck, and that the former
                            is by odds the more aggressive. He is notoriously an idolator of England
                            and he remains, as during the Spanish war, pro-Chamberlain. I am
                            enclosing an extract from an <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi>
                                editorial,<note n="41" xml:id="d168fn41">Not reprinted.</note>
                            believed to have been written by him, in which he is a bit nasty toward
                            the United States. This grows out of our attitude on the safety zone,
                            and this reflects the bitter opposition to it of the British Embassy
                            here, members of which openly say they will ignore it.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>Last night I dined at Cruchaga’s in honor of the retiring Peruvian
                            Ambassador and all the guests were outstanding leaders, Senators, of the
                            Conservative Party except Ortega, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was
                            given a most friendly and considerate reception. The definite news of
                            the ministerial crisis and the resignation of Wachholtz came during the
                            evening and I had the opportunity under the most favorable circumstances
                            to discuss the significance of the change with the opposition leaders of
                            the Right. Both Cruchaga and Senator Walker, leader of the Conservative
                            Party, talked frankly and I think objectively. It was their opinion that
                            the political situation is not changed in the least. Cruchaga thinks
                            that a more serious change may come in about a year. He added that he
                            did not mean to imply that he thought the Rights would comeback, and he
                            gave the impression that he thought it quite possible that by then the
                            President will break with the Socialists and try to create a center
                            basis for his government.</p>
                        <p>I was particularly interested in Walker’s estimate of Schnake, the
                            Socialist leader, now Minister of Fomento, after having been the
                            Socialist leader in the Senate. Walker describes him as a man of real
                            ability, of fine political judgment, and not nearly so radical as his
                            talk. He says that Grove, the extremist among the Socialists, has lost
                            greatly in prestige and that Schnake is now the power in the Socialist
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>Cruchaga spoke with affection of Washington, of Roosevelt, Hull and
                            yourself and I noticed prominently displayed autographed and inscribed
                            photographs of Roosevelt, Hughes and Kellogg.</p>
                        <p>I got a pleasant impression, after Spain, of the very fine and
                            considerate reception given Ortega who was a guest among his political
                            foes. Such a thing would have been utterly impossible in Spain during my
                            time there before the war. I was also impressed with the sanity and
                            objectivity of the Rightist leaders. In other words, despite the
                            fundamental differences of the parties here, there is an absence in
                            political circles of the fanaticism and hate which made social life in
                            Madrid so trying.</p>
                        <p>There are rumors today that Wachholtz may be made Ambassador to
                            Washington. I hope it is true. I am sure he would greatly like that post
                            and honor. He has a great admiration for the United States because of
                            its organization in business life. He would be most sympathetic in his
                            dealings with us. I greatly regret his resignation which unquestionably
                            is not good.</p>

                                printed.</note> While no one in the Foreign Office has made any
                            comment relative to possible implementation of the American 300-mile
                            neutrality zone, staff officers of the Admiralty who have been working
                            on the problem have taken occasion to express to the Naval Attaché
                            serious concern over the unhealthy effects of certain implementing
                            measures reported to be under consideration.</p>
                        <p>These officers indicated that the British Government had received a
                            definite impression from the highest quarters in Washington that the
                            neutrality zone policy would not be applied in such a way as to hinder
                            the protection of trade. Although the policy had been viewed here with
                            concern from the outset it had been decided on the basis of this
                            impression not to force the issue. The nature of the implementing
                            measures understood to be contemplated however now forced
                            reconsideration of this attitude.</p>
                        <p>From the practical point of view of naval operations, prohibition upon
                            hitherto legitimate fueling in South American ports or from tankers
                            within the 300-mile limit would force British vessels patrolling the
                            South Atlantic to proceed Capetown, Freetown, Trinidad or the Falkland
                            Islands at frequent intervals. Likewise the [denial of] use of South
                            American ports to vessels which had engaged in hostilities within the
                            300-mile limit would require a continuous reshuffling of naval forces
                            over very long distances.</p>
                        <p>It was stated that passing consideration had been given to possible
                            retaliatory measures such as declaring a naval zone around British
                            possessions in the Americas or economic pressure upon South American
                            states but that their government had discarded all idea of retaliation
                            and would be very loath to take any steps which might react unfavorably
                            upon United States public opinion. These officers intimated that the
                            British Government’s reply to the note of the American Republics might
                            indicate willingness not to make an issue of the zone provided
                            assurances were given that Germany would be effectively prevented from
                            commerce raiding within the zone. They indicated, however, that any
                            further German raiding within it would force the end of whatever British
                            acquiescence there might be to the policy. They also referred to the
                            possibility that establishment of the principle of a 300-mile zone might
                            at some future time prove embarrassing to the United States Navy.</p>

                        <p>The concern with which implementation of the policy is regarded here is
                            indicated in articles appearing yesterday in the <hi rend="italic">Daily

                            that the reply will be polite but firm. He continues: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    the legal basis of its existence. There is the breath or a

                                    ships which have committed warlike acts in the area ‘from

                                    stress of weather or damage has long been admitted, and it was
                                    confirmed in The Hague Convention of 1907. Internment has been
                                    ordered only when warships sought to refit themselves not for
                                    sailing but for fighting.</p>

                                    entered an American port in a damaged state, the law would be
                                    set aside if they were immediately interned.</p>

                                    this war, which we deplore as much as they, far from their
                                    shores. The safety of the seas anywhere is in our interest, but

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram No. 216 of
                            December 5, 1939, and despatch No. 191 of December 5, 1939,<note n="7" xml:id="d174fn7">Neither printed.</note> I have the honor to
                            transmit herewith the Spanish text and a translation of the formal
                            communication delivered by Señor Abraham Ortega, Chilean Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs on December 6, 1939, to the diplomatic representatives
                            in Chile of Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru in reply to their
                            suggestion that Chile associate herself with a protest against Russia’s
                            attack upon Finland. This statement was officially delivered to the
                            press; and is to the effect, as the Department will note, that Chile
                            must remain aloof from European affairs. Its reception by the press has
                            been diverse, but on the whole not very favorable.</p>
                        <p>Favorable comment has been made, on the one hand, not only by <hi rend="italic">La Hora</hi> but also by the important <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio. La Hora</hi> speaks of it as one of the
                            most important developments in Chilean foreign policy which has appeared
                            in recent years, and urges that an attitude of detachment from
                            extra-American affairs should always be maintained by this country. <hi rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> refers to it as logical and
                            dignified, since Chile preferably “should take refuge in her
                            Americanism, and show the modesty which becomes her lack of power”. <hi rend="italic">El Frente Popular</hi>, the Communist sheet, of course
                            adopts a laudatory attitude in view of its attachment to Russia.</p>
                        <p>Adverse comment, on the other hand, has been voiced not only by <hi rend="italic">El Imparcial</hi> and <hi rend="italic">El Diario
                                Ilustrado</hi>, but also by the Government’s own <hi rend="italic">La Nación;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Critica, La Opinión</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">El Trabajo</hi>, which usually support the
                            Administration in such matters, have maintained a silence which may
                            appear significant. <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi> makes the point
                            that previous aggressions in Europe have been by countries opposed to
                            popular government while Russia has hitherto been considered by the
                            elements now in power here as one of the democratic powers. It also
                            alludes to the fact that the other countries of America have in the
                            present instance taken a line which will leave Chile isolated. <hi rend="italic">El Imparcial</hi> adverts to the danger implicit in
                            the failure of any small <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0139"/>nation
                            to protest against aggression on another small nation, and feels that
                            Chile’s attitude regarding Spain shows that she does not inevitably keep
                            away from European questions involving international principles
                            affecting the entire community of the world’s nations. Similar ideas
                            have been emitted on the floor of Congress by the Democratic Senator
                            Morales and the Conservative Youth (liberalistic) Deputy Boizard.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with a member of my staff the Foreign Minister stressed
                            the inability of Chile to understand the hidden currents in Europe which
                            may underlie the Finnish situation. The interest of the Communist Party
                            here, which is one of the important assets of the Administration, he
                            said had hot figured at all in his decision. He showed great firmness in
                            his determination to maintain this decision, a firmness which may
                            perhaps be intensified by the criticisms to which it is being
                            subjected.</p>

                                    <p>“That, consequently, it is the desire of the Government of
                                        Chile to give preference to inter-American relations and, at
                                        the same time, to conserve its ties of friendship with the
                                        other nations of the world, avoiding any entanglement in
                                        European complications.</p>

                                    <p>“That, accordingly, the Government of Chile has decreed its
                                        neutrality in the present European conflict and has
                                        carefully refrained from expressing opinions on situations
                                        or acts of a political character arising from the conflict
                                        in question and, furthermore, has made manifest its desire
                                        to continue with the nations now at war the same ties of
                                        friendship as before the conflict.</p>
                                    <p>“That this policy was followed by the Chilean representatives
                                        at the Consultation of Foreign Ministers recently held in
                                        Panama, at which meeting, moreover, there was made manifest
                                        the will of the countries of America to keep entirely apart
                                        from the European conflict, and to try to avoid all
                                        questions which might imply pre-belligerency.</p>
                                    <p>“That, at the request of the Government of Finland, the
                                        Council and Assembly of the League of Nations have been
                                        convoked for the 9th and 11th of this month to discuss the
                                        situation which has arisen between that Government and the
                                        Soviet Union, and at these meetings the European parties
                                        most directly interested will participate.</p>
                                    <p>“That the Government of Chile considers that the pacts,
                                        accords and resolutions which it has signed in America are
                                        designed to embrace American situations and interests, and
                                        that in this sense Chile has been and will always be
                                        disposed to maintain its traditional policy of the most
                                        scrupulous respect for those provisions.</p>
                                    <p>“That, although the Chilean Government regrets the situation
                                        which has arisen with respect to Finland, inasmuch as she
                                        made no joint declaration in the cases of Austria,
                                        Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Baltic countries, she feels
                                        that in the present case, following that same policy, she
                                        should refrain from expressing opinions.”</p>

                            it is communicated to me that Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican
                            Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua
                            have replied that they are in full agreement with the idea launched by
                            Ecuador and adopted by the Panamanian Foreign Office, of formulating a
                            Pan American declaration or protest against the violation of the
                            neutrality of Finland and the invasion of her territory on the part of
                            the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The replies of Haiti, Peru,
                            Chile, the United States and Uruguay only have not been received.</p>
                        <p>With the new adherences, the number of American nations supporting the

                        <p>Consequently my Government considers that the time has come for giving
                            shape to this continental desire to formulate a collective Declaration

                        <p>I desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency’s telegram of December
                            6, 1939, in which reference is made to Section 4 of Resolution 10
                            adopted at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the American
                            Republics regarding “the invasion of weak nations as an expedient for
                            the prosecution and winning of wars” and in which you undertake to rouse
                            all the American Republics to protest against the invasion and
                            occupation of Finland.</p>
                        <p>Consonant with the spirit which motivated President Roosevelt in the
                            issuance of his statement of December 1 condemning the Soviet resort to
                            military force against Finland, this Government is prepared to associate
                            itself with the governments of the other American republics in a joint
                            statement of vigorous protest against the invasion of Finland.</p>

                        <p>120. Your 150, December 9, 1 p.m. The following message has been sent to
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of telegram of December 12 to the Panamanian Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs, printed <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>It is desired that you find early opportunity discreetly to inform Dr.
                            Garay that it would seem preferable that concurrence in the statement be
                            arranged by direct communication of Panama with the other American
                            Governments on the basis of the text which he might draw up. In as much
                            as the Pan American Union has never been granted political functions it
                            would not seem proper to trust to the Governing Board the drafting of or
                            action upon the proposed statement.</p>

                            such a statement, after recalling that the President of the United

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch No. 198 of
                            December 9, 1939, I have the honor to report that the declaration of the
                            Chilean Foreign Minister <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0143"/>with
                            regard to the Russian attack on Finland has aroused active criticism in
                            both houses of the Chilean Congress, but that no change is contemplated
                            in the attitude of the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>In the House of Representatives at least two secret sessions have been
                            held to discuss the attitude of the Foreign Office toward the
                            Russo-Finnish situation, and the Foreign Minister has appeared to
                            explain his policy. The motion introduced by the representative of the
                            Conservative Youth Movement, Deputy Boizard, is still pending, but there
                            seems to be a probability that it may remain dormant.</p>
                        <p>In the Senate the criticism has been even more acute, and on the 12th
                            instant a motion was passed to send a resolution of sympathy to the
                            Finnish Senate declaring the “solidarity” of the Chilean Congress
                            “against the invasion of Finland by the Soviet Union”. According to the
                            press the only vote cast against this motion was by the Communist
                            Senator, Lafferte. The Radical Senators, members of the President’s own
                            party, abstained from voting, but the Socialist Senators voted for the
                            motion and thus disapproved the Government’s attitude.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, however, on the 15th instant, at a joint meeting of the
                            Foreign Affairs Committees of the House and Senate, the Foreign Minister
                            again discussed the question in detail, in confidence, and the session
                            issued the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In a joint meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with
                                    several members of Congress, after a tentative examination of
                                    the facts and documents as to the guidance of the foreign policy
                                    of Chile, especially with regard to the question of Russia and
                                    Finland and of the neutrality of American countries, those
                                    present took cognizance of the ideas and action of the
                                    Government, inspired exclusively by the superior national
                                    interest in maintaining its neutrality, without any relation to
                                    the Communist Party or with any other particular party.</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">There are grounds for regarding this as terminating the
                            discussions, at least for the time being; although on its face it
                            appears to be no more than a recognition that the Government has not
                            been motivated by political considerations. There are statements in this
                            morning’s press that the discussion of the broad issue will be continued
                            in Congress next week, but such discussions will presumably be
                            contingent upon other developments.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the various organs of the press has remained unchanged,
                            the greater part of the criticism coming from the Rightist newspapers.
                            While <hi rend="italic">La Consigna</hi>, which has been regarded as the
                            official organ of the Socialist Party, is against the Government on this
                            point, the attitude of <hi rend="italic">La Opinion</hi>, the rather
                            influential Radical Socialist organ of Rossetti, supports the
                            declaration of December 6th. <hi rend="italic">El Trabajo</hi>, the
                            Vanguardista (Nazi) organ, approves a policy of absolute neutrality, but
                            finds the official declaration illogical and <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0144"/>unconvincing. <hi rend="italic">La Hora</hi> has left
                            the question severely alone, but in a semi-editorial letter asserts that
                            any declaration in favor of Finland would violate Chile’s pledges at the
                            Panama Conference to observe entire neutrality.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with the Foreign Minister last evening he informed me
                            that he and his Government are wholly resolved to maintain their
                            position, as he feels that Chile’s interest, as well as the interest of
                            the American Republics in general, lies in abstaining from entanglements
                            in European affairs.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Silva<note n="10" xml:id="d180fn10">Abelardo Silva, First Secretary
                                of the Chilean Embassy.</note> telephoned during the day that the
                            Ambassador had requested him to get in touch with me following the
                            receipt of a telegram from the Foreign Office at Santiago relating to
                            the proposed declaration condemning the Soviet invasion and occupation
                            of Finland. The telegram said that the Chilean Government was determined
                            to stand fast in its point of view because of the attitude towards
                            Russia manifested hi Geneva of certain of the European neutrals such as
                            the Baltic countries with a more direct interest in the situation
                            between the Soviet Union and Finland than any of the American countries;
                            moreover, because certain of the other American countries had indicated
                            that they shared at least to a certain degree the Chilean point of view.
                            The Ambassador requested Mr. Silva to ascertain what the attitude of the
                            United States would be under these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I informed Mr. Silva that our attitude was perfectly clear, namely, that
                            this Government was prepared to proceed with the other American
                            Governments in the issuance of a declaration condemning the Soviet
                            invasion of Finland. I again recalled to him that this country had
                            already taken that step unilaterally in the issuance by the President of
                            a statement on December 1. Our attitude remained, therefore, that this
                            Government was ready to go ahead with the collective declaration, but
                            was not taking any initiative in the matter.</p>

                        <p>161. Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 120, December 12, noon.
                            Panamanian Minister for Foreign Affairs proposes that he telegraph the

                                    this Chancery at the initiative of the Republic of Ecuador with
                                    a view to the formulation of a collective American protest
                                    against the aggression of which the Republic of Finland has been
                                    the object on the part of the Union of Soviet Socialist

                                    Excellency that 20 American republics including those of Ecuador
                                    and Panama have agreed to apply the principles laid down in
                                    resolution No. 10 of the recent consultative meeting of Panama
                                    over which I had the honor to preside, to condemn unanimously
                                    and with the greatest energy the resort to force which a great

                                    with a small nation, jealous of its independence and

                        <p>With respect to the suggested message to the Minister of Foreign
                            Relations of Finland, as suggested by Dr. Garay, Secretary of Foreign
                            Relations of Panama, it would seem advisable to delay a day or so prior
                            to indicating the Department’s comments or views.</p>
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0146"/>
                        <p>It will be noted that the Government of Chile is not included among those
                            that have responded favorably to the suggestion made by the President of
                            Panama that the Soviet invasion of Finland be condemned. The Chilean
                            Government has circularized all of its diplomatic missions instructing
                            them to clarify before the governments to which they are accredited the
                            reasons why Chile has not seen fit to join in this initiative. The
                            result of this action of Chile may be to cause certain defections among
                            the countries that have already assented. The Ambassador of Brazil
                            informed me yesterday that he had received word from his Government that
                            it would not join in the <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> unless there is
                            unanimity. The Chilean circular telegram also indicated that Mexico and
                            Peru were lukewarm to the idea.</p>
                        <p>It would therefore be my suggestion that no reply be made to Dr. Garay’s
                            telegram for a day or so or until we know more exactly what the attitude
                            of Brazil and possibly certain other countries is.</p>

                        <p>I thoroughly agree. Furthermore, I think there is nothing less desirable
                            at this juncture than to give the impression to the rest of the world
                            that the American Republics are not united in all questions of policy,
                            and the message suggested by Dr. Garay would make it perfectly clear
                            that the proposed declaration was not supported unanimously.</p>
                        <p>My own judgment is that unless Chile changes her mind, which I suppose is
                            doubtful, it would be better to issue no declaration. You may remember
                            that in my first reply to the Government of Ecuador I stated that we
                            would be glad to join if <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the other
                            American Republics likewise joined.</p>

                        <p>125. Your No. 161, December 19, 3 p.m. Please inform Dr. Garay that the
                            Department, while in full agreement with the text of the proposed
                            message to Helsinki, is strongly of the opinion that such a message
                            should only be sent in the name of all of the 21 American republics, and
                            that the consequences of action in which one or more of these republics
                            does not participate might be detrimental to the development <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0147"/>of that spirit of continental
                            solidarity which has been so valuable to all the American Republics in
                            facing the problems created by the current world situation. Furthermore,
                            in this particular case, the governments of a number of the American
                            republics, including the Government of the United States, have given
                            adequate expression to their protest against the aggression of which the
                            Republic of Finland has been the object on the part of the Soviet Union.
                            It would seem, therefore, that the opportune moment for collective
                            action in this case has passed. You should take this opportunity of
                            expressing my personal appreciation and that of the Under Secretary for
                            the splendid services which Dr. Garay has rendered the American
                            republics since the close of the Panama meeting.</p>

                        <p>167. Department’s telegram No. 125 of December 27, 5 p.m. The Panamanian
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs has just told me that Chile persists in its
                            refusal and that through the Ecuadoran Minister here he has consulted
                            the Ecuadoran Government concerning its wishes as to whether the matter
                            should be dropped or the message should be sent to Helsinki on behalf of
                            the 20 republics which have approved.</p>
                        <p>He says that since the aggression continues he does not feel that the
                            opportune moment for a protest has passed but that he does recognize the
                            great desirability of unanimous action. He says that while he has no
                            personal interest in the matter he feels that as intermediary he cannot
                            [refuse?] it if Ecuador as sponsor and the other governments which have
                            approved the action desire that the message be sent. The Department may
                            wish to make its views known to the Government of Ecuador. If Ecuador
                            requests Garay to send the message he will wish to know whether the
                            United States is to be included and I should appreciate the Department’s
                            instruction on the point.</p>

                        <p>126. Your 167, December 30, noon. Our acceptance of the Ecuadorian
                            initiative as well as the Panamanian draft was contingent upon adoption
                            by all the American Republics. For the reasons indicated in <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0148"/>Department’s telegram No. 125 we are,
                            however, strongly of the opinion that in the absence of unanimity it
                            would be better to abandon the project.</p>
                        <p>In expressing renewed appreciation to Doctor Garay you will therefore
                            please explain that, inasmuch as the proposal does not appear to have
                            been accepted by all of the American nations, we would be unable to
                            subscribe thereto.</p>
                        <p>We shall take occasion tomorrow again to explain our position to the
                            Ecuadorian Ambassador.</p>

                                as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>President Benavides has a sincere desire to settle the
                                        boundary controversy; Peru cannot accept however the
                                        two-point formula proposed by Dr. Tobar Donoso for renewal
                                        of negotiations followed by mediation if the negotiations do
                                        not reach a satisfactory result within a stipulated period;
                                        nor can Peru accept an alternative proposal recently
                                        advanced by Dr. Tobar Donoso that two friendly countries
                                        such as the United States and Brazil, make a careful
                                        independent study of the boundary problem for the purpose of
                                        informing themselves during the period that direct
                                        negotiations are being carried out; nor will Peru agree to
                                        resume direct negotiations in Washington or Rio; however,
                                        Peru is ready at any time to resume direct discussion in
                                        Lima and is prepared to state formally, but apparently not
                                        in writing, to some friendly third country that if the
                                        negotiations fail to reach a satisfactory conclusion Peru
                                        will then invoke one of the conciliation instruments to
                                        which both Ecuador and Peru are parties.</p>
                                    <p>The Ecuadorans profess to see no value in the Peruvian
                                        counterproposal claiming that under the conciliation
                                        treaties Ecuador could invoke at this moment the
                                        conciliation procedure on the ground that direct
                                        negotiations have been exhausted and secondly that the
                                        conciliation procedure will not advance a solution since the
                                        non-national members of the committee of investigation would
                                        sit as individuals and not as agents of government.</p>

                                opinion regarding the situation. My own judgment is that if Dr.

                                controversy should not prove successful, Peru would then be willing
                                to invoke one of the conciliation instruments to which both Ecuador
                                and Peru are parties and which instrument is satisfactory to the
                                Government of Ecuador, an agreement on the part of Peru to accept
                                mediation in the event that direct negotiations prove unsuccessful
                                will to all intents and purposes have been obtained. Before

                                he had had a private conversation with President Benavides and was
                                optimistic about finding a solution of the problem. Mello Franco
                                counseled, however, taking no further action for at least one month
                                in order to avoid the impression that pressure had been brought to
                                bear by the <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0151"/>Conference
                                itself. Aranha added that upon Mello Franco’s return here in about
                                one week he will send you a full expose of the situation.</p>

                            <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have been confidentially informed
                                from a reliable source that the Government of Ecuador is actively
                                negotiating with the Government of Brazil to open Ecuadoran-Peruvian
                                boundary settlement discussions in Rio de Janeiro. It is said that
                                the Brazilian Foreign Minister views the proposal with sympathy and
                                that Dr. Homero Viteri Lafronte, President of the Ecuadoran
                                Delegation at the Washington negotiations, will be appointed
                                Ecuadoran Minister to Brazil in order to work with the Brazilian
                                Government towards this end. Dr. Viteri Lafronte has requested his
                                Government to send him to Rio de Janeiro via Washington, presumably
                                to obtain the opinion of the United States Government on the
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>In this connection it is observed that Dr. Antonio J. Quevedo,
                                Ecuadoran Minister to London and Geneva has been appointed Minister
                                to Lima. Dr. Quevedo is one of Ecuador’s ablest diplomats and
                                lawyers. He was considered an excellent Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                and is probably the most competent person that could be sent to Lima
                                to try to persuade the Peruvian Government to accept the
                                proposal.</p>
                            <p>Of course, it is feared that Peru will be very reluctant to accept
                                such an invitation. However, the Government of Ecuador appears to be
                                optimistic about this attempt to renew negotiations and is leaving
                                no stone unturned to carry out its plan.</p>

                                killing two. When the Peruvian police returned the fire the
                                Ecuadoran regulars withdrew. Peruvian regulars arrived on the scene
                                but did not participate in the clash, one Peruvian soldier reported

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on
                                July 19th <hi rend="italic">El Comercio</hi> of Quito published a
                                press despatch stating that an incident had taken place on the
                                Ecuadoran-Peruvian frontier between Ecuadoran and Peruvian troops.
                                The incident occurred at 10 o’clock on the morning of July 18th in
                                the Province of El Oro south of a point called Aguas Verdes in the
                                Pocitos region. The press reported that several persons had been
                                killed and wounded.</p>
                            <p>Further details published on July 20th indicated that although no one
                                had been killed or wounded, the Peruvians claimed that Ecuadoran
                                troops had fired on members of the Peruvian Civil Guard, whereas the
                                Ecuadorans stated that they had been fired on first.</p>
                            <p>The Ecuadoran Minister in Lima was instructed to present a formal
                                protest to the Peruvian Government for this violation of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> and invasion of Ecuadoran
                                territory by the Peruvian Army. The Government of Peru likewise
                                instructed its Chargé d’Affaires at Quito to present a protest to
                                the Ecuadoran Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>An official communiqué of the Foreign Office, a translation of which

                                the incident.</p>

                                <p>According to a telegram sent by the Chief of Security of the

                                    morning there occurred an incident between Ecuadorans and
                                    Peruvians a little distance south of the place called Aguas
                                    Verdes, in the region of Pocitos, situated in the jurisdiction
                                    of Huaquillas, at the time when a group of four men from our
                                    garrison was patrolling as usual that region. When the Ecuadoran
                                    picket drew near the Peruvian Civil Guards fired on them and
                                    obliged our soldiers to fire back.</p>
                                <p>The same telegram adds that a verbal agreement has been reached
                                    by the Chief of the Ecuadoran Garrison and Captain Sevilla of
                                    the Peruvian Civil Guard in order to remove from that region the
                                    troops from both sides.</p>
                                <p>Since the Peruvian Foreign Office has made an official statement
                                    in which it declares that the Peruvian Civil Guards have been
                                    the victims of a surprise attack, the Ministry for Foreign
                                    Affairs of Ecuador wants to put on record the fact that
                                    according to information available up to the present time the
                                    attack was made by those Guards and that the Ecuadoran soldiers
                                    have found themselves obliged to repel them.</p>
                                <p>Consequently, the Ecuadoran Minister in Lima has been instructed
                                    to present an appropriate protest and to demand that the
                                    boundary authorities maintain a proper attitude for the benefit
                                    of American peace.</p>
                                <p>The place where the attack took place is in territory which in
                                    fact and right belongs to Ecuador. In fact, the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> boundary is the Zarumilla River,
                                    which has never changed its course, as Peru arbitrarily
                                    maintains in order to claim jurisdiction over the Pocitos
                                    region, which is between the two river beds. Aside from obvious
                                    juridical titles, Ecuador has shown Peru the reports of learned
                                    foreigners such as Messrs. Shepperd and Sauer, who after a
                                    detailed study of the geological formations have arrived at the
                                    conclusion that the Zarumilla River has always flowed over its
                                    present river bed and that the hypothesis of the double river
                                    bed is merely a myth which cannot be held in the light of
                                    science. The report of the foreign geologists agrees with those
                                    of other scientific authorities and with the statements of the
                                    inhabitants of the region.</p>
                                <p>In the hope of a radical solution of the boundary question,
                                    Ecuador has tried to prevent frontier incidents from altering
                                    the atmosphere necessary for that solution in spite of the fact
                                    that in every case the Ecuadorans have been victims of bloody
                                    attacks.</p>
                                <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0154"/>
                                <p>It is therefore surprizing that the Peruvian Foreign Office
                                    instead of following a similar course, and without awaiting a
                                    careful investigation of the facts should have issued an
                                    accusation of attack against Ecuador. But as has been shown such
                                    an attack came from the Peruvian National Guard which had
                                    invaded without right Ecuadoran territory.</p>

                                communiqué. Asserts that Aguas Verdes has always been and continues
                                under Peruvian sovereignty and a police post has always existed at
                                that site. Dismisses as irrelevant Ecuadoran contention referring to
                                geological survey of river beds. Reasserts its version that two
                                Peruvian police were killed. Declares Ecuadoran statements untrue
                                that Peruvian forces have withdrawn from their positions at
                                Zarumilla. Adds that Ecuadoran forces have withdrawn from territory
                                held by Peruvian forces.</p>

                            <p>As the Chancellery of Ecuador has issued and made public a communiqué
                                relative to the occurrences of the morning of the 18th instant in
                                the neighborhood of the Peruvian post situated on the left bank of
                                the Zarumilla River, called “Aguas Verdes”, the Department of
                                Foreign Relations of Peru finds itself obliged to refute it, in view
                                of the inexact statements contained in the text thereof.</p>
                            <p>The Ecuadoran Chancellery affirms, indeed, that “Aguas Verdes”,
                                situated in the region of Pocitos, is under the Ecuadoran
                                jurisdiction of Huaquillas, notwithstanding that Peru has
                                maintained, does maintain and will continue maintaining a post of
                                the Civil Guard with which it exercises effective sovereignty over
                                all that region and in <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0155"/>which Peruvian farmers have always cultivated and still cultivate
                                tobacco. Peru has put all these facts on record in various notes of
                                the Department of Foreign Relations.</p>
                            <p>This discards the possibility that an Ecuadoran patrol “was keeping
                                watch as usual” over those places, as the Ecuadoran communiqué says.
                                In that case, the incident must have occurred long before, because
                                our detachment would not have failed to discharge its duty of
                                enforcing respect for our possession and according protection to the
                                Peruvians established in that sector of the national territory.</p>
                            <p>The allegation of pretended rights on the part of Ecuador to the
                                region included between the two channels of the Zarumilla River, and
                                the arguments of a geological character which are adduced do not
                                justify the penetration of its forces into territory which it
                                perfectly well knows is under the effective dominion of Peru and has
                                been since before the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> of 1936.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of giving an honest appearance to the aggression and
                                eluding responsibility, the Ecuadoran communiqué affirms that there
                                was one killed on each side, suggesting the false idea that a combat
                                was carried on. The inexactitude of this is proved by the personal
                                identity of the two Peruvian casualties, whose burial has just taken
                                place in the Peruvian city of Tumbes.</p>
                            <p>It is likewise inexact that a verbal agreement was reached to remove
                                from the place the troops of both sides. The commander of the
                                Ecuadoran detachment, Yepes, in a conference held on the 15th
                                instant with the captain of the Peruvian Civil Guard, Sevilla,
                                promised that his soldiers would not again cross the boundary.
                                Notwithstanding this, three days afterwards the Ecuadoran forces
                                entered and made a surprise attack on the Peruvian detachment which
                                was patrolling the farm of a colonist, Villadares, being repulsed to
                                the other side of the boundary.</p>
                            <p>After these events and on the request of the Ecuadoran officer
                                mentioned, another meeting was held with Captain Sevilla, in which
                                the former stated that he was ready to withdraw his forces and hoped
                                that the latter would do the same. The Peruvian officer answered
                                that he had no reason to withdraw from the place where he was,
                                inasmuch as he had not advanced from his usual post, and he
                                expressed his determination to remain there.</p>
                            <p>Ecuadoran troops are the only ones who withdrew to their own
                                territory, after having committed a bloody attack. The Peruvian
                                troops remained and will remain at “Aguas Verdes”.</p>

                            <p>31. [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>] Reference Ocheltree’s telegram No. 98,
                                January 6, 11 a.m. The action of the Government of Honduras in
                                rejecting the proposal <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0157"/>of
                                the Boundary Commission for an aerial survey of the Segovia basin is
                                of course regrettable from every point of view but I feel
                                emphatically that it should not be allowed to terminate the efforts
                                of the Commission to reach a solution of the problem. I feel that it
                                is now more imperative than ever that the Commission proceed to
                                carry out the long-projected visits to Managua and Tegucigalpa to
                                confer with the two Presidents and that this should be done without
                                delay. When news of the Honduran action becomes public, we may be
                                confronted with a renewal of tension between the two countries. The
                                visit would emphasize to the public in Honduras and Nicaragua that
                                mediatory efforts have not been abandoned and through direct
                                discussions with President Carías it should be possible to convince
                                him of the desirability of the aerial survey as a preliminary step
                                which would facilitate an ultimate solution.</p>
                            <p>Please consult with the other members of the Commission at once with
                                regard to the visit and inform me of developments. It is hoped that
                                at least one of the other members can accompany you as it would not
                                be desirable for you to go alone.</p>

                                Montúfar will be opposed to such a visit and if made by us only will
                                create friction with the Costa Rican Government.</p>

                                    present is for the representatives of Costa Rica and Venezuela
                                    in Washington to try all possible means with the Department of
                                    State to persuade the Government of Honduras of the advisablity
                                    of accepting the plan of mediation which is now being discussed.
                                    In this way he considers that the Governments of Venezuela and
                                    the United States would not expose themselves to the possibility
                                    of being in an equivocal position in the event that the visit to
                                    the two capitals should prove ineffective. He considers that as
                                    you will soon be in Caracas a final decision can then be reached

                                discussions with the Honduran diplomatic representative in
                                Washington, <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0159"/>as suggested by
                                Doctor Rodríguez, would be of value in inducing the Honduran

                                Carías. If Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar should for any reason be unable or
                                unwilling to proceed to Managua and Tegucigalpa in the near future,
                                it is greatly to be hoped that he will give his support to having
                                the visits carried out by you and Dr. Rodríguez.</p>

                            <p>8. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 4 of January 18. Under
                                the present circumstances it is unlikely that Doctor Rodríguez or
                                his Government would agree to proposed visits unless accompanied by
                                Zúñiga Montúfar or some other Costa Rican representative. Zúñiga
                                Montúfar, now traveling in South America, has not yet answered my
                                telegram of January 9.<note n="17" xml:id="d202fn17">See telegram
                                    No. 2, January 9, 2 a.m., from the Representative of the
                                    President, <ref target="#pg_149">p. 149</ref>.</note> When his
                                reply is received, if the Department perceives no objection, I would
                                like to suggest to him and Rodríguez a meeting of the commission in
                                Panama coincident with the date of his return here with the object
                                of determining a plan of procedure in line with Department’s
                                instructions.</p>
                            <p>I am in complete agreement with the Department’s view that the best
                                hope of prevailing upon the Honduran Government to modify its views
                                would be through the effective method of personal conversations
                                between the members of the commission and President Carías. However,
                                in view of the danger that delay and difficulties in getting the
                                commission together and securing their agreement to the program may
                                lose us the advantage of the present dry season (the only time of
                                the year in which aerial reconnaissance is possible) and since
                                according to my information there is division amongst President
                                Carías’ advisers I have a strong feeling that other efforts to
                                modify the Honduran Government’s ill-advised decision should be
                                continued by means of all possible channels.</p>

                                to the delicate status of negotiations which he is conducting with
                                the Colombian Government or to visit the disputant countries “even

                            <p>15. At a conference in the Legation this afternoon the President of
                                the Commission drafted a note for the Honduran Government. The note
                                gives assurance that no juridical question is involved and again
                                asks for cooperation in making the necessary geographic studies. I
                                agreed to the general tenor of the note which will be submitted to
                                the Venezuelan member before being despatched by Zúñiga Montúfar
                                after his return to Costa Rica tomorrow.</p>

                                Zúñiga Montúfar and I discussed the advisability of having the note

                                Permanent Secretariat. I am inclined to favor this as he could
                                informally explain the technical features of the matter with a view
                                to allaying Honduran objections to the aerial reconnaissance.</p>

                            <p>20. Referring to the Department’s No. 11, February 8, 4 p.m. There is
                                no possibility that Zúñiga Montúfar would accompany me to Honduras
                                and Nicaragua without Dr. Rodríguez and no possibility that the
                                Venezuelan member can be persuaded to make the visits while Honduras

                            <p>23. Your telegram no. 29, March 20, 4 p.m. It is believed that for
                                obvious reasons the exposition of the point of view of the
                                Commission with regard to the desirability of carrying out the
                                proposed aerial survey could be presented to the Honduran Government
                                much more effectively by you and Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar than by
                                Ocheltree acting alone. I am confident that if Dr. Rodríguez should
                                be unable to accompany you he would not interpose any objection to a
                                visit to Tegucigalpa by you and Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar. I suggest
                                therefore for this purpose as well as for the reasons outlined in
                                the Department’s telegrams no. 1 of January 7, 3 p.m. and no. 4 of
                                January 18, 6 p.m. that you sound out Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar on the
                                question of making the visit with the least possible delay. If he is
                                not able to make the visit with you, consideration can then be given
                                to the suggested visit to Tegucigalpa by Ocheltree for technical
                                discussions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
                            <p>I believe that the meeting of the Commission suggested in your
                                despatch no. 683 of March 16,<note n="24" xml:id="d215fn24">Not
                                    printed.</note> could be held more advantageously after the
                                visit to Tegucigalpa by you and Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar when the
                                attitude of the Honduran Government toward the future work of the
                                Commission would presumably have been clarified. However, in order
                                to avoid any misunderstanding, it is believed that the meeting
                                should be held in San José.</p>
                            <p>Please refer to Ocheltree’s despatch no. 113 of March 15,<note n="24" xml:id="d215fn1">Not printed.</note> page 2, reporting Dr.
                                Zúñiga Montúfar’s statement that the decision to request the
                                Honduran Government to reconsider its stand on the aerial survey had
                                been made on the basis of assurances given to the Department by the
                                Honduran Chargé d’Affaires in Washington that the request would
                                receive favorable consideration. You are requested to inform Dr.
                                Zúñiga Montúfar either directly or through Ocheltree that no such
                                assurances have been given to the Department. You may wish to inform
                                Ocheltree of the foregoing.</p>

                            <p>34. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 26, April 6, 4
                                    p.m.<note n="25" xml:id="d217fn25">Not printed; it inquired
                                    regarding Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar’s attitude (715.1715/1411).</note>
                                Zúñiga Montúfar is opposed to visiting Tegucigalpa with me at this
                                time. He is definitely of the opinion that the Commission has to
                                meet at San José before further action of any kind can be taken. The
                                question of visits would have to be taken up by the Commission at
                                its meeting. He wants to deal “categorically” formally with the
                                question of the meeting by addressing letters to Dr. Rodríguez and
                                myself inquiring when it would be convenient to come to San José.
                                For us this would be a formality since our readiness to convene has
                                been made clear, see <ref target="#pg_10">page 10</ref> Legation’s
                                despatch No. 683, March 16,<note n="26" xml:id="d217fn26">Not
                                    printed.</note> but the procedure which he contemplates does not
                                take into account Rodríguez’s views as expressed. The next move must
                                depend upon the attitude of the Venezuelan representative. Panama
                                was only suggested as a place of meeting with the idea that it would
                                be easier to get Rodríguez to come here than to San José.</p>

                            <p>27. Your telegrams No. 34, April 7, 11 a.m., and No. 35, April 8, 3
                                p.m. It is believed that the proposed meeting of the Commission in
                                San José might serve the purpose of clarifying the course of the
                                mediation for the near future and would moreover constitute an
                                indication that the mediation has not been abandoned. However, it is
                                believed that the meeting should not be permitted to result in any
                                categorical action which would tend to place responsibility for the
                                continuance of mediation on either of the parties to the dispute.
                                Experience has shown, as exemplified recently in the final
                                settlement of the Chaco controversy,<note n="27" xml:id="d219fn27">See <ref target="frus1938v05#pg_89">

                                patience on the part of the mediators over a long period of time can
                                lead to successful termination of difficulties which at times may
                                appear insurmountable. It is my opinion that the members of the
                                Commission should continue to be guided in their efforts by these
                                considerations.</p>

                            <p>38. Referring Legation’s telegram No. 34, April 7 and No. 35 of April
                                8, on April 12 the President of Mediation Commission sent a telegram
                                in clear to the Venezuelan member indicating my agreement that the
                                Commission should meet at San José to discuss pending questions and
                                requesting him to indicate the earliest date when he could meet in
                                order “to communicate it to the foreign Governments of Honduras and
                                Nicaragua”. On April 15 Dr. Rodríguez acknowledged receipt of this
                                telegram stating that he had referred it to his Government.</p>
                            <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0167"/>
                            <p>Zúñiga Montúfar explained to Ocheltree that he had not used wording
                                suggested by me as Rodríguez might seek a way out. The wording used
                                apparently contemplates plenary sessions with the delegations
                                instead of an executive meeting of the Commission only.</p>
                            <p>This would be, in my opinion, inadvisable until after proposed visit
                                to Tegucigalpa.</p>

                            <p>31. Your telegram 38, April 16, 2 p.m. It has been our understanding
                                that it was the intention of Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar to arrange an
                                informal meeting of the Commission, without the presence of the
                                representatives of the disputant parties, primarily for the purpose
                                of deciding on the most suitable procedure to obtain the agreement
                                of the Government of Honduras to the carrying out of aerial
                                photographic surveys. It was also understood that the meeting was
                                intended to prepare the ground for visits by members of the
                                Commission to Tegucigalpa and possibly Managua.</p>
                            <p>The necessity for the presence at this time of representatives of
                                Honduras and Nicaragua is not apparent. On the contrary it is
                                believed that the calling of “plenary sessions” in the absence of a
                                very definite understanding with regard to the program to be
                                followed would only result in confusion and might tend to impede the
                                course of the mediation.</p>
                            <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0168"/>
                            <p>While it is not desired to take a categorical stand on this question,
                                it is suggested that you may consider it desirable to communicate
                                informally with Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar in the sense of the foregoing
                                observations.</p>

                                said that in his last conversation with the President the latter had
                                expressed his urgent desire to visit Venezuela once more and that he
                                hoped that his program would make it possible for him to make such a
                                visit before long. The Ambassador told me that he had communicated
                                this statement of the President to President López-Contreras and
                                that he had now received a message from his President <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0169"/>saying that nothing would give the

                                than to have the President visit Venezuela and that he earnestly
                                hoped that the President would find it possible to make such a visit
                                in the near future. I told the Ambassador that I would be happy to
                                transmit this message to the President.</p>

                                of talking with the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister and that Dr. Cordero
                                Reyes had expressed the feeling of the Nicaraguan Government that
                                the mediation proceedings between Nicaragua and Honduras were
                                dragging on in a very unsatisfactory way and asked whether it would
                                not be possible for negotiations to be resumed and expedited. The
                                Ambassador said that of course, as I knew, certain difficulties had
                                now arisen because of the bad feeling which existed between the
                                Venezuelan and Costa Rican Foreign Offices as a result of the
                                failure of Costa Rica at the Lima Conference to abide by the
                                assurances which it had given Venezuela to support Caracas as the
                                seat for the next inter-American conference. The Ambassador said
                                that as a result of this incident the Venezuelan Legation in Central
                                America had been moved from Costa Rica to Guatemala and the
                                Venezuelan representative on the Mediation Commission, Dr.
                                Rodríguez, had been told not to attend the meeting of the Mediation
                                Commission were such meeting to be held in San José. The Ambassador
                                further said that when Dr. Rodríguez and Dr. Corrigan had expressed
                                their desire to have a meeting of the Mediation Commission held in
                                Panama, the Costa Rican Foreign Minister had refused to attend the
                                meeting in that city on the pretext that until the boundary incident
                                between Panama and Costa Rica had been settled he could not
                                appropriately visit Panama.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then inquired what my feeling in the matter might be.
                                I said that in the first place I deeply regretted to learn of the
                                friction which had arisen between the Venezuelan and Costa Rican
                                Foreign Offices and that if there were anything this Government
                                could do to smooth matters over in order that the misunderstanding
                                might be eliminated, we would be only too happy to do what we could
                                in the matter. The Ambassador seemed much pleased with this
                                suggestion and said that he would communicate with his Foreign
                                Minister, Dr. Gil Borges, and advise me of the latter’s feeling with
                                regard thereto.</p>
                            <p>I then said that with regard to the procedure of the Mediation
                                Commission I had myself talked at some length with President Somoza
                                and Dr. Cordero Reyes and had obtained the very definite impression
                                that President Somoza felt that when he visited Honduras next month
                                some basis for an agreement between the two countries might arise
                                from his personal conversations with President Carias and it seemed
                                consequently that we might let matters rest until we learned whether
                                these conversations gave any ground for optimism as to the finding
                                    <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0170"/>of a solution. I said
                                that it seemed to me that immediately thereafter the members of the
                                Mediation Commission should have a meeting and that I hoped they
                                then would agree to make personal visits to Managua and Tegucigalpa
                                which I had always believed was the proper procedure to follow. The
                                Ambassador then inquired whether this Government would be willing to
                                have a meeting of the Mediation Commission held in Washington. I
                                said that of course in principle the hospitality of this Government
                                was always available for meetings of this kind which were intended
                                to find solutions by pacific methods of difficulties arising between
                                the various American republics, but that in this case I thought it
                                would be very unwise for such a suggestion to be made unless the
                                Government of Costa Rica sincerely desired that such a step be taken
                                and officially advised us that they desired that a meeting be held
                                in Washington. I said I knew by experience that Costa Rica was very
                                jealous of her prestige in having her own capital the seat for the
                                mediation conferences and that I thought it would be inexpedient for
                                this Government to give any indication with regard to its
                                willingness to have Washington as the seat of the next meeting until
                                and unless Costa Rica informed us that she so desired. The
                                Ambassador said he understood this situation fully and thought we
                                had better await the results of President Somoza’s visit to Honduras
                                before deciding anything further.</p>
                            <p>As he left the Ambassador again urged that the experts desired by the
                                Venezuelan Government for customs and related questions be selected
                                and sent to Venezuela without further delay. He said that the
                                Venezuelan Congress adjourned the 4th of July and that as he had
                                told me before it was indispensable that these experts be selected
                                and if possible be present in Venezuela before that date. I told the
                                Ambassador I would look into the matter at once and do what I could
                                to expedite a solution.</p>

                            <p>46. Your telegrams No. 53, May 19, 11 a.m., and No. 55, May 22, 4
                                p.m. In view of reports that President Somoza intends to visit
                                Tegucigalpa in order to discuss with President Carías a possible
                                solution of the boundary problem, I do not consider it wise for the
                                Commission or Mr. Ocheltree to take any action at this time.
                                Ocheltree’s proposed visit to Tegucigalpa should therefore be
                                deferred.</p>
                            <p>I think that the Commission should bear in mind the possibility of
                                carrying out the visit following the conversation between the two
                                presidents if it then appears that the visit should be

                            <p>43. We are of course greatly interested in learning of the results of

                                regarding the boundary situation. If you have not already done so,
                                kindly take an early opportunity to inquire informally of President
                                Somoza and submit a telegraphic report.</p>

                            <p>72. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 43, July 6, 7 p.m. In
                                informal conversation yesterday Somoza stated that he had discussed
                                    <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0173"/>the question with both
                                    Ubico<note n="32" xml:id="d231fn32">Jorgé Ubico, President of
                                    Guatemala.</note> and Martinez<note n="33" xml:id="d231fn33">Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, President of El
                                    Salvador.</note> and obtained from each a guarantee that he
                                would protect his own boundary with Honduras and that no
                                revolutionary anti-Honduran troubles would originate in his own
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Somoza said he knew that Carías was responsible for the lack of
                                attention in the Honduran press to his visit and just prior to his
                                arrival had repeatedly published the laudo<note n="34" xml:id="d231fn34">Award of December 23, 1906, <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State Papers</hi>, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi>, p. 1096.</note> to induce the
                                Honduran citizen to recognize no other stand. During the visit
                                Carías had apparently avoided offering an opportunity to discuss the
                                boundary question but Somoza seized the occasion to discuss it fully
                                with him at the Government banquet. Carías said at once that
                                Honduras stood by the laudo. Somoza stated to him that the
                                Nicaraguan postage stamp had answered Honduran but had not asserted
                                territorial claim in the same manner that both Ubico and Martinez
                                gave guarantees above to which he added Nicaragua.<note n="34a" xml:id="d231fn34a">Sentence apparently garbled in
                                    transmission.</note> He promised the President of Honduras that
                                Nicaragua would not make war on its neighbors. (He amended this
                                later in the same conversation reiterating what he has frequently
                                said to me by adding “unless Honduras provokes us”) The award of the
                                Commission, Somoza said to Carías, would doubtless be such as to
                                give neither country all it claimed. It might be necessary for
                                Nicaragua to accept less than it claimed and for Honduras to do the
                                same.</p>
                            <p>Somoza says that Carías merely replied that perhaps some acceptable
                                settlement could be reached but did not commit himself nor repeat
                                his earlier reference to laudo. Somoza feels that Carías fears for
                                his ability to retain office and is inaccessible to informed
                                advisers. His opinion of Carías appears not to have changed since my
                                personal letter of August 19, 1938<note n="35" xml:id="d231fn35">Not
                                    found in Department files.</note> to Mr. Duggan reporting a
                                conversation with Somoza on the boundary question. To my direct
                                question in yesterday’s conversation Somoza replied unequivocally
                                that he supports the Mediation Commission and is prepared to accept
                                its decision.</p>
                            <p>Somoza will inform the Under Secretary fully through his Minister of
                                his interview with Carías.</p>
                            <p>He plans to visit Costa Rica at some time as yet undetermined and
                                will discuss this question fully when there.</p>

                            <p>9. For Corrigan. Before leaving San José the President of the
                                Commission furnished me with a letter to the Honduran Foreign
                                Minister and notified him by telegram of my expected arrival. He
                                also explained the purpose of the visit to the Minister of Nicaragua
                                at San José.</p>
                            <p>At the airport at Managua Dr. Cordero Reyes said he was writing an
                                air mail letter to the Under Secretary regarding President Somoza’s
                                visit to Tegucigalpa. Dr. Cordero Reyes stated that it had always
                                been his opinion that the boundary question with Honduras could not
                                be settled by bilateral action and that the recent visit of the
                                President of Nicaragua to Tegucigalpa had confirmed this
                                opinion.</p>
                            <p>In an interview this morning with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
                                Honduras he said that President Carías would give me an opportunity
                                to present the geographic data on Monday at an hour to be indicated
                                later.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Cáceres, newly appointed Minister of Honduras, called to see me
                                today to present his respects in his new capacity. I told him what
                                great pleasure it gave me to welcome such an old friend, who had
                                been in Washington for so many years, as Minister of his
                                country.</p>
                            <p>I asked Dr. Cáceres if he had any information with regard to the
                                boundary dispute between his country and Nicaragua because I
                                wondered whether he felt that any satisfactory progress had been
                                made during the course of the visit to Tegucigalpa in conversations
                                between the President of Nicaragua and the President of Honduras.
                                Dr. Cáceres professed complete ignorance of what might have
                                transpired in those conversations. He said, however, that he
                                believed from communications that he had received from his
                                Government that any formula for a solution that might be proposed,
                                provided it evaded the difficulty of declaring void the arbitral
                                award of the King of Spain, would offer a ground for solution not
                                unacceptable in principle to his <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0177"/>Government. I asked the Minister who in his opinion
                                was really in charge, on behalf of his Government, of these boundary
                                negotiations. He told me that while Señor Lainez had a good deal to
                                say about it, he nevertheless believed that the final authority was
                                the present Foreign Minister, Señor Aguirre. I told the Minister
                                that I hoped he and his Government would bear in mind the fact that
                                this Government was always ready to do whatever it could, provided
                                both Nicaragua and Honduras so desired, to facilitate a friendly
                                solution and that we were gladly continuing our participation in the
                                Mediation Commission with the hope that the Commission might prove
                                successful in assisting the two Governments in reaching a final and
                                equitable adjustment of the controversy.</p>

                            <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Don
                                José Augusto Padilla, the Honduran engineer who was a technical
                                adviser to the Honduran delegation to the San José Mediation
                                Conference and who is now permanently employed in an advisory
                                capacity in the Foreign Office, called voluntarily at the Legation a
                                few days ago and had a brief conversation with me.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Padilla spoke principally about the recent visit to Tegucigalpa
                                of Mr. John B. Ocheltree, the Secretary of the American member of
                                the Mediation Commission. As the Department is aware, Mr. Ocheltree
                                visited Tegucigalpa during the middle of July for the purpose of
                                exhibiting to President Carías and other interested Honduran
                                officials certain slides which had been made in the Department. The
                                President, as Mr. Ocheltree informed the Department, viewed the
                                slides at the Casa Presidencial on July 17, 1939.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Padilla told me that he enjoyed seeing Mr. Ocheltree again and
                                took advantage of the opportunity to talk very frankly with him
                                about the Honduras–Nicaragua border controversy. He said that the
                                effect of showing the slides was to bring home clearly the fact that
                                existing maps of the territory in dispute are inaccurate. This,
                                however, he hastened to point out, was already known to the
                                Hondurans.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Padilla intimated that the Government of Honduras is very much
                                opposed to a new map of the region until it is agreed before the
                                Mediation Commission to accept the validity of the Award of the King
                                of Spain. Then, he added, Honduras will be ready to aid in the
                                preparation of an accurate map of the area in dispute.</p>
                            <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0178"/>
                            <p>He concluded his remarks by stating that it must not be forgotten
                                that the thesis of Honduras in the controversy is the validity of
                                the Award, and the Honduran Government cannot and will not agree to
                                take any steps which might tend to weaken this stand. An aerial
                                survey of the territory, undertaken before the validity of the Award
                                is agreed to, might tend to weaken Honduras’ position, he observed.
                                He pointed out that he realized Honduras may lose territory by a
                                survey and drawing of an accurate map, if the boundary is fixed
                                according to the Award of the King of Spain, but the Government is
                                willing to take this risk in order to have its contention
                                accepted.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>42. Lardizabal, the Chief of Protocol, today informed me in strict
                                confidence and on his own initiative of the following contemplated
                                action by the Honduran Government in connection with the
                                Honduran-Nicaraguan boundary question.</p>
                            <p>Lardizabal said that the technical adviser of the Honduran delegation
                                to the Mediation Conference was told recently in Panama City by
                                Señor Montúfar that Dr. Corrigan and Montúfar would meet soon to
                                discuss question of ending the mediation.</p>
                            <p>My informant stated that Honduras would prefer not to have the
                                mediators meet now. The Foreign Minister has drafted a note to
                                Montúfar asking for a postponement of the projected meeting of the
                                commission, but the protocol chief persuaded him not to send it.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office has now called the Ministers of Honduras in
                                Salvador and Managua to Tegucigalpa for consultation on the subject.
                                Lardizabal stated that the Government plans to persuade their
                                [Minister?] at San Salvador and head of the Honduran delegation to
                                the Conference at San José, to make a special trip to Washington to
                                suggest to the Department that projected meeting be postponed and
                                that no steps be taken for the present by anyone concerned with the
                                dispute. Lardizabal will oppose sending the Minister to Washington.
                                He has asked me to ascertain whether the meeting is actually
                                scheduled to take place. If the Department can supply any pertinent
                                information which I may give to my informant, I should appreciate
                                being informed thereof as soon as possible.</p>

                            <p>43. Reference is made to the Legation’s telegram No. 42, October 25.
                                I have just been advised confidentially that in his conversation
                                with Montúfar at Panama City the Honduran technical adviser asked
                                whether the mediators would affirm the validity of the Alphonso
                                award in their final report, and he was told that the view of
                                Nicaragua on the King’s decision must be considered by the
                                Commission. This reported statement by Montúfar has considerably
                                disturbed Honduran officials, and they hope that no action will be
                                taken by the Mediation Commission at this time. Foreign Office
                                official informs me that, in view of the European situation, it
                                would be most unfortunate for the boundary dispute to flare up again
                                and be discussed in the press and radio. Honduras desires that the
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in the matter be maintained
                                for the present.</p>

                            <p>31. Your telegram no. 42, October 25, 3 p.m. It is our understanding
                                that Dr. Corrigan and Dr. Zúñiga Montúfar have exchanged
                                correspondence with regard to the possibility of holding a meeting
                                of the Mediation Commission sometime in December without the
                                presence of representatives of Honduras and Nicaragua, for the
                                purpose of considering the future course of the mediation.</p>
                            <p>The Department is convinced that the mediation proceedings afford
                                perhaps the most effective means of bringing about a solution of
                                this long-standing dispute and has never entertained the thought of
                                recommending their termination. Moreover, the Department has
                                received no intimation from any source that there is a disposition
                                on the part of the other members of the Commission to terminate the
                                mediation. Please communicate the foregoing informally to the Chief
                                of Protocol or other appropriate officials of the Honduran
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>It is hoped that with this explanation the Honduran Government will
                                desist from any efforts to oppose the proposed meeting, but in the
                                event that it maintains contrary views, it is believed that any

                        <p>The Minister of Guatemala called on his own request. He said that he had
                            called to keep this Government reminded of the suggestion that it
                            informally confer with the British Government in an effort to promote
                            progress in the settlement of the boundary controversy between Great
                            Britain and Guatemala. He also handed me a large bound volume called the
                                <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi>,<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Guatemala, <hi rend="italic">White Book, Controversy Between Guatemala and

                                    Matters: Belize Question</hi> (Guatemala, October 1938).</note>
                            which, he said, contained the entire record in the controversy. I
                            thanked him for this book and added that naturally since I had been
                            suffering from an attack of influenza during the past three weeks and
                            more, I was able to give attention only to the emergency matters arising
                            in the Department. I then said that recalling my conferences with Dr.
                            Salazar, the Foreign Minister of Guatemala, on the subject, I had
                            planned to discuss the matter in an entirely informal way, not on its
                            merits, of course, but from the standpoint of endeavoring to facilitate
                            the settlement of the controversy. The Minister said he appreciated the
                            situation as did his Government and that they would be very appreciative
                            of anything I might thus say to the British.</p>

                            Government would manifest an interest in the matter. At the same time he
                            informed me that the Guatemalan Government would be perfectly satisfied
                            if an agreement could be reached whereby “the territory up to the Sibún

                            Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala in which it was asked

                            The reply of the Department stated that <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is assumed that Your Excellency’s request contemplates the
                                    extension of good offices on the part of the United States to
                                    the end that a solution of the controversy satisfactory to
                                    Guatemala and Great Britain may be reached. Should this
                                    assumption be correct, I am glad to state that the Government of
                                    the United States will make available its good offices in the
                                    event that the British Government joins with that of Guatemala
                                    in requesting such good offices.</p>
                                <p>“If Your Excellency had in mind the submission of the controversy

                                    course be glad to consider the possibility of acting as
                                    arbitrator in the matter, provided Guatemala and Great Britain
                                    jointly requested its assistance in that sense.</p>
                                <p>“I shall be glad to give further consideration to Your
                                    Excellency’s note of September 10, 1936, upon a reply from Your
                                    Excellency clarifying the scope of the request which Your
                                    Excellency wishes to make.”</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>Subsequently the Guatemalan Government in a note dated July 21, 1937
                            proposed to the British Government the arbitration of the dispute by the
                            President of the United States. The British Government accepted the
                            proposal of arbitration but in view of its opinion that the dispute was
                            essentially legal in character, proposed that the problem be submitted
                            to the Permanent Court of International Justice of The Hague. When the
                            Guatemalan Government declined to accept arbitration by the Permanent
                            Court, the British Government stated to the Guatemalan Government “that
                            it would serve no useful purpose to pursue the matter further and that
                            they have therefore no option but to treat the present boundary of

                            <p>The Government of the United States has had its attention drawn on a
                                number of occasions to the controversy which has unfortunately
                                existed for many years between the United Kingdom and the Republic
                                of Guatemala over matters relating to the boundary between that
                                country and British Honduras. It is understood that the controversy
                                is concerned primarily with the application and interpretation of
                                the Treaty of 1859 between the two Governments, in which connection
                                it is recalled that an agreement for carrying out certain of the
                                provisions of that Treaty was entered into in 1863<note n="10" xml:id="d247fn10">For text of the convention signed August 5,
                                    1863, between the Plenipotentiaries of Guatemala and of Her
                                    Britannic Majesty to give compliance to article VII of the
                                    convention of April 30, 1859, see Guatemala, <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi>, p. 245.</note> between representatives of
                                the Government of the United Kingdom and of Guatemala, but that it
                                was never ratified by either party.</p>
                            <p>In October, 1938, the Government of Guatemala published a <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi> relating the history of this
                                controversy and giving the texts of <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0186"/>documents and official correspondence including
                                notes exchanged at various times between His Majesty’s Government
                                and the Guatemalan Government with respect to the possibility of a
                                settlement. The most recent correspondence on that subject
                                apparently began on February 21, 1933, on which date the British
                                Chargé d’Affaires ad interim in Guatemala City addressed a note to
                                the Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the desire of
                                His Majesty’s Government that the delimitation of the boundary
                                between British Honduras and Guatemala be undertaken. In the
                                exchange of notes which ensued there was discussed likewise the
                                question of the fulfillment of the provisions of Article 7 of the
                                Treaty of 1859 regarding the establishment of a means of
                                communication between British Honduras and Guatemala City.
                                Unfortunately the two Governments were unable to reach an agreement
                                concerning the questions at issue, and no recent progress appears to
                                have been made toward a settlement.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States naturally has no desire to
                                express any opinion either as to the merits of the issues involved
                                or as to possible methods of adjustment. It has, however, a very
                                genuine interest in the friendly settlement of any dispute the
                                existence of which tends to impair the cordial relations now
                                prevailing in this hemisphere, and it accordingly could but view
                                with the most profound satisfaction the initiation of practical
                                steps toward an equitable solution of the present problem.</p>
                            <p>During recent years very notable progress has been made in the
                                settlement of boundary disputes in the New World.</p>

                                Governments of Guatemala and Honduras accepted a mutually
                                satisfactory arbitral settlement of their frontier, which has since
                                been delimited.<note n="16" xml:id="d247fn16">See <ref target="frus1932v05#pg_372">

                                Nicaragua and Honduras, these controversies have recently been the
                                subject of amicable negotiation, giving rise to the hope that final

                            <p>The Government of the United States would look with especial pleasure
                                upon a renewal of efforts on the part of the Governments of Great
                                Britain and Guatemala to obtain a satisfactory adjustment of the
                                problems relating to the British Honduras-Guatemala frontier, and it
                                is the earnest hope of the Government of the United States that
                                steps in that direction may be undertaken at an early date. A
                                friendly solution of this long-standing controversy would be a
                                signal example, particularly timely in view of present world

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report a very
                            interesting conversation which took place here in the Legation a few
                            days ago with Don Delfino Sanchez Latour, Chief of Protocol…</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sanchez Latour informed me that President Ubico asked him to let me
                            know that he was becoming very much fed-up over the inaction and delay
                            in the negotiations with the British Government regarding the “Belize
                            dispute”. Mr. Sanchez Latour further informed me that the President had
                            decided to wait one month longer, and that if the negotiations were
                            still at a standstill, he, President Ubico, would then send a note to
                            every American Republic, asking for their cooperation in the settlement
                            of this dispute. He further informed me that after sending this note to
                            the different American Republics and, if he failed to get action or
                            cooperation from them, that he, the President, expected to withdraw any
                            further cooperation of the Guatemalan Government in the other
                            Conferences of American Republics. Mr. Sanchez Latour then went on to
                            say that Guatemala had withdrawn from the League of Nations for this
                            same reason, that is, that the President had seen no good that the small
                            nations of the world were receiving from the League, and that when
                            Guatemala withdrew from the League of Nations quite a few other nations
                            did likewise, and that he believed if Guatemala withdrew its cooperation
                            from the Conferences being held by the American Republics, that there
                            would be other nations which would do the same.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Sanchez Latour that I was very sorry that the President felt
                            this way.</p>
                        <p>Following this, Mr. J. P. Armstrong, President of the International
                            Railways of Central America, a British subject, and a very close friend
                                <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0188"/>of President Ubico, came to
                            call on me day before yesterday, and in the conversation he informed me
                            that President Ubico had sent Mr. Sanchez Latour out to his home a few
                            days ago, and Mr. Sanchez Latour had told him practically word for word
                            the same story the President sent me. It occurs to me that this may only
                            be a threat that President Ubico is making to try and force our
                            Government to aid him in forcing the British Government into action, but
                            still he may carry out his threat, and it could probably have some very
                            serious consequences.</p>

                            your despatch no. 966 of August 12, 1939, in which you report a
                            conversation with the Chief of Protocol of the Guatemalan Foreign Office
                            with regard to the intention of President Ubico of enlisting the support
                            of the other American republics in the controversy with Great Britain
                            over the territory of Belize.</p>
                        <p>I believe that it would be highly regrettable for the contemplated action
                            to be taken at this time, as the intervention of other American
                            republics in the controversy might make it difficult for this Government
                            to continue to take active interest in the conclusion of an amicable
                            settlement of the dispute. Furthermore, such intervention might be
                            considered by the British Government as constituting grounds for
                            declining to resume negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to suggest that you should make any representations to the
                            Guatemalan Government with regard to this question, but it occurs to me
                            that if the Chief of Protocol or other officials of the Guatemalan
                            Government should again refer to the reported plan of President Ubico,
                            you could be guided in your conversation by the foregoing
                            observations.</p>
                        <p>With my very kind personal regards, I am</p>

                            <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0189"/>of a Memorandum, No. 13340, of
                            September 12, which the Legation has received from the Foreign Office,
                            in which the possible inclusion of a resolution regarding the Belize
                            question in the program of the forthcoming Panama Conference<note n="19" xml:id="d250fn19">See <ref target="#pg_15">pp. 15</ref> ff.</note>
                            is discussed.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my telegram under reference, I was at pains in presenting
                            the suggested agenda to the Foreign Minister to mention that my
                            Government hoped that the Government of Guatemala would not propose the
                            addition to the agenda of any questions not directly pertinent to the
                            purposes of the Conference. The receipt of this Memorandum consequently
                            came as a complete surprise.</p>
                        <p>The Department will note that the Memorandum asks whether the United
                            States would be disposed to back a resolution to be proposed by
                            Guatemala at the Conference which would recommend to the study of the
                            American Governments the territorial question between Guatemala and
                            Great Britain, with the eventual purpose of reaching a declaration of
                            continental solidarity in favor of Guatemala in this question.</p>
                        <p>The Memorandum is, as reported in my telegram, but one more evidence of
                            the determination of President Ubico to get something done in regard to
                            the Belize question in the immediate future. The Legation has received
                            information from a variety of sources in recent weeks (see, for example,
                            despatch No. 966 of August 12, 1939), that this was the case. To a
                            certain extent this may be discounted as having been given to impress
                            the Legation with the President’s seriousness, but the President’s
                            stubbornness in pursuing his convictions suggests that he must be
                            rebuffed very gently if this is to be done.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the British Minister called on the President a day or
                            two ago to express his Government’s appreciation for the resumption of
                            service on the Guatemalan sterling debt, and tried to impress on him the
                            difficulty of giving adequate consideration to the question in the
                            Foreign Office at the present time. In spite of the obvious truth of
                            this, the President, so I understand, was obdurate that something be
                            done about the matter in the immediate future.</p>
                        <p>I am also informed that the German Minister called on the President on
                            his return and expressed sympathy for the Guatemalan claims. In this
                            connection the Minister of Finance, Gonzalez Campo, informed a friend
                            that Guatemala would receive Belize within a year—from Germany. The
                            remark was merely a manifestation of Gonzalez Campo’s well known German
                            predilections, but the thought behind it might well work on President
                            Ubico’s mind if he accomplished nothing by other means.</p>
                        <p>The Memorandum under reference, then, is but one move in a well planned
                            campaign inspired by the President’s determination to get <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0190"/>something done in the Belize question.
                            It looks to the recommendation by the Panama Conference that the
                            American Republics study the question, and to an eventual declaration of
                            American solidarity with Guatemala. If the recommendation is
                            sidetracked—as it presumably must be—President Ubico is almost certainly
                            going to be annoyed, and may rock the Pan American boat or take other
                            action which would be detrimental to United States interests. The
                            President is clearly of the opinion that only by making a rumpus can he
                            express his determination to have the matter settled. I therefore
                            respectfully recommend that, if the Guatemalan request is rejected,
                            every effort be made to show consideration for Guatemalan
                            susceptibilities.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to previous reports
                            regarding the Belize question, I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that several developments have recently occurred in connection
                            therewith, the most notable of which is that the British Minister in
                            this city is reported to have received instructions to begin
                            negotiations to settle it.</p>
                        <p>As already reported in my despatches No. 966 of August 12, 1939, and No.
                            994 of September 13, 1939, the President has determined to press for an
                            immediate settlement of the Belize question. In endeavoring to bring
                            pressure he appears to have temporarily abandoned the idea of doing this
                            through financial measures, inasmuch as he has now made good the June 30
                            default on the Guatemalan sterling debt. His latest idea, as
                            particularly revealed by the memorandum enclosed with despatch No. 994,
                            is to line up the American Republics solidly behind him and thereby
                            embarrass Great Britain to the maximum extent possible in its relations
                            with the Americas. The President is reported to hold the view that,
                            inasmuch as eighty years of polite note writing and dignified protests
                            have not accomplished anything toward remedying the wrong which Great
                            Britain had done Guatemala, it is time to try more vigorous methods,
                            which in similar cases have recently produced results in other parts of
                            the world. There is no reason to suppose that, to a man of the
                            President’s temperament, who is in a position at the present critical
                            time to cause a very considerable amount of embarrassment, there will be
                            any reluctance to cause that embarrassment, particularly after the
                            barren results which mildness has hitherto secured. Counsels of prudence
                            do not carry much conviction because of this latter circumstance.</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>The local press has mentioned several items which show the measure of
                            success which has attended the President’s efforts to attain a
                            continental solidarity in favor of Guatemala’s claims. Despatch No. 993
                            of September 12, 1939,<note n="20" xml:id="d251fn20">Not printed.</note>
                            mentioned two articles recently written in the Costa Rican newspapers
                            regarding the question. On September 18 <hi rend="italic">Nuestro
                                Diario</hi> transcribed an editorial which had been published in <hi rend="italic">La Noticia</hi> of Managua supporting the Guatemalan
                            claim. Moreover, <hi rend="italic">El Imparcial</hi> on September 19
                            published a speech made by a Chilean Senator before the Congress of that
                            country, upholding the Guatemalan contention. The evidence, taken in
                            conjunction, clearly indicates that Guatemala is conducting a systematic
                            campaign to secure the adherence of the other American nations to the
                            resolution of continental solidarity mentioned in the memorandum sent on
                            September 12, 1939, to this Legation.</p>
                        <p>I am very confidentially informed that the British Minister has just
                            received instructions from his Government to begin Negotiations with the
                            Guatemalan Government regarding the Belize question. Upon what basis
                            these negotiations were to be undertaken was not mentioned. The Minister
                            himself has informed me that he has just recommended to his Government
                            that it accept President Ubico’s earlier proposal that the controversy
                            be submitted to the arbitration of President Roosevelt (this
                            recommendation was evidently made subsequent to the receipt of the above
                            mentioned instructions). An official of the Foreign Office has confirmed
                            to me that no negotiations have as yet been undertaken.</p>
                        <p>I am also confidentially informed … that the Foreign Minister … did not
                            wish to convey President Ubico’s demands to the British Minister upon
                            the latter’s arrival in this country, and that therefore the President
                            entrusted this task to his friend. This gentleman (whose information I
                            consider absolutely trustworthy) states that President Ubico demanded
                            all of British Honduras south of the Sibun River, and £1,000,000, with
                            which he agreed to pay off the British sterling debt.</p>
                        <p>I am under the impression that the British Minister … is of the opinion
                            that the only hope of settling the controversy … is to accept the
                            earlier Guatemalan proposal of arbitration by President Roosevelt.</p>
                        <p>The President is thus apparently determined to press for an immediate
                            settlement and to utilize his nuisance value to the full in attaining
                            his ends. For the moment he is invoking the continental solidarity of
                            the Americas in support of his claims. He is evidently backing this by a
                            propaganda campaign. The British Minister has been authorized to start
                            negotiations looking to the settlement of the controversy, but has
                            suggested to his Government that Great Britain <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0192"/>accept the earlier Guatemalan proposal
                            to submit the matter to the arbitration of President Roosevelt.</p>

                                Question, III (Guatemala, April, 1941), p. 131.</note> As reported
                            in my telegram under reference, the Minister gave me a copy of this note
                            the following day. The Department will observe that the note declares it
                            to be the British Government’s intention to reopen negotiations
                            regarding the Belize question as soon as the war situation permits.</p>
                        <p>The British Minister was obviously pleased at having received the
                            instructions to hand in this note. He said that his cabled instructions
                            had arrived two days before, but that they had been so badly garbled
                            that he had been able to deliver the note only on September 20. He
                            wished to inform the local press immediately of the intention of the
                            British Government to resume negotiations, but I pointed out to him that
                            this was the President’s pet problem of the moment, and that, being out
                            of town, he might be irritated at having a major development in this
                            matter known to the public before he had heard of it. The British
                            Minister then intimated that, before saying anything to the press, he
                            would make certain that this would be agreeable to the President.</p>
                        <p>The Minister also mentioned to me that agitation by the Guatemalan
                            Government, either at the Panama Conference, or in the Latin American
                            press, might cause his Government to modify its present intention to
                            reopen negotiations with regard to the question.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the British Legation on the evening of September 21
                            intimated in a private conversation that prior to the delivery of this
                            note, but evidently subsequent to the first instructions regarding the
                            reopening of the negotiations received by his Minister (See Despatch No.
                            1002 of September 20, 1939), the Minister’s recommendation to his
                            Government that the question be submitted to the arbitration of
                            President Roosevelt, as once proposed by Guatemala, had been rejected
                                <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0193"/>by the British Foreign
                            Office. The Secretary said that the Foreign Office considered one man
                            arbitration out of date. The Secretary also stated that it had been very
                            difficult even to persuade the British Foreign Office to authorize the
                            sending of the note under reference. This of course may have been said
                            for effect, but there are other indications that the Foreign Office is
                            as unenthusiastic about endeavoring to settle this question as President
                            Ubico is zealous to secure a handsome settlement quickly.</p>
                        <p>This morning the Chief of Protocol personally delivered to me a
                            confidential covering note enclosing a copy of the British note and a
                            copy of the Guatemalan reply thereto. A copy and translation of the
                            Guatemalan reply is enclosed with this despatch.<note n="23" xml:id="d252fn23">For text, see Guatemala, <hi rend="italic">Continuation, of the White Book</hi>, III, p. 132.</note> This
                            exchange of notes was published by the Foreign Office this evening. The
                            Department will observe that the Guatemalan note receives the British
                            statement cordially, although its generally friendly tone may perhaps be
                            said to be slightly marred by the reference to the “lapsed Convention of
                            1859.”</p>
                        <p>I took the occasion afforded by the delivery of this note to mention to
                            the Chief of Protocol that it would be dangerous to the success of the
                            negotiations if an effort was made by Guatemala at the present time to
                            secure the open backing of the other American Republics in this dispute.
                            The Chief of Protocol has now informed me that instructions have been
                            sent to Foreign Minister Salazar, who is now in Panama, informing him of
                            the British note, and directing him to await the arrival of further air
                            mail instructions before taking any action on his earlier instructions.
                            The Chief of Protocol stated in our second conversation that after my
                            talks with him, he had no doubt that the President would cease his
                            efforts to obtain the declaration of continental solidarity in support
                            of Guatemala’s claims envisaged by the Guatemalan Memorandum of
                            September 12, 1939.<note n="24" xml:id="d252fn24">Not printed; see

                  </p>
                        <p>The generally cordial tone of the two notes, particularly the British, in
                            conjunction with the sympathetic action of President Ubico in ordering
                            the resumption of service on the Guatemalan sterling debt, should create
                            an atmosphere favorable to the initiation of the negotiations. At the
                            same time, even the British Minister’s ideas of generosity in the
                            problem seem to fall far short of the minimum which President Ubico
                            would accept as a direct settlement. There seems unfortunately to be an
                            equal disagreement regarding arbitration. Moreover, it must again be
                            emphasized that President Ubico is impatient for a settlement of this
                            question, and that the more favorable atmosphere which has apparently
                            been created may well be dissipated, so far as the <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0194"/>Guatemalan Government is concerned, if
                            the British note is not soon followed up by some concrete proposal.</p>
                        <p>The British Minister has thus handed the Guatemalan Foreign Office a note
                            stating that the British Government intends to reopen negotiations
                            regarding the Belize question, as soon as the war situation permits, on
                            the basis of proposals already under consideration by the British
                            Foreign Office before the outbreak of the war. This note, and likewise
                            the Guatemalan acknowledgement thereof, were couched in generally
                            cordial terms. President Ubico has evidently been persuaded to desist
                            from his plan to secure a declaration of continental solidarity by the
                            American Republics in support of the Guatemalan claims. The British
                            Foreign Office seems to have rejected the British Minister’s
                            recommendation that the question be submitted to the arbitration of
                            President Roosevelt, as earlier proposed by Guatemala. While the
                            atmosphere thus seems to be much improved for starting negotiations, it
                            must not be assumed that it will be easy or even necessarily possible to
                            find a solution which will be satisfactory to both Guatemala and Great
                            Britain.</p>

                        <p>Please inform the appropriate officials of the Guatemalan Government that
                            the British Embassy in Washington has communicated to the Department in
                            an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> dated September 21<note n="26" xml:id="d253fn26">Not printed.</note> what is apparently the
                            substance of a recent British note on the subject of the dispute over
                            the boundary of Belize. The <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            indicates that the British Government proposes “as soon as the war
                            situation permits, to reopen negotiations with the Guatemalan Government
                            on the basis of new proposals which were in fact actually forming the
                            subject of careful consideration when hostilities broke out”.</p>
                        <p>It would seem appropriate for you to state to the Acting Foreign Minister
                            that in view of the intention of the British Government to reopen
                            negotiations, the matter would seem to be progressing favorably so that
                            its consideration by the 21 American countries at Panama would seem
                            premature. You may state that this Government is informing its delegate
                            at the Panama meeting of the memorandum dated September 12, 1939,
                            presented by the Guatemalan Government and is <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0195"/>confident that he will give sympathetic
                            attention to any views which Dr. Salazar may care to express.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, the Department approves the efforts
                            which you have made to discourage the Guatemalan Government from
                            bringing the subject of this dispute into the Panama meeting, and hopes
                            that on account of the British note the Guatemalan Government will not
                            press the question at Panama.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing has been repeated to Mr. Welles.<note n="27" xml:id="d253fn27">Sumner Welles, then at Panama, as delegate of the

                        <p>40. Department’s telegram No. 37, September 23, 3 p.m. The Department
                            will note from despatch No. 1003, of September 22, that I had already
                            apparently dissuaded the Guatemalans from raising the Belize question at
                            Panama. I conveyed the other points in the Department’s telegram to the
                            Acting Secretary this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary read to me parts of a despatch from Mr. Salazar
                            stating that Mr. Welles had informed him that the Department had
                            received a note from the British Embassy stating that the British would
                            reopen negotiations after the termination of war. The <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0196"/>despatch added that Mr. Welles had
                            spontaneously promised to make vigorous representations to the Embassy
                            upon his return to Washington that there was no relation between this
                            question and the termination of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that his Government was disturbed at this
                            because the war might last several years. He added that the British had
                            asked that the matter be omitted at Panama City and that the local
                            propaganda be curbed and also said that the Germans were broadcasting
                            propaganda to the effect that this was a case in which Great Britain had
                            broken a treaty with a weak nation. The Acting Secretary expressed the
                            fear that the British might be merely playing for time.</p>
                        <p>I point out that neither the British note to the Foreign Office nor the
                            Embassy’s note to the Department as quoted in the Department’s telegram
                            spoke of the termination of the war. The Acting Secretary was very
                            pleased at this information and again expressed his Government’s
                            appreciation for our efforts in the matter.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telegram No. 40 of
                            September 25, 6 p.m., 1939, I have the honor to discuss the developments
                            in the Belize question which have occurred since September 22 (see my
                            despatch No. 1003 of that date).</p>
                        <p>As reported in my telegram under reference, I did not immediately call on
                            the Acting Foreign Minister, Licenciado Carlos Fernández Cordova, to
                            discuss with him the points mentioned in the Department’s telegram,
                            inasmuch as the major point—the question of whether the Belize dispute
                            should be brought before the Panama Conference—appeared already to have
                            been settled. On Monday afternoon, however, I informed him that the
                            Department had received a note evidently worded in almost precisely the
                            same language as the note which the Guatemalan Foreign Office had
                            received, and that Mr. Welles would be glad to give sympathetic
                            attention at Panama to any views which Mr. Salazar might express.</p>

                        <p>At the conclusion of our conversation the Ambassador said that he was
                            very gratified to be able to inform me that the British Government had
                            determined to propose to the Government of Guatemala the immediate
                            arbitration of the controversy between Guatemala and Great Britain
                            involving the frontier between Guatemala and British Honduras and the
                            provisions of the Treaty of 1856 [<hi rend="italic">1859</hi>]. The
                            British Government intended to propose as the arbitral tribunal an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> tribunal composed of international
                            lawyers, provided the President of the United States would agree to
                            appoint as umpire on such tribunal an American citizen. The Ambassador
                            said that if the President consented to take such action, his Government
                            trusted that the President would select as umpire some outstanding judge
                            in the United States, preferably an Associate Justice of the Supreme
                            Court.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that it would give me much pleasure to submit this
                            information to the President for his decision, and that I believed the
                            determination arrived at by the British Government would be warmly
                            received on this continent and would have very favorable results in
                            stimulating the rapid solution of all existing boundary controversies by
                            means of arbitration.</p>

                            know that he will gladly assume the responsibility of designating a

                        <p>51. The British Ambassador yesterday informed me that the British
                            Government was now prepared to propose to the Government of Guatemala
                            the arbitration of the controversy between the two Governments by an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> tribunal of international lawyers,
                            provided the President of the United States would agree to select a
                            United States citizen as umpire on the tribunal. The President has today
                            authorized me to inform the British Ambassador that he will be glad to
                            accept this responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I assume consequently that the British Government will in the immediate
                            future inform the Guatemalan Government of the proposal above mentioned,
                            but because of the conversation I had with Dr. Salazar in Panama, I
                            shall appreciate it if you will inform him of the above for his
                            confidential information, and express to him my great pleasure that
                            arbitration of this dispute will now be possible and that the umpire
                            will be an American citizen. Please extend to him my personal
                            felicitations on the success of his long and patient negotiations in
                            this matter and state that this development appears to me to be a
                            further happy indication that boundary controversies on this continent
                            are susceptible of solution by juridical procedure.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Under Secretary</hi>: Thank you very much
                            for your letter of November 15th in which you informed me that the
                            President had intimated that he would be prepared to nominate a citizen
                            of the United States to serve as umpire on the <hi rend="italic">ad
                                hoc</hi> tribunal of international lawyers which it is suggested
                            should be set up to arbitrate in the controversy between His Majesty’s
                            Government and the Guatemalan Government. <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0199"/>As I said at our interview on November 14th the terms
                            of reference to this tribunal would be to arbitrate as to the alleged
                            nonfulfilment by His Majesty’s Government of the convention of 1859
                            between Great Britain and Guatemala. Article 7, I understand, is the
                            question in dispute.</p>
                        <p>I am naturally very glad to hear of the President’s decision, and am most
                            grateful to him for having responded so quickly to our suggestion and to
                            you for your kind assistance in the matter. I am informing the Foreign
                            Office of the President’s reply and will of course let you know how
                            matters develop.</p>

                        <p>57. The Secretary of the British Legation informs me that his Government
                            will insist upon an important reservation in connection with the
                            proposal outlined in the Department’s telegram No. 51, November 15, 5
                            p.m. to wit: that the arbitration shall be confined to the consequences
                            of the nonfulfillment by Great Britain of the 1859 Treaty. Although he
                            denied that this reservation would absolutely prevent the Arbitral
                            Tribunal from rendering a decision providing for any territorial
                            readjustment his earlier remarks made it reasonably clear that this was
                            the object of the reservation.</p>
                        <p>It appears from comment made to the Legation by Foreign Office officials
                            that the President would be willing to accept the proposal foreshadowed
                            in the Department’s telegram but that he is not enthusiastic about it.
                            It seems improbable, however, that he will accept the British proposal
                            with a reservation excluding the possibility of territorial readjustment
                            inasmuch as Guatemala now holds that the 1859 Treaty is void.</p>
                        <p>The Department may wish to consider whether the fact that the Guatemalan
                            Government was not informed by this Legation of a reservation which the
                            British Government apparently intends to incorporate in its proposals
                            might not eventually give rise to suspicions which would jeopardize the
                            success of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The British Legation while fully informed of the proposals has evidently
                            not yet been instructed to present them.</p>

                            that he have an informal chat with me to ascertain whether this
                            Government was aware of any new developments with regard to the dispute
                            with Great Britain over Belize or had further information as to exactly
                            the scope of the proposed arbitration. Dr. Recinos stated that naturally
                            Dr. Salazar, having worked for so many years on the dispute, was
                            desirous of pushing its solution as rapidly as possible to a
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>I informed Dr. Recinos that we also did not have a clear idea of exactly
                            what sort of arbitration the British were prepared to accept. In an
                            endeavor to secure a more precise definition, Mr. Welles had decided to
                            approach the British Ambassador again. This would probably be done some
                            time during the week so that we might know more of the British attitude
                            in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he knew Dr. Salazar would appreciate this
                            further effort on the part of the United States to advance the matter
                            and that he would deeply appreciate my informing him opportunely of any
                            further information that might be secured from the British Ambassador
                            regarding the intentions of his Government.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I wish to refer to your
                            note of November 20 with regard to the proposal for arbitration of the
                            Belize matter.</p>

                        <p>Advices received from Guatemala convey the impression that the Guatemalan
                            Government might be reluctant to proceed to arbitration unless the
                            arbitral compromise include some provision for settlement of the
                            fundamental issues involved in the event that it should be determined
                            that there had not been compliance with Article VII of the 1859 Treaty.
                            I think you will agree that such a provision would facilitate a
                            satisfactory solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful therefore if you could confirm my understanding that
                            it is your Government’s intention that the arbitral tribunal be
                            empowered to effect a settlement of all of the issues involved.</p>
                        <p>Believe me,</p>

                            forthcoming British proposals respecting the Belize question. He took
                            advantage of the opportunity to mention casually, but with obvious
                            emphasis, the President’s intense interest in the Belize question,
                            saying with a laugh that the President had given orders that he was not
                            to be troubled during the next few days except about the Belize matter,

                            <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guatemala has the
                                honor to refer to the courteous Memorandum of the Honorable
                                Department of State of the United States, dated June 8<note n="32" xml:id="d265fn32">
                           <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_177">p. 177</ref>.</note> of the current year,
                                in which, expressing its legitimate interest in the solution of the
                                controversy existing between the Government of Guatemala and <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0202"/>that of Great Britain
                                relative to the territory of Belize, it states that it would view
                                with profound satisfaction the initiation of practical negotiations
                                for the solution of the question.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Guatemala has received with the greatest
                                satisfaction this high initiative of the Government of the United
                                States, in view of the fact that it brings the well founded hope
                                that His British Majesty’s Government are to agree to and satisfy
                                the unquestionable rights of Guatemala, always sustained by the
                                latter and continually evaded by the Foreign Office and its
                                Diplomatic Representatives. But, as the Memorandum of the Department
                                of State refers definitely to “the frontier adjustment between
                                Belize and Guatemala,”<note n="33" xml:id="d265fn33">The words used
                                    were: “… to the boundary between that country and British
                                    Honduras.”</note> this Government has deemed it pertinent to
                                study the question in a form which definitely and conclusively
                                establishes the origin, circumstances and present state of the
                                question. To afford the maximum veracity to Guatemala’s statement,
                                preference has been given, without mentioning the voluminous
                                Guatemalan proofs, solely and exclusively, in so far as possible, to
                                genuine English or United States evidence. Guatemala’s right is so
                                absolute, is so founded on truth and justice, that with official
                                documents of the Governments of England and the United States, the
                                whole subject may be reconstructed, with very ample details, giving
                                at the same time the best proof of the Republic’s rights,
                                brilliantly defined and defended by the Government of the United
                                States itself. But, because documents other than those of the
                                Government of Guatemala are discussed, the preparation of the book
                                with which it desires to amplify this memorandum has been laborious,
                                and, in view of the period of time which has elapsed without
                                replying to the Memorandum of the Department of State, the Ministry
                                for Foreign Affairs prefers to do so immediately, and will present
                                at an opportune time the above mentioned book.</p>
                            <p>The controversy between Guatemala and Great Britain does not involve
                                a boundary question only; it involves a territorial matter, as is
                                proved hereinafter.</p>

                                        being desirous of preventing, as much as possible the causes
                                        of complaint and misunderstanding, to which this
                                        inter-mixture of Spanish and British Wood cutters gave rise,
                                        it was thought expedient that the Spanish Government should
                                        assign to British subjects for the purpose of wood cutting a
                                        separate and sufficiently extensive and convenient district
                                        of the Coast of America, and that in consideration of much
                                            [<hi rend="italic">such?</hi>] Assignment, British
                                        Subjects should be restricted from forming settlements in
                                        any other part of the Spanish Territories in America,
                                        whether Continental or Insular: and that all British
                                        Subjects dispersed in those Spanish possessions, would
                                        within eighteen months after the exchange of the
                                        ratifications of the Treaty, retire within the District
                                        specially assigned for their occupation and use.</p>
                                    <p>It seems however that the Treaty of 1783 did not sufficiently
                                        accomplish the purpose of preventing complaints and
                                        misunderstandings. It was found by Great Britain on the one
                                        hand, that the district of the coast of Honduras assigned to
                                        British Subjects by the 6th Article of the Treaty of 1783,
                                        was too limited in extent; and the enjoyment of it was too
                                        much narrowed by the restrictions contained in that Article.

                                relative to Belize, because the latter belonged to Guatemalan
                                jurisdiction. This will be proved farther on.</p>

                                that as Secretary of State, he agreed with Mr. King, President of

                                        concluded between England and the Mexican Republic, in which
                                        it is given to understand or is supposed that the latter has
                                        rights in the territories of the concessions of Belize,
                                        which is not exact, and consequently, the Government of
                                        Guatemala never has been able to agree to that view, which
                                        also should not be passed over in silence when signing an
                                        act so solemn and public as is the treaty with England; so
                                        that in no case nor at any time can consent or acquiescence
                                        relative to that question be interpreted into it or perhaps
                                        deduced.</p>
                                    <p>For this purpose, I address the present communication to Your
                                        Honor, by order of H. E. the President, in order to record
                                        expressly the understanding which we have reached and do
                                        reach to the effect that the treaty signed on June 25 in no
                                        way involves or affects the rights of the Republic of
                                        Guatemala in the boundary matter relative to the concessions
                                        in the territory of Belize, to which the treaty of 1783 and
                                        the convention of 1786 between H. Britannic M. and H.
                                        Catholic M. relate.</p>
                                    <p>Hoping that Your Honor will be so good as to reply to me at
                                        your convenience acknowledging this information and stating
                                        that you are in agreement with these views, I have the honor
                                        to reiterate to you the expressions of courtesy and esteem
                                        with which I sign myself, respectfully yours, (s) J. Mariano

                                    <p>Guatemala, 19 July, 1847. Sr. don José Mariano Rodríguez,
                                        etc., etc.</p>
                                    <p>I have had the honour of receiving your Note of the 8th
                                        instant upon the boundary of this Republic on the side of
                                        Her Britannic Majesty’s Settlement in Honduras, which shall
                                        be submitted to Her Majesty’s Government.</p>
                                    <p>Without instructions I can give no opinion on this subject.
                                        Nevertheless I may so far comply with your wish as to say
                                        that I conceive that the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and
                                        Navigation which we lately signed on the part of our
                                        respective Governments need not affect any arrangement which
                                        the Government of this Republic may desire to conclude at a
                                        future time with Great Britain respecting boundaries.</p>
                                    <p>I have the honor, etc. (f) Fred. Chatfield.</p>

                     </p>
                            <p>And so the Government of Guatemala, invoking the Anglo-Spanish Pacts
                                of 1783 and 1786, repudiated emphatically the British claims to that
                                territory, and at the same time repudiated the supposition that, by
                                    <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0207"/>virtue of the
                                Anglo-Mexican Pact of 1826, it might appear that the Mexican
                                Republic had some title to sovereignty over Belize. The British
                                representative tacitly accepted that Guatemalan reservation, since
                                he did nothing in the name of his Government, then or subsequently,
                                relative to any British right to the aforesaid region. Certainly he
                                said that the Treaty need not affect any arrangement which the
                                (Government) of this Republic might desire to conclude at a future
                                time with Great Britain respecting boundaries; but the patent fact
                                was fully proved that the English could only invoke, while the
                                matter was being adjusted between the Governments of Guatemala and
                                Great Britain, usufructuary rights derived from the concession
                                stipulated in the pacts of 1783 and 1786: on the other hand, the
                                reference to boundaries made by Plenipotentiary Chatfield as a reply
                                to the reservation of territorial rights by the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs of Guatemala, in accordance with Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence,
                                implied the title of the parties to the disputed region.</p>
                            <p>Indeed, it was without the Treaty of 1847 having been ratified,
                                although the Guatemalan reservation was in full force—since the
                                English Government did not answer it—that the Anglo-Guatemalan
                                Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation of February 20, 1849<note n="38" xml:id="d265fn38">
                           <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign

                                    32.</note> was signed: the pact contains superabundant
                                stipulations relative to maritime commerce, navigation, guarantees
                                and prerogatives in favor of their respective nationals in the
                                territories of the two parties, but neither Belize nor British
                                Honduras are even mentioned in any article whatever of the sixteen
                                articles of the pact, nor is any mention made of land commerce. The
                                plenipotentiaries signed the pact as if the King of Spain had never
                                granted any territory whatever under Guatemala’s jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>This fact is of singular importance, since Great Britain had been
                                trying to obtain the territorial cession in exchange for the
                                recognition of Guatemala to such an extreme that the Plenipotentiary
                                Zebadua was in London from 1825 to 1830 without securing reception
                                in his official character as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
                                Plenipotentiary of Central America: on December 30, 1835, the
                                Government of Guatemala appealed to the Government of the United
                                States, asking aid in face of the growing claims of the Government
                                of Great Britain (Manning, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, III,
                                87/9), and for this purpose the Central American Plenipotentiary,
                                Colonel Juan Galindo, was negotiating in Washington for that
                                purpose. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, III.) Colonel Galindo went
                                to London, aided by a letter of recommendation from Mr. Forsyth,
                                Secretary of State, to Mr. Aaron Vail, Chargé d’Affaires of the
                                United States before the English Government (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, VII, 254/5); but Her Majesty’s Government, to avoid
                                taking into consideration Guatemala’s <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0208"/>rights, refused to receive the Central American
                                delegate, under the pretext that he was of Irish descent. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, III, 165.)</p>
                            <p>In 1833, the English Government appointed Mr. Frederick Chat-field as
                                Consul and, by virtue of a consultation of the Foreign Office with
                                the Colonial Office, he brought instructions to discuss the
                                boundaries of Belize to the South on the Sarstoon River and that
                                “the Central American Government should relinquish all claim to such
                                rights of sovereignty over the territory comprised within the
                                boundary of the Settlement as might be supposed to have accrued to
                                them derivatively from Old Spain.” (Alder Burdon, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, II, 372.) Mr. Chatfield failed in his attempt:
                                on June 1, 1835, Colonel Galindo, Special Agent of Central America
                                before the Government of the United States, informed the Secretary
                                of State that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        authorities of Belize took upon themselves in November last
                                        to declare their limits to be the Hondo on the North, the
                                        Sarstoon on the South &amp; on the West a line drawn

                                        Belize, thus exceeding the old grant by at least five fold.
                                        At this period the plenipotentiary of H. B. M. at San
                                        Salvador proposed the conclusion of a commercial treaty with
                                        his nation, but as he distinctly refused the insertion of an
                                        article similar to that in the Mexican treaty with Great
                                        Britain, limiting the settlers of Belize to their lawful
                                        boundaries, his proposal was of course declined. (Manning,

                            <p>The English have talked a great deal about “occupation” of the
                                territory comprised as far as the Sarstoon River; but that
                                occupation was not effected except by acts of pillage at the mouths
                                of the Guatemalan rivers. Colonel Galindo, representative of
                                Guatemala in 1835, so explained to the Secretary of State: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                “And I have not known or heard of one American Merchantman or Man of

                                    cit.</hi>, III, 294.) Great Britain exercised economic and
                                political domination in Guatemala—and by means of that threat, in
                                view of the fact that it was impossible to execute her instructions
                                relative to obtaining the territorial cession of Belize, she kept
                                silent in this respect in the Treaty of recognition.</p>
                            <p>But such silence does not signify anything against Guatemala. It does
                                not destroy the violation of the right of the weak; nor does it give
                                it to the aggressor: Mr. Ephraim George Squier, Chargé d’Affaires of
                                the United States in Guatemala, warned Mr. Frederick Chat-field,
                                Chargé d’Affaires of Great Britain in Guatemala, on October 28,
                                1849: “There is sir, as between civilized nations, but one mode of
                                acquiring territory, viz: by Treaty; and it has come to be
                                understood that, the rights of conquest require to be thus
                                sanctioned, in order to be regarded as permanent.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, III, 492.) That reticence of

                                Anglo-Guatemalan pact of 1849 signified nothing against Guatemala,
                                because Great Britain had no title to the possession of the
                                territory usufructed by virtue of the Treaties of 1783 and 1786, and
                                if Guatemala were to consent to maintain it, her boundaries could
                                only be those agreed upon in said pacts by the Kings of Spain and
                                Great Britain: according to the jurisprudence fixed in article IV of

                            <p>So clear was the right of Guatemala and the violent injustice of
                                Great Britain, that they were superabundantly proved during the
                                course of the controversy relative to Central American affairs,
                                sustained between Washington and London which culminated in the
                                Clayton–Bulwer Treaty (1850). When the moment arrived to make this
                                treaty effective, England refused to honor her word relative to the
                                evacuation of the points of the Central American Atlantic coast
                                which she held. In a communication of July 26, 1856, Mr. William L.
                                Marcy, Secretary of State, reviewed the entire questions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>We see, in the first place, that England can have no rights
                                        of possession or jurisdiction in Central America, except
                                        such as her treaties with Spain of 1786 and 1814 accord to
                                        her, or except such as she may have acquired by voluntary
                                        concession from some one of the Republics of Central
                                        America. Anything beyond that will be incipient conquest
                                        only, not yet consummated into full right, by treaty
                                        recognition.</p>
                                    <p>We see in the second place, that all the matters in dispute
                                        between the United States and Great Britain are primarily
                                        questions of the sovereign rights of some one of the
                                        Republics of Central America. We cannot give to Great
                                        Britain, nor she take from us that which neither has to
                                        concede. Either of us may agree with the other not to claim
                                        anything in Central America, but neither can legitimate any
                                        claim of the other there. And if either of us having
                                        asserted claim there, is to relinquish the same under
                                        conditions, the ultimate decision of those conditions
                                        appertains solely to the interested Republic of Central
                                        America. We may separately, or in common, use our good
                                        offices with such Republic to influence its determination,
                                        but we cannot of ourselves make the determination. (Manning,

                                Republic. Mr. Marcy set forth in his above mentioned note of July
                                26, 1856, to Mr. Dallas: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>It is the indisputable fact that England possesses no other
                                        treaty rights at the Belize except the usufruct conceded by
                                        Spain, and which so late as the year 1826, the British
                                        Government deemed it important to have confirmed to England
                                        by the Mexican Republic, as the presumed sovereign, at that
                                        time, or the country in which the settlement of the Belize
                                        exists.</p>
                                    <p>It is understood that Guatemala contests the claim of the
                                        Mexican Republic in this respect; and it may be that the
                                        precise limits of the two Republics on that side are
                                        undetermined. However that may be, it is certain that the
                                        appellation of Honduras commonly applied in England to the
                                        settlement of the Belize is a misnomer originating perhaps
                                        in local projects of aggrandizement.</p>
                                    <p>By the correspondence exchanged between Sir Henry Bulwer and
                                        Mr. Clayton, the negotiators of the Convention of 1850, it
                                        was declared that, according to their understanding, the
                                        stipulations of non-occupation made by Great Britain, were
                                        not intended to apply to the Belize. Whatever weight this
                                        correspondence may have as a contemporaneous exposition of
                                        the Convention, it cannot in the judgment of the President,
                                        be held to operate as an enlargement either of the limits or
                                        the jurisdiction of the British settlement at the
                                        Belize.</p>

                            <p>At any rate, the Dallas-Clarendon Convention, if it could not
                                “legitimate the English claim”, gave proof that the weak Republic of
                                Guatemala had lost, for its defense against England, the only hope
                                of maintaining its integrity: the support of the United States. The
                                Congress of the United States approved without reservation the
                                stipulation relative to the boundaries of Belize—and Great Britain
                                constituted herself as absolute arbitrator to settle to her taste

                                Britain: on April 30, 1859, she was obliged to sign the “Boundary”

                                with the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty, those “boundaries” were fixed as

                                        checked and prevented for the future. (<hi rend="italic">White Book</hi>, English Edition, 105.)</p>

                                consequently neither was that of the compensation stipulated in the

                                and Guatemala made the agreement, in order to conceal in so far as
                                possible the territorial cession and its compensation, since they
                                flagrantly violated the Monroe Doctrine and the Clayton–Bulwer

                                herself, to her own detriment, to the English maneuver, without
                                invoking in her favor the powerful arguments presented by the
                                Representative of the United States, Mr. Beverly L. Clarke? Because
                                Lennox Wyke explained to the Government of Guatemala that, for the
                                solution of the disputes pending between the United States and Great
                                Britain, and as compensation for England’s concessions, the
                                Government of the United States had agreed to England’s taking
                                control of Belize: in the same note number 23 of July 26, 1856,

                                    <p>By the correspondence exchanged between Sir Henry Bulwer and
                                        Mr. Clayton, the negotiators of the Convention of 1850, it
                                        was declared that, according to their understanding the

                                        not intended to apply to the Belize. Whatever weight this

                                    <p>As to the limits of that settlement on the South, it must be
                                        a question of either of the rights of Guatemala or of those
                                        of Honduras, while the question of the political tenure of
                                        that settlement would seem to belong to Guatemala, or to the
                                        Mexican Republic. Of course, in the spirit of the Treaty,
                                        the President is prepared to exert the influence of the
                                        United States with either of those Republics to assist in
                                        promoting the adjustment of those questions in a
                                        satisfactory manner.</p>
                                    <p>In a commercial or political point of view it is not of very
                                        much moment to the United States, whether the British tenure
                                        at the Belize be enlarged or not; but it is in a military
                                        point of view, a thing of importance alike to the Central
                                        American States, to the Mexican Republic and to the United
                                        States.</p>

                                        reconciling Great Britain to other acts which she may be

                                there was left for the Government of the Republic only the road of
                                agreeing to the consummated acts. It was human to seek, under such
                                an adverse situation, the best road: the Dallas-Clarendon pact fixed
                                for England “the southern boundary as far as the Sarstoon River;”
                                but it left to the discretion of Great Britain settling the
                                enlargement of the English boundary toward the west,—“the limits of
                                the said Belize on the west, as they existed on the said 19th of
                                April, 1850, shall, if possible, be settled and fixed by Treaty
                                between Her Britannic Majesty and the Republic of Guatemala.” The
                                sooner Guatemala agreed to the decision of Great Britain, the less
                                expansion could the latter give to her western boundary. On his
                                part, the attainment of legitimate title, the Treaty, for British
                                possession of Belize, was urgent for the British Plenipotentiary,
                                and so he consented to Article VII, the stipulation of which was
                                prohibited him, according to the declaration of Lord Stanley
                                transcribed above.</p>
                            <p>In their diplomatic correspondence, the Government of Great Britain
                                have come to deny the eminently compensatory character of Article
                                VII of the boundary Convention of 1859. Nevertheless, the Government
                                of Guatemala can produce an official English explanation of that
                                compensatory character. In his confidential note of June 29, 1862,
                                the British Minister Mr. George W. Mathew stated to the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The advantages, which Guatemala will derive from the road, by
                                        opening a vast district of rich country, are unquestionable:
                                        but there will not be a demand in this capital for one
                                        single additional bale of British goods, by their being
                                        brought by way of Izabal, instead of by the Cape or Manama,
                                        and S. José! We can only look therefore, to some future
                                        increase of the wealth of the population along the road, <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0214"/>if it be kept in

                                        consumption for any commercial benefit.</p>
                                    <p>The idea then, of indirect compensation, must be the main
                                        reason, that leads Great Britain to incur any expenditure in
                                        the matter: and in this view I am willing to concur,
                                        although, after some investigation in England, I cannot deny
                                        my impression that the “debateable land” was conquered from
                                        the Spaniards in war time, by the Belize Colonists, with the
                                        aid of Royal forces, and was never restored. (<hi rend="italic">White Book</hi>, English Edition, p.

                                1859, made by the English Minister precisely in a document directed
                                to discuss the Republic’s rights attains special importance: “the
                                idea then, of indirect compensation, must be the main reason, that
                                leads Great Britain to incur any expenditure in the matter,” he
                                said, and in that manner agree in an official English statement to
                                the declarations of the Government of Guatemala relative to having
                                concealed in so far as possible, in adjusting the delivery of

                                compensation. Seven months later, in his note of January 27, 1863,
                                the English Minister Mr. Mathew ratified that statement, clarifying

                                that there has been no such occupation; two years after the
                                consummation of the territorial cession of Belize, the English
                                Government ordered the taking of a census of the population of the
                                territory, which on April 1, 1861, gave 25,000 persons, distributed
                                as follows: Port of Belize, 5,067; towns of Hondo River, New River
                                and Cerozal, 13,547; Stann Creek 1,113; Punta Gorda, 306. (Aldor

                                along the lower channel of the rivers, just as they did when in 1835
                                Colonel Galindo, Representative of Guatemala in Washington, informed
                                the Secretary of State that the English were encroaching in

                                III, 88.)</p>
                            <p>Of the towns mentioned, Belize, Rio Hondo, New River and Cerozal are
                                situated within the demarcation of the Anglo-Spanish pacts of 1783
                                and 1786: to the South of the Sibun are only Stann Creek and Punta

                                the mouth of the Sarstoon. The six towns which the English census of
                                1861 mentions are directly on the seashores: the interior of the
                                country, even in 1939, is unexplored to such an extent that a modern

                                Belize, needed title to sovereignty which, classified as a political
                                possession, the Secretary of State Mr. Marcy attributed to the
                                Republic of Guatemala but a few months prior to the signature of the
                                Dallas-Clarendon Treaty. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, VII, 152).
                                By means of the offer of indirect compensation (Mr. George W.
                                Mathew, Minister of England, <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi>, <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0216"/>English Edition, 206,)
                                Great Britain attained the desired title, the pact with
                                Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>In order not to arouse suspicion in the United States, inasmuch as
                                the Convention would violate the Monroe Doctrine and the
                                Clayton–Bulwer Convention, Lennox Wyke secured the most vague
                                wording of the compensatory article: and from the moment of the
                                exchange of ratifications, the English Government began to establish
                                quibbles which, taking into account the antecedents, beginning with
                                the treatment accorded by Mr. Canning to the Plenipotentiary of
                                Central America (1825) up to the controversy of 1859–1933, it is not
                                unwarranted to consider as deliberate. In effect, Article 7 of the
                                Convention of 1859 stipulates the construction of an easy
                                communication “between the fittest place on the Atlantic Coast near
                                the Settlement of Belize and the Capital of Guatemala,” that is to
                                say, in Guatemalan territory near the Sarstoon River: in his letter
                                of appreciation, Lord Russell asks details relative to the viewpoint
                                of Guatemala as to “the establishment of a line of communication,
                                between the Capital of the Republic and the Coast of the Atlantic at
                                or near Belize,” that is to say, in accordance with British
                                geographical nomenclature, at or near the port of Belize, capital of
                                “British Honduras.”</p>

                                the delays, pretexts and even offensive statements of the English

                                contains good evidence of such a pitiful controversy in which a
                                great power, protected by a certain impunity, has humiliated and
                                offended continually a weak nation which does not cease to demand
                                justice before the universal conscience.</p>
                            <p>Great Britain repudiated the compensatory clause of the treaty of
                                territorial cession of April 30, 1859; the latter, because of
                                non-compliance with the principal clause, has been void since that
                                time: the construction of the road, relative to which the English
                                Minister Mr. Mathew said, because of the unquestionable advantages
                                which it would bring to Guatemala, “the idea then of indirect
                                compensation, must be the main reason that leads Great Britain to
                                incur any expenditure in the matter” was the condition demanded by
                                the Republic, undoubtedly as indispensable, and it was so accepted
                                by Mr. Wyke in the name of his Government in a gentlemen’s pact.
                                This is a matter of transparent character and it is unnecessary to
                                resort to experts: Guatemala loyally delivered her territory of the
                                present Belize—obligated by the immensely superior force of Great
                                Britain and the acquiescence of her natural protector, the United
                                States—the Republic granted that title, the boundary Convention
                                which only Guatemala could grant, since “the regulation of the
                                frontier of British Honduras was to be <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0217"/>effected by negotiation with the Government of
                                Guatemala” (Mr. Cass, Secretary of State, to Lord Napier, British
                                Minister to the United States, November 8, 1858). (Manning, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, VII, 195) But, as an elementary
                                principle, in exchange for what she obtained England was obliged to
                                execute a material work which would give compensation in favor of
                                the nation obliged to cede.</p>
                            <p>Guatemala consented to her dismemberment, it must be repeated, under
                                the imponderable weight of the Anglo-United States agreement, and
                                the sacrifice which she accepted implied transcendency for the two
                                great nations: “It is of no small consequence either to the United
                                States or Great Britain, that these Central American controversies
                                between the two countries should be forever closed,” Mr. Cass states
                                in his note to Lord Napier mentioned in the preceding paragraph (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, VII, 200) and Mr. Wyke surely so
                                explained also to the Government of Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>Great Britain seemed to forget that the triumph of the English
                                Government over the Government of the defenseless Republic of
                                Guatemala had been attained in a diplomatic controversy with another
                                great power, in face of which the honor of Great Britain obligated
                                her to obtain the title indispensable to territorial sovereignty,
                                which, as a result of that diplomatic controversy, she had to take
                                from the Republic of Guatemala: the English Government, solemnly
                                obligated to reach a settlement with that of Guatemala, perfidiously
                                agreed to the compensatory clause demanded by the latter—and ceased
                                to honor its engagement as soon as its ambition was satisfied.</p>
                            <p>But before defenseless Guatemala, and precisely because of the
                                circumstances of the entire question, from its turbulent origin up
                                to the arrangement with the Government of the United States and the
                                Boundary Convention with Guatemala, is raised the shield of
                                universal justice and, above time and injustice, the imprescriptible
                                right of Guatemala is maintained undamaged.</p>
                            <p>Guatemala saw herself under the weight of overwhelming forces which
                                deprived her of freedom of action to consent to her territorial
                                dismemberment. It must be remembered what Great Britain was at the
                                middle of the XIX Century and how imposing her material force was at
                                that time. The rule of brute force was invincible and to violence
                                should be added the cleverness of her diplomacy and the lack of
                                scruples in taking control of the territories which she desired.
                                Guatemala signed the pact of 1859 subject to the engagement made by
                                Great Britain. For eighty years the victim has pleaded that the
                                powerful empire comply with her word and therewith the solemn
                                obligations which she contracted, and never has obtained more than
                                false promises and hard words until the scornful attitude of
                                Minister Birch reached its climax when he declared to the Government
                                of Guatemala in a solemn note, that “it would serve no useful
                                purpose to pursue the matter <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0218"/>further and that they have, therefore, no option but to treat the
                                present boundary of British Honduras … as constituting the correct
                                boundary.”</p>
                            <p>England ignored her contractual engagements and her solemn
                                obligations: broke the Convention of 1859 and depended upon her
                                strength to reject the just claims of Guatemala. It was impossible
                                for the Republic to continue in the attitude of passivity and
                                patience. She considered that she could do nothing against the
                                powerful empire, except accept the situation in which England had
                                placed herself and resort to the same reasons invoked by her! If
                                Great Britain ignored her obligations set forth in the Convention of
                                1859, she rendered that said international pact void; she had broken
                                and nullified it by her own hand; the Convention had ceased to
                                exist, by virtue of the juridical consequences which are deduced
                                from non-compliance with bilateral obligations by one of the
                                contracting parties. Now, Guatemala would no longer beg that England
                                do her the favor of paying her what she owed; now, she will no
                                longer ask for compliance with the Convention which England has
                                ignored and broken; today, Guatemala demands of the powerful British
                                Empire that matters return to the situation in which they were prior
                                to the Convention of 1859, and, consequently, the territory of
                                Belize must return to the sovereignty of Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>This firm resolution of the Government of Guatemala was expressed in
                                an absolutely clear and explicit manner by the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs to the new British Minister Mr. Leche in an official
                                conversation held after his reception by the President of the
                                Republic.</p>
                            <p>Guatemala is determined to make herself heard in the world. She will
                                resort to all the sources of justice; she will knock at the doors of
                                all Foreign Offices; she will ask for moral backing and the support
                                which the Governments of the States of America can give her; she
                                will invoke American solidarity and the principles which protect the
                                rights of this continent, proclaimed in the Conference of Buenos
                                Aires and ratified in the Declaration of Lima in 1938; in short, she

                            <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on making the juridical study of
                                the situation created by England, has been surprised by the virtual
                                unanimity of the doctrine sustained by internationalists of all
                                times and of all nations which render homage to the principles of
                                international right thereby affirming that the Convention of 1859
                                has ceased to exist. The bibliography which supports and backs the
                                resolution adopted by Guatemala is abundant and of great weight.

                                    <p>It must then be considered as a just motive to legalize
                                        suspension that the contracting party violate the treaty. It
                                        is in effect unquestionable that when one of the parties
                                        does not fulfill the obligations contracted, it places the
                                        other in the position of declaring itself freed from the
                                        obligation to comply with its (engagements). Hence, if the
                                        violation refer to the essence or to one of the more
                                        important points of the Treaty, the resolution thereof may
                                        be deduced therefrom. (Fiore, <hi rend="italic">Treaty of

                                    <p>What are the effects of a violation of treaty committed by
                                        one of the parties on the duration of the Treaty and its
                                        executive force? The two following proposals seem to be
                                        considered unquestionable and it is not necessary to show
                                        the exactitude by arguments: that is, first, the violation
                                        of the treaty does not free <hi rend="italic">ipso
                                            facto</hi> the party, who is to blame, from the
                                        obligation to execute subsequently the engagements
                                        contracted by it in virtue of these dispositions, as neither
                                        can take advantage of its own mistake; second, the violation
                                        of a treaty does not free <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi>
                                        and without express declaration on its part the other party,
                                        the party which is the victim, of the obligation contracted
                                        in virtue of the dispositions. The effect of a violation (of
                                        the kind which we are going to define) is only to give to
                                        the other party the right to put an end to the treaty in
                                        that which concerns its subsequent execution. If it does not
                                        make use of this faculty within a reasonable time, the right
                                        to exercise it disappears.</p>

                                    <p>In 1887, the Court of Claims of the United States declared in
                                        the case <hi rend="italic">Hooper</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic">United States</hi> that: a treaty in which the duration
                                        seems at first sight indefinite and which does not contain
                                        some provision relative to its termination, can be annulled
                                        by one of the parties under certain circumstances. By its
                                        nature, a treaty is a contract between nations. If the
                                        counter party does not comply, for example, or if some of
                                        the important provisions are violated by one of the parties,
                                        the other party has the right to declare the treaty
                                        terminated. The United States have sustained this thesis
                                        with regard to the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Mr. Frelinghuysen,
                                        who was Secretary of State at that time, wrote to Mr. Hall,
                                        Minister to Central America (July 19, 1884): “The United
                                        States have the right to declare lapsed the Clayton–Bulwer
                                        Treaty. The basis for this opinion has been fully proved, I
                                        believe, by the two following arguments. On the one hand,
                                        the counter party having not complied, the purpose of the
                                        treaty never having been realized, the United States nave
                                        not obtained the objects had in view by them when they
                                        concluded the treaty: on the other, Great Britain has
                                        violated in a persistent manner their engagements not to
                                        colonize the Central American coast. There are then clearly
                                        two reasons for annullment: noncompliance by the counter
                                        party and positive violation of the contract”. (Arnold D.

                                        does not <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> cancel the
                                        treaty; but it is within the discretion of the other party
                                        to cancel it on this ground. There is indeed no unanimity
                                        among writers on International Law in regard to this point,
                                        since some make a distinction between essential and
                                        non-essential stipulations of the treaty, and maintain that
                                        only violation of essential stipulations creates a right for
                                        the other party to cancel the treaty. Others oppose this
                                        distinction, maintaining that it is not always possible to
                                        distinguish essential from non-essential stipulations, that
                                        the binding force of a treaty protects non-essential as well
                                        as essential stipulations, and that it is for the faithful
                                        party to consider for itself whether violation of a treaty,
                                        even in its least essential parts, justifies its
                                        cancellation. The case, however, is different, when a treaty
                                        expressly stipulates that it should not be considered broken
                                        merely by violation of one or another part of it. (L.

                                        its turn, maintain that not only the supplementary
                                        convention of 1863 has expired, because of non-compliance by
                                        the other party, but also the treaty of 1859, and, in that

                                        would create a situation the opposite of the present one;
                                        that is to say, although therewith Guatemala would not
                                        receive what she understands belongs to her; she would make
                                        disappear in agreement with Great Britain, taking into
                                        consideration the unilateral declaration of the latter,
                                        which now exists, which, according to Guatemala, gave origin

                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">White Book</hi> explains the means employed by
                                Great Britain to leave unfulfilled her engagement; the Convention of
                                ‘59 fixed the English obligation to construct the highway from the
                                capital of the Republic to the Atlantic coast of the country,
                                without any conditional provision relative to cost, since that means
                                of communication, of unquestionable benefit for the country, was the
                                condition for the territorial cession. Nevertheless, the English
                                Government began alleging that the cost of £145,465, estimated by
                                Engineer Wray, was excessive: the pathetic Anglo-United States
                                discussion relative to huge world interests of the Caribbean came to
                                result, once the point in controversy between the two great powers
                                was eliminated, in the ridiculous haggling of a pound more or less
                                between Great Britain <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0221"/>and
                                Guatemala for the satisfaction of the engagement—solemn inasmuch as
                                it was set forth in a pact signed and ratified by the Government of
                                Her Britannic Majesty—contracted by the latter in favor of
                                Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>On August 5, 1863, the Republic had to sign the Convention of London,
                                in accordance with which the British engagement was reduced to the
                                payment of £50,000, in instalments of £10,000 based on the
                                construction by the Government of Guatemala, for their account, of
                                the aforesaid highway. The period for the exchange of ratifications
                                was fixed at six months counted from the signature of the Treaty.
                                Guatemala was involved in a war with her neighbors and, therefore,
                                the exchange of ratifications could not be made during the period
                                fixed. Great Britain alleged that the absence of the exchange during
                                the period fixed for that purpose had caused the Convention of 1863
                                to lapse, and, although the latter was only supplementary to that of
                                1859, the English Government claimed that simultaneously they were
                                exonerated from their compensatory engagement to which clause seven
                                of the document of territorial cession refers, but, of course for
                                London, the territorial acquisition which that compensation was to
                                indemnify remained in full force.</p>
                            <p>With incredible ingenuity, the English statesmen thought that the
                                nonratification of the secondary pact would leave ineffective the
                                obligation <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>, the price for what
                                was obtained by means of the principal pact. It is elementary
                                reasoning that, when the clause of modification of any perfect
                                international pact does not come into force, matters return to the
                                former status, to be governed precisely in accordance with the
                                treaty which did not come to be modified. This was the jurisprudence
                                invoked by the Government of the United States when the
                                Dallas-Clarendon Treaty was inapplicable due to the modifications by
                                Congress relative to the proposed dismemberment of Honduras and
                                Nicaragua. The Secretary of State, Mr. Cass, informed the British

                                of State, in 1882 to Mr. Lowell, Minister to England: “Great Britain
                                is under the same rigid restriction. And if Great Britain has
                                violated and continues to violate that provision, the treaty is, of
                                course, voidable at the pleasure of the United States”. To the
                                arguments of Great Britain which, in the transaction with the United

                                engagement—the Secretary of State replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>The treaty was voidable at the option of the United States.
                                        This, I think, has been demonstrated fully on two grounds.
                                        First, that the consideration of the treaty having failed,
                                        its object never having been accomplished, the United States
                                        did not receive that for which they covenanted; and second,
                                        that Great Britain has persistently violated her agreement
                                        not to colonize the Central American coast. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, III, 197.)</p>

                            <p>This was the opinion maintained by the Republic from the very moment
                                when the English Government, abusing their privileged position, and

                                the compensatory clause. In face of the impossibility of a direct
                                understanding with the Government of London, the Government of
                                Guatemala stated her rights and opinions before the Government of
                                the United States and, as in 1835, left on record the energetic
                                reservation of its rights: in a communication of December, 1872, the

                                Granville, English Secretary for State, declared on August 18, 1880
                                to the Guatemalan Plenipotentiary that “Her Majesty’s Government
                                adhere to the views expressed in the note addressed to His
                                Excellency señor don Juan de Francisco Martin by the Earl of
                                Clarendon on November 15, 1869, and that they cannot admit that
                                there is any ground for submitting the question to arbitration”.
                                That is to say, the review of the reasonings of the powerful, which
                                having mocked the good faith of the weak, felt itself protected by
                                perfect impunity in unfair conduct in negotiations between nations
                                or individuals. Lord Stanley had given the Minister of Guatemala, on
                                August 29, 1866, the formula agreeable to Her Britannic Majesty’s

                                        between whom the engagements to construct it were entered

                                        other hand they take a different view, it will be for them

                            <p>During the course of the entire controversy, the English statesmen
                                persisted obstinately in such an ingenuous formula, which logically
                                must be interpreted as follows: with the bait of the road, from
                                which the Republic was to obtain “unquestionable advantages” England
                                obtained title to dominion over Belize and, when the despoliation
                                had been consummated, and in view of the fact that England refused
                                to comply with her word, by mutual agreement the two parties were to
                                abandon the payment of the compensation! Lord Stanley was clever
                                when he revealed that the discussion would be terminated in this
                                manner. But the Government of Guatemala, in the light of absolutely
                                Anglo-Saxon logic, gave instructions to their Plenipotentiary, who,
                                on April 5, 1884, made the following statement to Lord Granville:

                                        solution. In fact: either the treaty of 1859 is in force or
                                        it has lapsed. If it is in force, nothing prevents the two
                                        Governments from proceeding with its execution, and in this
                                        case Your Excellency will recognize the advantage of
                                        interpreting Article 7 in its most practical sense. If the
                                        treaty has lapsed, matters shall return to their former
                                        status, and consequently, the two contracting parties will
                                        be released from the obligations which they then contracted.
                                        But what the Government of Guatemala cannot accept and does
                                        not accept, is that the consent favorable to Great Britain,
                                        granted by it in Article 1 of the Treaty of 1859 remains in
                                        force, so long as the compensatory articles are not

                                stipulation of the second article of the Convention of 1859. They
                                fixed the posts at Gracias a Dios Falls on the River Sarstoon and at
                                Gar-butt’s Falls on the Belize: when this was done, that is to say,
                                British possession assured by means of the fixing of the two

                                western boundary “the British commissioner received orders from his

                                between Belize and Guatemala, until he received new instructions”
                                reads the Engineers’ report.</p>
                            <p>Great Britain was in possession of the Guatemalan territory, exactly
                                as her caprice desired, and at the same time, without marking the
                                land frontier, the Guatemalan forest was open to the plundering of
                                the English wood cutters and a cloak for the smugglers, who, far
                                from the fiscal authorities, were at liberty to introduce their
                                illicit commerce by the frontier of Peten to the heart of the
                                country.</p>
                            <p>It is not pertinent to go into explanations in this respect. Let it
                                suffice to say that the Plenipotentiary of Great Britain before the
                                Government of Guatemala, Mr. John Henry Stopford Birch, in his note
                                of November 13, 1934, offered the Government of Guatemala, as a
                                magnanimous concession, that “if the Guatemalan Government should
                                remove the existing ban on the export of produce from Peten through
                                British Honduras and should refrain in the future from imposing
                                vexatious administrative barriers … His Majesty’s Government are
                                prepared to cooperate as far as possible with the Guatemalan
                                Government with a view to the suppression of contraband activities
                                on the frontier”. These were the activities to which the Minister of
                                Guatemala in his note of 1872 to the Secretary of State of the
                                United States referred.</p>
                            <p>In the spirit of conciliation which is only understandable in the
                                traditional foreign policy of all the Governments of Guatemala, the
                                Republic sought, on all the occasions offered, the manner of seeing
                                if it were possible to attain some settlement with the English
                                Government within the spirit of the Convention of 1859, even though
                                this had lapsed from the moment when Great Britain repudiated its
                                compensatory clause.</p>
                            <p>And so, when on February 21, 1933 the British Minister asked if the
                                Government of Guatemala “would be willing to appoint Guatemalan
                                engineers to examine a demarcation of the frontier to be carried out
                                unilaterally by British engineers”, the Secretary for Foreign
                                Affairs replied on March 4, that, under instructions of the
                                President of the Republic, he informed him that this Government
                                desired to know before replying whether the Government of His
                                Britannic Majesty, “in compliance with the Convention of April 30,
                                1859 would be prepared to put into due effect the bilateral
                                stipulations contained in Article 7 of said Convention”.</p>
                            <p>On the 25th of the same month of March, the English representative
                                stated in an “urgent” note, that “the question of Article VII of the
                                Convention of 30th April 1859 will be carefully examined by His
                                Majesty’s Government and that instructions upon the subject will be
                                sent me in due course”. Naturally His Majesty’s Government presumed
                                    <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0226"/>“that it is not the

                                Representative requested “at the earliest possible moment Your
                                Excellency’s reply to my note under reference in order that that
                                reply may be regarded as placing on record the understanding arrived

                                of British Honduras and the Republic of Guatemala by British

                                tone, as if blaming on the Government of the Republic the lack of

                                Government confess that they failed their word given in the

                                agreed upon, of which the English Minister Mr. Mathew said on June
                                29, 1862, that “the advantages, which Guatemala will derive from the
                                road, by opening a vast district of rich country, are
                                unquestionable”. The railway to which Mr. Lee refers was opened in
                                1909, and consequently for a half a century the Republic was
                                deprived of the advantages recognized by Mr. Mathew.</p>
                            <p>But even if Guatemala had constructed, without the sacrifices which
                                it has cost her, her railway in the year of 1859, the claim of the
                                party guilty of violation of the contractual pact that if the
                                injured party proceeds at his own cost to repair the damage suffered
                                by him, the transgressor is exonerated from responsibility, is truly
                                unusual! It can be taken for granted without fear of error, that no
                                English tribunal—international or ordinary—would seriously consider
                                such jurisprudence. And still less what is insinuated in the
                                following paragraph of Mr. Lee’s note: for Great Britain to satisfy
                                the compensation which, if the Convention of 1859 were in force, she
                                would owe to <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0228"/>Guatemala for
                                the territorial cession of Belize, that compensation “would have to
                                benefit the Colony of Belize!” This atrocity was defined by the
                                Minister Mr. Birch in his note of November 13, 1934: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>I am now instructed to put forward, as demonstration of the
                                        good will of His Majesty’s Government towards the Guatemalan
                                        Government, and as their contribution towards the settlement
                                        of the above question, the following proposal which, after
                                        the most careful study of the economic considerations,
                                        appears to His Majesty’s Government to be the only one which
                                        can satisfy the above requirements. His Majesty’s Government
                                        propose that the Government of British Honduras should
                                        construct a road from Belize to the frontier of Peten and
                                        that the necessary continuation on the Guatemalan side
                                        should be constructed by the Guatemalan Government.</p>

                     </p>
                            <p>The “careful study of the economic considerations” must have referred
                                to the precarious economic situation of the Colony, consequent to
                                the energetic suppression of smuggling exercised by the Government
                                of Guatemala, aggravated by the circumstance that the aerial
                                communication between the capital of the Republic and the towns in
                                transit, in fact decreased the commerce in transit and the movement
                                of travellers by the port of Belize: the extensive department of
                                Peten was strangled, without a direct exit to the sea due to the
                                British dismemberment of Guatemalan territory. And so, according to
                                the English Government, the compensation due the Republic from His
                                Britannic Majesty’s Government would have to be diverted from its
                                intimate character to favor exclusively His Majesty’s possessions.
                                It is, in reality, a strange manner to give satisfaction to the
                                wishes of Guatemala. And furthermore, in his above mentioned note,
                                Minister Birch added that His Majesty’s Government considered “as an
                                essential condition to his proposal, that the Guatemalan Government
                                should remove the existing ban on the export of produce from Peten
                                through British Honduras and should refrain in the future from
                                imposing vexatious administrative barriers.” And in the same
                                paragraph, the magnanimous promise in exchange for the elimination
                                of the customs tariffs for Belize: “At the same time, I am to inform
                                Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to
                                cooperate as far as possible with the Guatemalan Government with a
                                view to the suppression of contraband activities on the
                                frontier”.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Guatemala did not weaken in its extreme spirit of
                                conciliation and, taking into account the antecedents of this
                                unfortunate affair, made the minimum contra-proposals of a modesty
                                excessive, only conceivable in the desire of obtaining, although by
                                means of the renunciation of the most legitimate claims, some legal
                                formula which, with a very reduced advantage for the Republic, would
                                give the impression that within the canons of the international
                                family <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0229"/>the dignity of
                                Guatemala had received, on the part of Great Britain, the
                                consideration which by no concept has she ceased to deserve.</p>
                            <p>But the Republic had consented, in 1859, to be the propitiatory
                                victim on the altars of English ambition, and this unfortunate
                                memory only serves as a stimulant to the arrogant injustice of the
                                Government of London: no proposal could be satisfactory to them,
                                they were determined not to comply with their engagements, but, on
                                the contrary, to attain new advantages at the cost of Guatemala.</p>
                            <p>In the impossibility of reaching any direct adjustment whatever, the
                                Government again proposed, as a last recourse, arbitration—and
                                suggested as arbitrator His Excellency Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
                                President of the United States: His Majesty’s Government accepted in
                                principle, but according to the note signed by Lord Halifax of
                                August 17, 1937: “they are unable to agree that the arbitrator
                                should be the President of the United States. They could, in fact,
                                only accept arbitration in this case by the Permanent Court of
                                International Justice at The Hague”.</p>
                            <p>Lord Halifax deemed it unnecessary “to explain that this decision is
                                not based on any objection of principle to a single arbitrator in a
                                suitable case, still less to the President of the United States
                                individually”.</p>

                                <p>It rests rather on the conviction that The Hague Court is the
                                    proper tribunal to decide such a case as the present. The
                                    reasons for this view are as follows. The issues in the present
                                    case are essentially of a legal character involving difficult
                                    questions of law and interpretation which could not
                                    satisfactorily be decided by any tribunal other than a legal
                                    tribunal of high standing, and of all possible legal tribunals
                                    The Hague Court by reason of the authority of its judges and the
                                    length and nature of its experience is, in the opinion of His
                                    Majesty’s Government, by far the most suitable to decide a
                                    question of this kind. Moreover it has been the invariable
                                    practice of His Majesty’s Government to make use of the
                                    machinery of The Hague Court wherever possible, for the
                                    settlement of international disputes, save in cases where
                                    special considerations warrant a different course, and they see
                                    no sufficient reason for a departure from this practice in the
                                    present case.</p>

                                        caused Guatemala, other than the material loss, intangible
                                        injuries of a different character which can be proved by
                                        reading the copious correspondence sustained by the two

                                        because the disagreement, subject of arbitration, refers to
                                        something different than the mere legal interpretation of

                                    <p>It is not a question of deciding merely juridical issues
                                        which involve questions of law and interpretation, and the
                                        Government of Guatemala is convinced that that of His
                                        Britannic Majesty, animated by the most ample and elevated
                                        spirit, will take into consideration this viewpoint. The
                                        Government of Guatemala must express first the profound
                                        respect and consideration which it has for the Permanent
                                        Court of International Justice at The Hague, the competency
                                        and integrity of which are beyond discussion; but, at the
                                        same time, it considers it necessary to set forth its
                                        conviction that the questions at issue are not only of a
                                        juridical order and therefore depart from the somewhat rigid
                                        regulations of that tribunal which is exclusively <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> with strict legal rules to
                                        which it must adhere in its decisions.</p>
                                    <p>And since His Excellency Lord Halifax declares that the
                                        disagreement of His Majesty’s Government as to the
                                        arbitrator proposed is not based precisely on objections of
                                        principle to a single arbitrator—and still less to His
                                        Excellency President Roosevelt—in the most courteous manner
                                        I request Your Excellency to take into account the

                                        high sense of justice the regret with which the Government
                                        of Guatemala declines to accept the Permanent Court of
                                        International Justice at The Hague, because for the pending
                                        case it does not have ample jurisdiction to consider

                                        much as does that of Guatemala.</p>

                                        invariable practice of His Majesty’s Government to make use
                                        of the Court at The Hague, whenever possible, for the
                                        settlement of international disputes; but indicates also the
                                        exception of cases in which special considerations warrant a
                                        different procedure.</p>
                                    <p>This latter consideration of the Foreign Office and the

                                        be so kind as to reconsider its suggestion of the Court at
                                        The Hague, and will agree to His Excellency the President of

                                        to remove all possible points of frictions <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0231"/>between Guatemala and the
                                        United Kingdom, His Majesty’s Government have spared no
                                        effort throughout the period of the dispute to find a means
                                        of implementing Article VII of the Anglo-Guatemalan
                                        Convention of 1859 in a manner acceptable to the Guatemalan
                                        Government. They are consequently unable to assume any
                                        responsibility for the failure of their attempts to reach a
                                        settlement satisfactory to all concerned. As regards the
                                        question of the non-ratification of the Anglo-Guatemalan
                                        Convention of 1863, to which your note makes special
                                        reference, I am directed to remind Your Excellency that, as
                                        has been pointed out at previous stages of the controversy,
                                        her then Majesty’s Government were ready and willing to
                                        proceed to ratification in due time, and that it was solely
                                        owing to the attitude of the Guatemalan Government that the
                                        Convention never entered into force.</p>
                                    <p>In your note under reply, Your Excellency points out that the
                                        Guatemalan Government are unable to accept the proposal
                                        formulated in the second paragraph of the letter addressed
                                        by Lord Halifax to Doctor Matos on the 17th August, 1937, to
                                        the effect that the present problem should be submitted for
                                        arbitration to the Permanent Court of International Justice
                                        of The Hague. His Majesty’s Government for their part remain
                                        of the opinion that the issue is essentially legal in
                                        character, and for this reason regret that they cannot see
                                        their way to reconsider their attitude in the sense desired
                                        by the Guatemalan Government.</p>
                                    <p>In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government consider that
                                        it would serve no useful purpose to pursue the matter
                                        further and that they have, therefor, no option but to treat
                                        the present boundary of British Honduras, which they have
                                        every reason to regard as being entirely in accordance with
                                        the provisions of the Anglo-Guatemalan Convention of 1859,
                                        as constituting the correct boundary. They must, moreover,
                                        disclaim all responsibility for incidents which may arise
                                        from any failure by the Guatemalan Government to observe the
                                        boundary.</p>

                            <p>The note of the English Minister could not do less than radically
                                change the attitude of the Government of Guatemala: the discussion
                                having returned to the point where it had rested in 1884, when the
                                Minister of Guatemala in London presented the dilemma of integral
                                compliance with the Convention or its caducity, the Government of
                                Guatemala had to repeat its energetic protest and reiterate
                                concretely its reservations. It is clear that, as Minister Birch
                                said in his note of November 13 to the Secretary for Foreign
                                Affairs, circumstances have radically changed because of the 116
                                years of illegal possession on the part of Great Britain of the
                                Anglo-Spanish Belize of 1786 and the 80 years of usurpation of the
                                additional districts to which the lapsed Anglo-Guatemalan Boundary
                                Convention of 1859 refers. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs stated
                                in his note of March 9, 1938: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>In reply, I have the honor to call Your Excellency’s
                                        attention to the circumstances that the Government of
                                        Guatemala in its correspondence of recent years with that
                                        Honorable Legation has constantly invited His Majesty’s
                                        Government to consider the absolute necessity of giving due
                                        compliance to Article VTI of the Convention, because, <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0232"/>that Article being
                                        the only one of the pact which sets forth obligations to it
                                        in exchange for the advantages obtained, non-compliance with
                                        that compensatory clause, will necessarily invalidate the
                                        Articles which favor Great Britain. Whatever may have been
                                        His Majesty’s Government’s reasons for not ratifying the
                                        Convention of 1863, it is an undeniable fact that, in
                                        rejecting the agreement of modification of the obligations
                                        which Article VII of that of 59 imposes on it, the British
                                        Government reiterated the recognition of said obligation,
                                        agreed upon by it in negotiating and signing the pact and in
                                        ratifying it, as well as in considering and proposing the
                                        modification of the clause of its obligation.</p>
                                    <p>The Government of Guatemala believes itself firmly assisted
                                        in this matter by the Law of Nations, and in face of the
                                        declaration that His Majesty’s Government—deeming it useless
                                        to consider the Guatemalan viewpoint—decides to set aside
                                        the obligations solemnly contracted in a perfect
                                        international pact, the Government of Guatemala renews its
                                        demand for integral compliance with the Convention of 1859,
                                        maintains the reservation of its rights, and rejects
                                        responsibilities for the consequences of non-compliance with
                                        a treaty, respect for which has been continuously solicited
                                        precisely by the Government of Guatemala.</p>

                            <p>Such is the character of the controversy which Guatemala sustains
                                against Great Britain: at the time of the independence of the
                                Republic, in 1821, the usufructuary privileges granted by the King
                                of Spain to English subjects between the Sibun, Belize, Nuevo and
                                Hondo Rivers, belonging to the jurisdiction of Guatemala,
                                ceased,—and the English Government, although pretending to be a
                                friend of the new State, in spite of the latter’s protests and by
                                means of the abuse of force, continued in the illegal possession of
                                the territories of the Spanish concessions.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Guatemala resorted in 1835, to an appeal for the
                                aid of the Government of the United States to bring about the
                                evacuation by the Government of England of the territories which
                                they illegally held, or at least while the question of right was
                                being discussed, that His Majesty’s subjects cease the depredations
                                to which they resorted beyond the demarcation of the Anglo-Spanish
                                concessions: in a memorable session of the Congress of the United
                                States, at the beginning of 1853, the abuse of Great Britain and the
                                complete sovereignty of Guatemala over all the territory in dispute
                                were proved without a doubt.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, by the Dallas–Clarendon Treaty (1856) the Governments
                                of the United States and of Great Britain without the knowledge and
                                moreover, without the consent of the Government of Guatemala, agreed
                                that Great Britain should seize upon five times the territorial
                                extension of the English occupation, and in the form of a boundary
                                treaty obtain from the Republic the legal title necessary to give an
                                honest appearance to the violations of the Monroe Doctrine and the
                                Clayton–Bulwer Convention which this dismemberment signified. And so
                                the defenceless Republic was handed over to the discretion <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0233"/>of Great Britain, and
                                Guatemala had to sign the boundary treaty in accordance with the
                                pleasure and taste of the English plenipotentiary.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, and since right is manifested even under the worst
                                circumstances, Great Britain, in face of the impossibility of
                                obtaining the legal title which the United States demanded during
                                the course of the prolonged Anglo–United States controversy relative
                                to Central American affairs, of which Belize formed the principal
                                part, the English Plenipotentiary was obliged to consent to the
                                compensatory clause, perfectly defined by English diplomats, as has
                                been seen in this memorandum.</p>
                            <p>The English Government, in spite of having ratified said compensatory
                                clause, as soon as they had consummated the occupation of Belize,
                                repudiated compliance with their engagement, and, upon declaring
                                invalid the article of compensation, caused the entire pact of
                                territorial cession, mistakenly called a boundary part, to lapse.
                                Here originated, since 1862, the 80 year old controversy, for whose
                                just solution the Government of the United States have offered their
                                friendly mediation in the Memorandum of June 8, 1938, now under
                                reply.</p>
                            <p>As in 1835, in December of 1872, the Plenipotentiary of Guatemala
                                stated to the Government of the United States that England had
                                caused the caducity of the boundary Convention of 1859, and that
                                Guatemala, in the material impossibility of securing immediate
                                justice, reserved her rights for an opportune occasion; the Minister
                                of Guatemala made similar declarations before the Government of
                                London in 1884.</p>
                            <p>In the course of this memorandum, the Government of Guatemala has
                                reviewed the entire history of the question, examined in the light
                                of the opinion of prominent public men of the United States: the
                                Republic no longer need to await the moment when the Government of
                                the United States, natural defender of right and justice in the
                                Western Hemisphere—and the circumstances which in 1856 obliged it to
                                consent to the dismemberment of the weak American Republic by a
                                great European power—now being changed—will use its unquestionable
                                authority to make Great Britain return to Guatemala the territory
                                which she usurped, and indemnify her for the damages resulting from
                                that usurpation, not the least of which are the smuggling carried on
                                by British subjects and the undue exploitation of the forest of
                                Peten.</p>
                            <p>Great Britain is involved now in an armed conflict for the defense,
                                so say her statesmen, of the sanctity of International Treaties;
                                this is an opportune occasion to prove with acts the validity of the
                                English ideal.</p>

                        <p>30. Accompanied by Consul General Davis and Luis Fiore<note n="2" xml:id="d266fn2">Prominent Argentine businessman who frequently
                                acted as an adviser to the Minister of Finance.</note> I called on
                            Groppo, Minister of Finance, this morning. I went straight to the point
                            and told him that during the visit to Buenos Aires of Fowler and
                                Sappington<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">By instructions of November
                                29, 1938, William A. Fowler, Assistant Chief of the Division of
                                Trade Agreements, and James C. Sappington III, of the same Division,
                                were directed to proceed to Buenos Aires and Montevideo to discuss
                                trade relations with officials in those capitals (611.3531/692b and
                                /692a).</note> a confidential memorandum had been prepared which in
                            our opinion might form the basis for the negotiation of a trade
                            agreement between Argentina and the United States. I said that the
                            contents of this memorandum were known to the experts of the Ministry of
                            Finance and that we had been led to believe that its provisions had
                            aroused their sympathetic interest. I added that we were grateful for
                            the facilities which had been afforded by the Government to Fowler and
                            Sappington in forming their contacts and that an expression of his
                            opinion of the memorandum would be appreciated. The Minister replied
                            that he had familiarized himself with the contents of the memorandum and
                            that it was his intention to instruct his experts to prepare a reply
                            thereto. While at first he showed a tendency to speak with some heat of
                            matters extraneous to the issue and to revert to their past grievances,
                            he ultimately declared that he was a realist in the matter and was
                            prepared to give thoughtful consideration to practical issues.</p>
                        <p>He declared to begin with that he recognized the need for a trade
                            agreement, spoke disparagingly of Argentina’s trade relations with
                            Germany, intimating that while the Germans were promising big things at
                            present, we could never tell what the future held in store. Furthermore
                            that in his opinion the two countries to which Argentina should look for
                            the betterment of its economic situation were Great <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0236"/>Britain and the United States. At this
                            point Davis reminded him that the situation today with respect to trade
                            relations between the United States and Great Britain differed
                            materially from that of 1933. To this the Minister expressed lively
                            agreement and added he saw no insuperable obstacle in the way but on the
                            contrary, given the possibility of tariff concessions, including canned
                            meat, he saw no reason why an agreement on the basis of the memorandum
                            should not be possible.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion he said that he would consult with Louro<note n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">Alfredo Louro, Chief of Argentine Exchange Control
                                Board.</note> and Prebisch<note n="5" xml:id="d266fn5">Raul
                                Prebisch, General Manager, Central Bank of Argentina.</note> and
                            that he would then arrange another meeting with us at an early date
                            probably on Tuesday or Wednesday next.</p>

                            <item>Our commercial relations with Argentina have reached a highly
                                critical stage. For reasons presently to be indicated, a decision
                                regarding them must be reached promptly. This decision is one of
                                first importance since it will influence the future course of our
                                commercial and political relations with Argentina for years to come
                                and is bound to influence for better or for worse our political and
                                economic relations with Uruguay and the American Republics

                            <item>The Argentine Government is at present drastically curtailing
                                imports of United States products into Argentina, on a bilateral
                                basis, while imports from the United Kingdom, Germany and many other
                                countries, on the same basis, remain free of restrictions. The
                                existing Argentine system of controlling imports on a bilateral,
                                country basis plays into the hands of Great Britain, which has
                                forced exchange advantages from Argentina under threat of cutting
                                down purchases of fresh meat from that country, and also of Germany
                                and other totalitarian countries which can give commitments to
                                purchase specified amounts of Argentine products, particularly fresh
                                meat.</item>

                            <item>Officers of this Department who recently discussed the matter
                                thoroughly with Argentine officials in Buenos Aires came back with
                                the firm conviction that those officials are by no means satisfied
                                with the present bilateral system and that they would welcome
                                eagerly an opportunity to lessen Argentina’s dependence on European
                                markets and obtain release from the conditions imposed by those
                                countries. <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0237"/>The disruptive
                                effects of severe import restrictions on the bilateral basis,
                                particularly the recent restrictions on imports from the United
                                States, have caused a rising tide of criticism, on the part of
                                interested business men and the press in Argentina, which has placed
                                the Minister of Finance and other high officials on the defensive.
                                Because of Argentina’s large dependence upon the United Kingdom
                                market, Argentina has in the past been forced to yield to British
                                pressure for exchange preference, which makes Argentina feel that it
                                is being treated as a colonial market. With reference to this
                                situation an Argentine official is reported to have remarked that
                                “Argentina would like to regain her sovereignty”. In the case of
                                exports to Germany and certain Other European markets, there is not
                                only the possibility of expansion but also the constant danger of
                                arbitrary reduction of purchases from Argentina. Furthermore, in
                                those cases in which the proceeds from the sale of Argentine exports
                                can be spent only in the importing country, Argentine buyers are not
                                free to make their purchases where they can do so to the best
                                advantage. Argentine officials are worried now about how accumulated
                                blocked marks can be utilized.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>Argentine officials feel that Argentina’s only hope of breaking
                                away from dependence upon European markets lies in the possibility
                                of substantially increased trade with the United States. However,
                                they are aware of, and naturally tend to exaggerate, the danger to
                                which Argentina’s export trade with Europe would be exposed if
                                Argentina should break away from its bilateral commitments. It is
                                very largely for this reason that we shall have to hold out to
                                Argentine officials the prospect of really substantial tariff
                                concessions if we are to expect them to risk endangering Argentina’s
                                exports to Europe.</item>

                            <item>The foregoing explains the real interest of Argentine officials in
                                an agreement with the United States, on our multilateral basis,
                                provided we could offer concessions which they would consider
                                sufficient. That they are genuinely interested has been confirmed by
                                reports from the Embassy and Consulate General at Buenos Aires, and
                                through the press, since the officers of the Department referred to
                                above left Buenos Aires on January 21, 1939. Among other things,
                                these reports indicate that the Argentine authorities are awaiting
                                with keen interest proposals from this Government along the lines
                                discussed with them by officers of this Department.</item>

                        The Trade Agreements Committee within the last few days has
                                    again examined the whole situation and is impressed with the
                                    opportunity now presented to bring about a reorientation of
                                    Argentina’s trade policy. The Committee realizes that extensive
                                    concessions will have to be offered Argentina to bring this
                                    about, but not greater concessions than were previously
                                    recommended by it as entirely justifiable on economic grounds.
                                    The Committee’s recommendations when previously submitted were
                                    not all approved, it not being clear at that <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0238"/>time how far it would be
                                    necessary to go in order to obtain an agreement. Recent
                                    conversations with Argentine officials leave no room for doubt
                                    that if this important objective is to be attained it will be
                                    necessary to make concessions such as those recommended by the
                                    Trade Agreements Committee.</item></list>

                            <item>… Recent discussions with the Argentine authorities have made it
                                clear that any customs quotas, however liberal, would be
                                unacceptable. They emphasized in this connection, as they did on
                                other occasions, that we are proposing that they run the risk of
                                losing part of their export trade with Europe by entering into a
                                trade agreement on our basis. In order to justify such a radical
                                change in their trade policy, involving danger to their European
                                trade, they strongly feel that they must be able to say that in the
                                case of the United States, in contrast to Europe, no limitations are

                            <item>If our efforts to bring about a reorientation of Argentina’s
                                commercial policy are to succeed, we must move forward without
                                delay. We are informed by Argentine officials that the Argentine
                                Government will begin discussions with the British in March or April
                                relative to the question of renewal of their trade agreement with
                                the United Kingdom which could be terminated at the end of this
                                year. If, in advance of these discussions, the Argentine authorities
                                become convinced that a trade agreement with us offers real prospect
                                of compensation for any possible loss of exports to the United
                                Kingdom, the discussions with the British could lead to a
                                termination of Argentina’s virtual commitment to accord preferential
                                exchange treatment to British goods. If we do not shortly so
                                convince the Argentine authorities, their agreement with the United
                                Kingdom doubtless will be renewed on the present basis, probably for
                                another three years, and thus postpone indefinitely and beyond the
                                life of the present grant of authority to negotiate trade
                                agreements, an agreement with the United States on our basis.</item>

                            <item>The question before us now is not the question of the timing of
                                public notice of intention to negotiate; it is the question of
                                finding a basis for eventual negotiations. After we have reached
                                agreement on the basis, we can consider the question of the timing
                                of the announcement of negotiations.</item>

                            <item>The conclusion of an agreement with Argentina, on the basis of
                                full equality of treatment, would have the most far-reaching
                                benefits both in its trade and political aspects. It would mean a
                                significant change of policy by Argentina, the foremost Latin
                                American exponent of bilateralism. It would end the preferential
                                position enjoyed by the British in Argentina for the past six years
                                and would discourage German trading methods in Argentina. Uruguay, a
                                country which <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0239"/>has been
                                following bilateralistic policies to the detriment of our trade,
                                would undoubtedly follow Argentina’s lead. Furthermore, an agreement
                                with Argentina would have a beneficial effect upon the other
                                Republics in this hemisphere, a number of which are either
                                practicing or tending towards bilateralism.</item>

                                obtain advantages for our trade in Argentina. The alternative to
                                finding a basis for a trade agreement is a trade war. The situation
                                would not remain static but would become worse. In view of the
                                present serious and obvious discriminations against our trade and
                                the fact that these discriminations would become even greater if our
                                efforts to find a remedy should not succeed, failure to suspend the
                                application of trade-agreement benefits to Argentina (and Uruguay)
                                would constitute a glaring disregard of the generalization policy
                                laid down by the Congress in the Trade Agreements Act.<note n="6" xml:id="d267fn6">Approved June 12, 1934; 48 Stat 943.</note>
                                Trade warfare with Argentina (and Uruguay) would be a severe blow to
                                the good neighbor policy, the repercussions of which would be felt
                                throughout Latin America, and would tend to throw Argentina (and
                                Uruguay) permanently into the totalitarian, bilateral trade,

                        <p>Mr. Welles and I saw the President this afternoon at 3:15 concerning the
                            cotton export subsidy proposal and also concerning the Argentine trade
                            agreement. Regarding the latter, we outlined to the President the
                            critical situation now existing with respect to our trade in the
                            Argentine and briefly described the existing situation. Mr. Welles said
                            that he wanted to ask the President’s help in making possible the
                            negotiation of a trade agreement. I said that the wisest plan would be
                            not to make any public announcement of negotiations until about July
                            first but, in the meantime, to enter into confidential conversations
                            with the Argentine Government in order to find a sound basis for
                            negotiations. I suggested that we would then probably be able to
                            conclude the negotiations in September or October. The President replied
                            that he felt that would be too late and that the agreement should be
                            concluded in August.</p>
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0240"/>
                        <p>I showed the President the proposed concessions as outlined in the
                            memorandum dated February 18, 1939 covering canned beef, pickled and
                            cured beef, cattle hides, corn and edible and inedible tallow, oleo oil
                            and oleo stearin. The President agreed to these except that as to canned
                            beef he suggested that we find some way of classifying the canned beef
                            into several grades and giving the concession on those grades which are
                            almost entirely supplied to the United States from the Argentine but
                            which are not produced in the United States. I explained to him that a
                            general concession in canned beef was fully justified on economic
                            grounds and he replied that in spite of this it would be necessary to
                            have some trimmings to prevent complaint that we were giving away our
                            market to Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The President also said that for similar reasons he hoped we would be
                            able to impose a quota on canned beef.</p>
                        <p>The President promised to speak to Secretary Wallace<note n="8" xml:id="d268fn8">Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture.</note>
                            about the trade agreement tomorrow and tell him that he, the President,
                            desires a trade agreement with Argentina.</p>

                        <p>106. In pursuance of the trade-agreement discussions in Buenos Aires and
                            in accordance with the procedure generally followed in trade-agreement
                            conversation?, this Government now desires to ascertain what concessions
                            the Argentine Government would expect in return for negotiating a trade
                            agreement on our basis. As a result of exhaustive study of all products
                            of which Argentina is the chief or an important supplier to the United
                            States, this Government is fully prepared to give consideration to any
                            request, within the authority of the Trade Agreements Act, which the
                            Argentine Government may wish to make in regard to the tariff treatment
                            of such products. A memorandum in this sense, which embodies this
                            Government’s proposed basis for a trade agreement (which is in line with
                            the Fowler-Sapping-ton suggestions), is being sent you by air mail for
                            transmission to the Argentine Government.<note n="9" xml:id="d269fn9">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a memorandum with
                            enclosures embodying certain considerations and questions in regard to
                            the basis for a possible trade agreement with Argentina. You should,
                            unless you perceive objection, present this memorandum and enclosures to
                            the Argentine Foreign Minister<note n="10" xml:id="d270fn10">José M.
                                Cantilo.</note> as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the proposed basis for a trade agreement embodied
                            in the memorandum is in line with the suggestions, with respect to the
                            basis for a trade agreement, made to members of the Argentine
                            interministerial committee and to other Argentine officials by officers
                            of the Department during conversations in Buenos Aires. The memorandum
                            contemplates the negotiation of a trade agreement under which, from its
                            effective date, the Argentine Government would accord full equality of
                            treatment to United States trade, as provided in the proposed general
                            provisions, and tariff treatment as indicated for United States
                            products. It is desired to ascertain what concessions the Argentine
                            Government would expect in return for according this treatment to United
                            States trade under an agreement.</p>
                        <p>This Government does not envisage the negotiation of a conditional
                            agreement or an agreement, such as suggested by Dr. Raul Prebisch
                            (despatch no. 291 of February 24, 1939, from the Consul General<note n="11" xml:id="d270fn11">Not printed.</note>), which would provide
                            for a transitional period during which the Argentine Government could
                            take such steps as might be necessary in order to accord United States
                            trade equality of treatment. This should be made clear to the Foreign
                            Minister and to other appropriate Argentine officials. You should inform
                            such officials that this Government does not desire to negotiate an
                            agreement of that nature and could not consider granting substantial
                            concessions to Argentina for less in return on the part of Argentina
                            than is contemplated by the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>You should inform the appropriate Argentine officials that the Department
                            is informing the Argentine Ambassador in Washington that, in the event
                            the Argentine Government is inclined to agree to the proposed basis but

                            <p>The Government of the United States, in pursuance of conversations in
                                Washington between officers of the Department of State of the United
                                States and the Ambassador of Argentina and in Buenos Aires between
                                officers of the Department of State of the United States and
                                officials of the Government of Argentina, desires to present to the
                                Argentine Government certain considerations and questions regarding
                                the basis for a trade agreement between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>Three essential elements comprise the basis for the negotiation of a
                                trade agreement: 1) possible tariff concessions by the United
                                States; 2) the general provisions of the agreement, particularly
                                those relating to quotas and exchange; and 3) possible tariff
                                concessions by Argentina.</p>
                            <p>With reference to possible tariff concessions by the United States,
                                the maximum reduction in United States import charges permitted by
                                the Trade Agreements Act, under authority of which trade agreements
                                are negotiated, is 50 percent. As the Government of Argentina is
                                aware, the United States customarily grants tariff concessions only
                                in respect of articles of which the other country concerned is the
                                chief or an important source of imports into the United States. In
                                accordance with this principle, the Government of the United States
                                has exhaustively studied all products of which Argentina is the
                                chief or an important supplier to the United States. As a result of
                                this study, the Government of the United States is now fully
                                prepared to give consideration to any requests which the Government
                                of Argentina may desire to make in respect of the tariff treatment
                                of the products contained in the attached list.</p>
                            <p>In making the above-mentioned study, the Government of the United
                                States has borne prominently in mind the importance attached <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0243"/>by Argentina to the trade
                                in meat, and has reexamined with the greatest care the questions
                                relating to the importation of chilled and frozen meats from
                                Argentina. It has been forced to conclude that circumstances
                                connected with the sanitary laws and regulations of this country are
                                such that no practicable means can be found for effecting any
                                immediate improvement in this situation. However, the Government of
                                the United States, having in mind possible future developments,
                                would be willing to cooperate with interested governments such as
                                those of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, should such governments
                                desire, in a study of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. A study
                                of these diseases by an international group of well-qualified
                                scientists, preferably non-governmental, might result, among other
                                things, in a finding that meat prepared in certain ways could not
                                possibly transmit these diseases.</p>
                            <p>As regards the second element in the basis for negotiations, namely,
                                the general provisions, the Government of the United States could
                                not consider signing an agreement, involving substantial concessions
                                by the United States which would leave products of the United States
                                exported to Argentina at a disadvantage as compared with like
                                products imported from any other country.</p>
                            <p>The disadvantage to which United States trade in Argentina is now
                                subjected is due to the practice of the Argentine Government of
                                controlling imports on a bilateral basis, by means of prior permits
                                and differential exchange rates, which favors imports from certain
                                countries to the detriment of other countries, particularly the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States fully appreciates that the
                                Argentine Government may be compelled to control imports in order to
                                safeguard foreign debt service and other necessary remittances
                                abroad and to protect the exchange value of the Argentine currency
                                during periods of foreign exchange stringency due to abnormally low
                                returns from exports. However, the Government of the United States
                                believes that any control of imports deemed necessary by the
                                Argentine Government can be exercised more effectively and more
                                fairly on a commodity basis than, as at present, on a country
                                basis.</p>
                            <p>The control of imports on a commodity basis would permit the control
                                of total imports, whereas the present practice may result in a
                                diversion of imports from a disfavored to a favored nation and thus
                                cause only a change in the source of imports. The control of imports
                                on a commodity basis would be more fair than the existing practice
                                because all suppliers to the Argentine market and Argentine
                                importers would receive equitable treatment with respect to such
                                imports as were admitted and the burden of restrictions would be
                                spread over all export and import interests involved in the trade in
                                the articles subject to restrictions. Even in the worst years, many
                                articles could be permitted <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0244"/>to enter without any restriction whatever. In the case of articles
                                subject to restriction Argentine importers would be free to buy
                                where they could buy to best advantage, within the limits determined
                                upon by the Argentine Government.</p>
                            <p>Under the procedure here suggested, import quotas, applicable to
                                imports of particular products from all countries, could be
                                established when necessary for the protection of the exchange value
                                of the Argentine currency. The maximum quantity of a given product
                                which would be admitted into Argentina during a specified period,
                                including any imports of such product under compensation
                                arrangements, would not have to be allocated among supplying
                                countries. However, if the Argentine Government should allocate a
                                share of any such quantity to any third country, the United States
                                would be allotted a fair share on the basis of its position as a
                                supplier in a previous representative period. The previous
                                representative period upon which the share of the United States in a
                                total quota would be based would not necessarily be specified in the
                                agreement. The Argentine Government would be free to select a base
                                period for each product subject to an import quota on the general
                                understanding that the period selected would be representative with
                                respect to imports into Argentina of the product in question. If
                                shares of a quota are allotted to a third country and to the United
                                States on this basis, the balance, if any, of the quota over and
                                above these shares could, if the Argentine Government so desires, be
                                made available to all other countries without specific allocation to
                                such countries, or be allotted among several countries or even
                                entirely to one other country. It is assumed, however, that the
                                Argentine Government would as a general rule wish to allocate the
                                balance, which in some cases would be a large part of the total
                                quota, among other exporting countries on the same basis as that on
                                which the allocation to the United States would be made.</p>
                            <p>Such control of imports, based on careful estimates of exchange
                                available for merchandise transactions after the debt service and
                                other necessary remittances have been provided for and with
                                sufficient flexibility for any revision of such estimates as might
                                appear advisable, would insure that imports would not exceed
                                Argentina’s capacity to pay. Thus the present basis for differential
                                exchange rates as between countries would be removed and since only
                                an amount of imports would be admitted for which exchange was
                                available, payment could be made promptly for all imports.</p>
                            <p>There are attached a set of general provisions which the Government
                                of the United States would wish to have included in a trade
                                agreement, together with a memorandum<note n="12a" xml:id="d270fn12a">Memorandum not printed.</note> explaining the
                                articles pertinent to the above discussion.</p>
                            <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0245"/>
                            <p>With reference to the third element in the basis for negotiations,
                                the Government of the United States would expect the Argentine
                                Government to grant, under a trade agreement, improved customs
                                treatment to important United States products, including: <list>

                     </p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">and to bind existing customs treatment of other
                                products of which the United States is the principal or an important
                                supplier.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Argentina, like the Government of the United
                                States, doubtless has been giving intensive study to the
                                possibilities of a trade agreement and is therefore in a position to
                                indicate at an early date the concessions it would expect the United
                                States to grant in a trade agreement. In the meantime, it is
                                obviously desirable that both Governments make every effort to avoid
                                any publicity in regard to any proposals under discussion or to the
                                fact that such discussions are in progress.</p>

                        <p>115. Department’s telegram 106, June 28, 4 p.m., and instruction No. [6]
                            June 28, 1939. I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs today and
                            left with him the memorandum, at the same time bringing to his attention
                            the points raised in the instruction under reference. Dr. Cantilo
                            assured me that the matter would be given immediate attention, adding
                            that probably even before an official reply is given to our proposals,
                            he hopes to be able to give us a general idea of his Government’s
                            reactions.</p>
                        <p>In order to expedite action I left with the Minister a Spanish
                            translation of the memorandum and its enclosures. Dr. Cantilo expressed
                            appreciation for the thorough study which our Government had made and
                            seemed to understand the need for prompt action.</p>

                                    accepts the present list, in the understanding that maximum
                                    reductions can be obtained on the products mentioned therein; it
                                    reserves for itself the right to propose the amplification
                                    thereof during the negotiations in order to include other
                                    products of interest.”</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>In a conversation which I had yesterday evening with Señor Ceferino
                            Irigoyen, Financial Counselor of the Argentine Embassy in Washington,
                            who is now in Buenos Aires, he volunteered the information that it was
                            his Government’s intention to “stick to the present list” and that the
                            reference to the possibility of proposed amplifications had only been
                            inserted in order to “pacify” the Minister of Agriculture. It would seem
                            that certain officials of the Ministry of Agriculture had desired more
                            time to study our memorandum and insisted upon the insertion of this
                            reservation before they were willing to approve the final text of the
                            Argentine reply.</p>
                        <p>In the light of Señor Irigoyen’s explanation it would therefore appear
                            probable that in the steps leading to negotiations the Argentine
                            Government would not insist upon the inclusion of this reservation.</p>

                     </p>
                            <p>The Argentine Government has studied with the greatest interest the
                                memorandum of the Government of the United States of June 28 last
                                concerning the bases for the conclusion of a commercial treaty
                                between the two countries. The considerations and suggestions of
                                this document are of a constructive character to which the Argentine
                                Government will be disposed to be responsive by making the necessary
                                effort to enable these considerations and suggestions to lead to an
                                early understanding. Thus far, the restrictions that hinder the
                                entry of chilled and frozen meat into the United States, on the one
                                hand, and the existence of a system of exchange control in our
                                country, on the other hand, have constituted a powerful obstacle to
                                negotiations. In the meantime, commercial intercourse has suffered
                                from the inevitable pressure of circumstances. For this reason the
                                Argentine Government attributes special importance to the statements
                                of the memorandum in <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0255"/>which
                                the necessity of controlling exchange in order to protect the value
                                of the currency is recognized. And for its part, prompted by a
                                similar spirit of understanding, it realizes the impossibility of
                                removing at this time the obstacles which prevent the entry of
                                Argentine chilled and frozen meat into that market. It continues to
                                hope, however, that a solution of the problem created by the
                                sanitary regulations may be reached, making possible the
                                encouragement of an increase in the trade of both countries. To this
                                end the Argentine Government is ready to cooperate with other
                                governments interested in the study of hoof-and-mouth disease in
                                general and of the means to avoid it, and it adheres to the proposal
                                of the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The President of the Republic, Dr. Ortiz, explained in his last
                                message that Argentina does not pursue any policy whatsoever of
                                bilateral compensation of trade and expressed his firm conviction
                                that the return to multilateral trade with the minimum of obstacles
                                is what best suits the economic interests of this country. It is to
                                be hoped that such a categorical statement will contribute to
                                dissipate all doubt as to the direction of our commercial policy,
                                taking into account the temporary character of the provisional
                                measures which this country has found it necessary to adopt.</p>
                            <p>The first of the three points of the memorandum refers to the
                                possible tariff concessions by the United States. This is the
                                fundamental key to the entire problem. The physical volume of
                                Argentine exports remains at the same level which existed prior to
                                the world crisis; and owing to the conditions prevailing in the
                                European markets it is only from the United States that it is
                                possible to hope for an increase in purchases which would permit
                                Argentina to increase the imports which it requires in order to
                                continue its economic development intensively.</p>
                            <p>In previous conversations the officials of the United States
                                estimated the possible increase of our exports to that country at
                                approximately 30 to 40 million dollars in the event of certain
                                customs reductions within the limit of 50% of the Trade Agreement
                                Act being granted. Naturally such an increase could only be expected
                                under very favorable economic conditions in the United States.
                                Otherwise the figures would be considerably lower. Therefore it will
                                be necessary to await the concrete results of the agreement before
                                forming a definite opinion on the subject. Meanwhile the essential
                                thing is to come to an understanding which may provide Commerce a
                                firm and stable base for its progressive development.</p>
                            <p>During the conversations carried on in 1938, the Argentine Government
                                proposed a list of products more extensive than that submitted in
                                the last memorandum of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Desirous of hastening the negotiations, the Argentine Government
                                accepts the present list, in the understanding that maximum
                                reductions <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0256"/>can be obtained
                                on the products mentioned therein; it reserves for itself the right
                                to propose the amplification thereof during the negotiations in
                                order to include other products of interest.</p>
                            <p>The second point of the memorandum relates to the exchange control
                                system. In view of the present situation of the balance of payments
                                the Argentine Government is considering the possibility of gradually
                                establishing a system of quantitative control of important groups of
                                imported articles, in order to prevent the reduction of the quantity
                                of an article proceeding from certain regions from being neutralized
                                by the simultaneous increase of imports front other regions. This
                                control would be applied generally and without any difference
                                whatsoever in the rate of exchange with regard to the same
                                    article.<note n="*" xml:id="d272fn1">Even with regard to
                                    articles not subject to quantitative control imports from the
                                    United States would not be subject to a rate of exchange less
                                    favorable than that applied to any other country. [Footnote in
                                    the original.]</note> Therefore, the pertinent suggestions
                                formulated in the memorandum have been favorably received and the
                                Argentine Government takes pleasure in stating its conformity, in
                                principle, with regard to the suggestions in themselves as well as
                                to the principles on which they are based.</p>
                            <p>The concrete application of this method of quantitative control by
                                articles must be thoroughly studied. Feeling certain that the
                                Government of the United States will do everything necessary to
                                increase the importation of products from this country, the
                                Argentine Government is not particularly concerned on the subject of
                                the application of these regulations except with regard to the first
                                period or the period of transition which might cause difficulties of
                                importance. However, it believes that these difficulties may be
                                avoided thanks to the flexibility of judgment with which the
                                pertinent suggestions are set forth in the memorandum. In effect,
                                the agreement does not establish bases to determine the
                                participation of each country in the importation of articles subject
                                to quantitative control; the possibility is also admitted that the
                                percentile participation may increase or decrease by reason of
                                special factors. This will surely make it possible to find a
                                satisfactory solution in certain cases which might otherwise cause
                                considerable disturbance at first: a reasonable initial percentage
                                might later be increased as the result of an increase in the
                                quantity of exchange available whether through an increase of
                                exports or through an influx of foreign capital.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, the third point of the memorandum concerns customs reductions
                                to be granted for articles proceeding chiefly from the United
                                States. The Argentine Government considers this point very favorably
                                insofar as prevailing conditions may permit. In this respect the
                                following must be borne in mind: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) customs
                                duties on articles in the list submitted in the memorandum are
                                essentially for revenue and not for protection. The reductions must
                                be such that they will not affect <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0257"/>materially the revenue at times when it might be
                                necessary to increase other taxes in order to balance the budget;
                                    (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) customs duties do not weigh on the
                                American exporter but on the Argentine consumer; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the substantial reduction of duties on
                                certain articles would only injure revenue without increasing
                                appreciably the volume of sales of American exporters; sales will
                                increase in proportion with the buying power of the Argentine people
                                through the increase of exports; this, and not the price, is the
                                determining factor in the problem.</p>
                            <p>With a view to hastening the study of this point the Argentine
                                Government wishes to know what reductions the Government of the
                                United States is interested in obtaining.</p>
                            <p>The desire expressed in the memorandum to have a prompt reply has
                                made it possible to consider only those fundamental subjects set
                                forth in order that the discussions may proceed. There are other
                                points of minor importance which will have to be studied immediately
                                and on which it will not be difficult to obtain a concurrence of
                                opinion.</p>

                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador<note n="15" xml:id="d273fn15">Felipe A.
                                Espil.</note> called to inquire as to the progress we were making in
                            regard to our reply to the Argentine note on the proposed trade
                            agreement. I told the Ambassador that we were hard at work on it with a
                            view to getting a reply to them as soon as possible. He asked me my
                            personal opinion as to whether the Argentine position as outlined in its
                            recent note is such as to constitute a basis for a trade agreement. I
                            told him that with regard to the most important point, namely the
                            abandonment of the bilateral system and the use of exchange control to
                            effectuate this system, the situation seemed to me satisfactory. I
                            mentioned, however, one or two points in the Argentine note which had
                            caused me a little concern. First was the statement that the Argentine
                            Government accepts the present list of products on which concessions
                            might be granted by the United States on the understanding that maximum
                            reductions can be obtained on these products. I said that we can not, of
                            course, agree, even tacitly, in advance of negotiations and public
                            hearings on the concessions to be granted; that while we are reasonably
                            satisfied that concessions could be granted which would make the
                            agreement worth while to Argentina, we can not determine until we get
                            into actual negotiations what concessions can be granted. The second
                            point that <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0258"/>caused me some doubt
                            was the implication in the Argentine note that in allocating any quotas
                            that might be established for the protection of the Argentine currency
                            the share allotted to the United States would be variable. I said that
                            this seemed to reflect some misunderstanding of our position; that while
                            our proposal did contemplate some flexibility in the percentual share
                            allotted to the United States, any such variation would in my opinion be
                            justified only in very exceptional cases. The Ambassador said he felt
                            sure that neither of these points would create any difficulty at
                            all.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador himself raised a further point which needs a little
                            clarification. He said that he had noted the Argentine reservation of
                            the right to propose, during the negotiations, additional products on
                            which concessions might be requested of the United States. The
                            Ambassador said he fully understood our procedure on this point and that
                            it would not be possible without additional notice and hearings to
                            consider any products not on the original published list.</p>
                        <p rend="right">August 17, 1939.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador phoned me this morning and said that after his
                            conversation with me he had talked to Irigoyen,<note n="16" xml:id="d273fn16">C. Alonso Irigoyen, Financial Counselor of the
                                Argentine Embassy.</note> who is now in Buenos Aires, over long
                            distance telephone on another matter and had taken the occasion to
                            mention the personal doubts which I had expressed on the points
                            mentioned above. Irigoyen said that we need have no apprehension
                            whatever on the points referred to; that the Argentine Government in
                            drafting its note to us was fully aware of the fact that no decision as
                            regards the concessions to be made by the United States could be reached
                            until after our hearings and that announcement of negotiations on the
                            basis of the Argentine note would put us under no obligations whatever,
                            tacit or otherwise. With respect to the second point Irigoyen said that
                            apparently the Argentine note had given an impression contrary to what
                            was in the minds of the Argentine officials; that he clearly understood
                            that variations in the percentual share would be definitely
                            exceptional.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had also referred, in his telephone conversation
                            with Irigoyen, to the Argentine reservation regarding the addition of
                            products for consideration during the negotiations and pointed out to
                            him that under our procedure this would involve an additional notice and
                            hearings and would not, therefore, be practicable. The Ambassador said
                            that Irigoyen said that he was aware of our procedure on this point, as
                            were his colleagues in Buenos Aires; that the reservation was put in
                            only to satisfy the Minister of Agriculture and that we would not need
                            to worry about their taking any advantage of it.</p>

                        <p>12. The extended discussions with the Argentine officials have finally
                            brought us to a position where the way is clear to open negotiations
                            with every prospect of a good agreement being reached, A trade agreement
                            would as you know buttress and solidify the good-neighbor policy as well
                            as bring about a distinct improvement for our trade and a positive
                            advance against totalitarian methods. Failure to seize this opportunity
                            would have the reverse effect by turning the present cordiality into an
                            equal measure of ill-feeling and result in retrogression in our
                            commercial relations with Argentina.</p>
                        <p>The proposal is to announce trade-agreement negotiations immediately with
                            a view to completing them before late autumn. Wallace has agreed to
                            this. All are agreed that we can work out an agreement which can be so
                            safeguarded as to avoid injury to American production. Secretary Hull
                            feels, however, that political hazards in such negotiations are such
                            that he does not in these circumstances wish to take responsibility of
                            urging you; that the decision must rest with you. On the other hand, I
                            personally feel, and Grady<note n="17" xml:id="d274fn17">Henry F. Grady,
                                Assistant Secretary of State.</note> concurs, that this agreement
                            might well be made a political asset in view of popular approval of
                            closer relations with Latin America and the obvious contribution which
                            it would make to this end. Please let me know by telegraph whether you
                            approve going ahead. In case you instruct us to proceed will you
                            telegraph Wallace and ask him to cooperate wholeheartedly in defending
                            the agreement and to take suitable steps to see that his organization
                            does so, since the Secretary feels strongly that this must have the
                            whole-hearted and active support of yourself and Wallace.</p>

                                        to this matter might be taken to imply that the percentual
                                        share of the United States in a given quota might be
                                        determined or changed without reference to a representative
                                        base period, whereas the proposal of the Government of the
                                        United States contemplates that the regulation of imports
                                        would be effected ordinarily, in the case of any product,
                                        through a change in the total permitted imports from all
                                        sources, the percentual share of the United States normally
                                        remaining unchanged. The proposal of the Government of the
                                        United States also contemplates, however, the possibility of
                                        change in a base period, which might result in a change in
                                        the percentual share of the United States in the total
                                        permitted imports of a particular product, if the trend of
                                        the trade or other factors should indicate that the base
                                        period originally chosen is no longer truly representative.
                                        With reference to the concessions to be included in the
                                        proposed agreement, it is understood of course that specific
                                        concessions, including the amount of reduction in duties,
                                        cannot be determined in advance of negotiations and prior to
                                        public notice and hearings in the United States. The
                                        Government of the United States considers that on this
                                        understanding the interchange of views between the two
                                        Governments affords sufficient prospect that if negotiations
                                        were undertaken they could be brought to a mutually
                                        satisfactory conclusion. Accordingly, the Government of the
                                        United States is prepared to issue public notice of
                                        intention to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with the
                                        Government of Argentina.</item>
                                    <item>3. If agreeable to the Government of Argentina, the public
                                        notice will, subject to confirmation, be issued on August
                                        23. The time allowed for written briefs will be 4 weeks, and
                                        public hearings will begin on October 9. Shortly thereafter,
                                        definitive negotiations in regard to specific tariff
                                        concessions can begin. Meanwhile, work on the general
                                        provisions of the agreement could proceed.</item>
                                    <item>4. The Government of the United States would be gratified
                                        if the negotiations could take place in Washington and if an
                                        Argentine delegation could arrive about the first of
                                        October.”</item>

                  </p>
                        <p>If the Argentine officials should request an explanation of the first two
                            sentences of point 2 above, you should make use of the pertinent parts
                            of this Government’s memorandum of June 28, 1939.</p>
                        <p>Request no publicity pending public notice. In view of the time urgency,
                            it would be helpful if discussions of the general provisions could start
                            immediately. These could be carried on with the Argentine Embassy here.
                            It is desirable to avoid the arrival of a trade delegation before the
                            close of the period allowed for written briefs, probably September 23.
                            You might say that this would not apply of course to the early return of
                            Irigoyen, who could assist in the general provisions discussions.</p>

                        <p>132. Department’s telegram no. 131, August 19, 10 p.m. With reference to
                            paragraph numbered 3, you should immediately inform the Argentine
                            officials that public notice of intention to negotiate will be released
                            here, if agreeable to the Argentine Government, for publication in the
                            morning newspapers of August 23. At the same time, you should inform the
                            Argentine officials that, on further consideration, it is planned to
                            allow 6 weeks, or until October 4, for written briefs. The hearings will
                            begin on October 16. Consequently, it would be desirable for the
                            Argentine trade delegation not to arrive before the end of September.
                            These changes in dates should not involve any delay in concluding the
                            agreement, since, meanwhile, negotiations in regard to the general

                            two Governments and a statement, along the general lines of that issued
                            in connection with Canadian notice, which will include the following:

                                <p>“Imports into Argentina from certain countries, with which
                                    Argentina normally has an export balance of trade, have in

                                    has agreed that the proposed trade agreement will be based upon
                                    the principles of multilateral trade which underlie the

                            the memorandum which the Minister for Foreign Affairs delivered to me at
                            8:00 o’clock tonight.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. The Argentine Government has received with satisfaction
                                    the memorandum of the Government of the United States in which
                                    the latter says it is disposed to announce publicly its
                                    intention to negotiate a reciprocal commercial agreement between
                                    both countries and hastens to express its agreement in order
                                    that the said announcement may be made simultaneously by both
                                    Governments on the date indicated.</p>
                           <p>2. The Argentine Government also shares the sentiments
                                        expressed by the Government of the United States that an
                                        understanding has been arrived at on the general bases for
                                        the negotiations and it is convinced that the differences of
                                        interpretation in the application of the quantitative
                                        regulations by products to which reference is made in the
                                        second paragraph of the memorandum may be duly clarified
                                        during the negotiations.</p>
                                    <p>The Argentine Government considers that upon applying the
                                        quantitative regulation of imports for the greater efficacy
                                        of the system of exchange control—applying the same with a
                                        general character to all countries—it has satisfied fully
                                        also the principle formulated by the Government of the
                                        United States, contrary to the system of bilateral
                                        regulation of trade, and has thus removed the fundamental
                                        obstacle which had hindered previous negotiations.</p>
                                    <p>The Argentine Government also considers that the choice of
                                        certain representative periods for the application of
                                        quantitative regulations is generally acceptable. But it
                                        will be necessary to proceed with flexible criteria with
                                        respect to certain special cases in order to avoid serious
                                        disturbances in the development of our trade with other
                                        countries.</p>
                                    <p>However, even in those exceptional cases the Argentine
                                        Government in order to avoid any action which might be
                                        interpreted as discriminatory is disposed to apply the
                                        regulations in such a way as to prevent diversion of imports
                                        from neutralizing the restrictions applied; also the same
                                        rate of exchange would apply to imports of a given article
                                        of any country. The inherent flexibility of the system as
                                        well as the mutual spirit of cooperation which animates both
                                        Governments, will make it possible to find equitable
                                        formulae as circumstances may require.</p>
                                <p>3. The Argentine Government also agrees in general with the
                                    program of work outlined in the memorandum and it shares the
                                    desire of the Government of the United States that the general
                                    provisions of the agreement may begin to be examined forthwith.
                                    The Argentine Government would prefer for the time being that

                        <p>134. To avoid loss of time, you should begin at once discussions in
                            regard to the general provisions of the proposed agreement, on the basis
                            of the draft enclosed with instruction no. 6 of June 28.</p>
                        <p>Comments on the general provisions and certain recent improvements in
                            language will be sent shortly by air mail. These should be helpful in
                            your discussions. Meanwhile, proceed as far as you can with the aid of
                            such telegraphic instructions as you may feel called upon to seek in
                            regard to difficult points encountered in the discussions. A tentative
                            list of concessions to be requested of Argentina is being prepared and a
                            copy thereof, with supporting data, will be sent to you as soon as
                            possible. Meanwhile you can assemble and bring up to date the relevant
                            material available to the Embassy, with a view to offering helpful
                            comments on the tentative list when it is received and before it is
                            transmitted to the Argentine authorities. You should suggest to the
                            Argentine authorities that they bring up to date their studies of
                            articles of which the United States is the first or an important
                            supplier, in order to avoid delay in their consideration of our
                            tentative requests.</p>
                        <p>This procedure, which has been discussed with Ambassador Espil, should be
                            agreeable to the Argentine authorities in view of paragraph <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0264"/>3 of the Foreign Office note of August

                            embodying the principal points and have now received a reply of which

                                    this purpose there has been made publicly known a list of
                                    articles for which there is considered the possibility of
                                    granting concession of customs character, in order that the
                                    persons or entities directly interested may set forth their
                                    points of view concerning the advisability of including such
                                    articles or not in the negotiations, and make any suggestion
                                    with regard to the manner, the extent and the nature thereof.
                                    For briefs to be presented it has been established that these
                                    must be submitted before midday of October 4 next. The date on

                                    been fixed, but, in order not to delay the negotiation, all the
                                    necessary measures will be taken so that such hearings may
                                    terminate, at the latest, simultaneously with those to be held
                                    in the United States.</p>

                            <item>The Department had no advance notice that the Argentine Government
                                intended to publish a list of products on which it will consider
                                granting tariff concessions to the United States. Furthermore, apart
                                from unofficial reports in the press, we have no knowledge of what
                                the list referred to in the Foreign Office communication of August
                                29 contains. It is obvious that the Argentine authorities should
                                have given this Government an opportunity to go over any such list
                                in advance of publication, just as we gave them an opportunity to go
                                over the list of products on which this Government will consider
                                granting concessions to Argentina, which list was published here on

                                that memorandum clearly stated that duty reductions would be
                                requested on additional products and that the binding of existing
                                customs treatment would be requested on other products of which the
                                United States is the principal or an important supplier to

                        You should discuss this matter immediately with the Argentine
                                    authorities in the sense of the above, and say that, in view of
                                    their decision to publish a list of products, your Government
                                    has instructed you to request them to publish a comprehensive
                                    list, to be described as a list of products on which the
                                    Government of Argentina will consider granting concessions to
                                    the United States, such list to include the following products
                                    which, for reasons of economy, are identified in this telegram
                                    by their new tariff numerals and brief descriptions only. The
                                    list as published should contain full descriptions as they
                                    appear in the new Argentine tariff except in those cases,
                                    indicated below by asterisks in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, in which
                                    only part of the coverage of the tariff number or numbers or new
                                    or additional language as given needs to be specified. The
                                    grouping of the items is for the purpose of informing you and
                                    the Argentine authorities confidentially <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0266"/>as to the general nature of the
                                    tentative requests which will be sent by air mail tomorrow. The
                                    list as published should be described as indicated above and the
                                    products should be listed in order of their tariff numbers with
                                    no indication whatever as to the nature of this Government’s
                                    tentative requests in regard to any item or group of items.</item></list>

                                to negotiate, we have agreed at the request of the Argentine

                                in Buenos Aires. We understand from your despatch under reference

                                Washington for the final stages of the negotiations. We understand

                                immediately after arrival here. Presumably the necessary studies,
                                including study of information and views submitted by interested
                                Argentines to their Government, will be expedited as much as

                        <p>152. Your despatch no. 104 of September 5, 1939.<note n="28" xml:id="d283fn28">Not printed.</note> It is strongly desired that
                            the issuance of a supplemental public announcement here be avoided since
                            any delay caused thereby in the completion of public hearings and the
                            consideration of views presented at such hearings would greatly enhance
                            the difficulty of concluding the agreement within the necessary time
                            limit. You should therefore endeavor to discourage any requests by the
                            Argentine Government for concessions on products not included in the
                            list published with the public announcement of August 23. In this
                            connection the rule of principal or important supplier generally
                            followed by this Government in granting concessions in trade agreements
                            should be borne in mind and, if advisable, again called to the attention
                            of the Argentine officials. In the light of our studies, it is difficult
                            to see what additional products of any real importance in Argentina’s
                            trade with the United States and of which Argentina is the principal or
                            an important supplier to the United States, the Argentine officials
                            could have in mind.</p>
                        <p>It should be pointed out that this Government would have to consider any
                            additional requests for concessions in the light of the above-mentioned
                            supplier rule and that in any event it could not consider granting a
                            concession to Argentina on any product not published with the public
                            announcement of August 23 unless a supplemental public <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0268"/>announcement were made and opportunity
                            given to all interested persons to present their views regarding such
                            product.</p>
                        <p>The impracticability of issuing a supplemental announcement was discussed
                            in a conversation with Ambassador Espil on August 16, a memorandum of
                            which was sent you with the Department’s instruction no. 55 of August

                        <p>174. Reference article number 16 of the proposed general provisions of
                            the trade agreement with Argentina. The Argentine subcommittee requests
                            the addition of an exception reading in translation as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The favors which the Argentine Republic may have granted or may
                                    in the future grant to adjacent countries.”</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>The Argentine officials explained that the addition of this exception was
                            intended to balance our requirement for exceptions in the case of Cuba
                            and the Panama Canal Zone. Although special relationship of the United
                            States to Cuba and the status of the Canal Zone were fully explained, it
                            was contended that if Argentina should sign a trade agreement
                            recognizing our right to grant preferential treatment to third country
                            without obtaining a similar concession in exchange, a dangerous
                            precedent would be established. In addition it was said that Argentina
                            wished to have it recognized that it had special relations with adjacent
                            countries. It was added that Finland, in exchange for Argentine
                            recognition of Finland’s right to grant preferential treatment to
                            Estonia, agreed not to claim any concession Argentina might grant to any
                            Latin American country. However, Argentina signed a trade agreement with
                            Denmark last April recognizing without compensation Denmark’s special

                        <p>175. Department’s telegram No. 152, September 12, 7 p.m. Last night the
                            Argentine Government presented the subcommittee with a note dated
                            September 18 and addressed to me requesting amplification of the list of
                            articles concerning which the United States will consider granting
                            tariff concessions. Recalling that in its memorandum of August 12<note n="30" xml:id="d285fn30">

                            translation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The events of the last few days make the extension of the tariff
                                    concessions to be accorded by the United States to Argentina,
                                    especially desirable. A considerable increase in our purchases
                                    of United States products being evident, we must concern
                                    ourselves with bettering the outlook of our exports to the

                                <p>It is for this reason that the list includes some import
                                    classifications in which Argentina has not had a predominant
                                    share, but which, by their nature can be easily produced and
                                    manufactured in this country.”</p>

                        <p>The additional list together with the corresponding 1930 United States
                            tariff numbers is as follows: 41 casein glue, 42 refined glycerine, 207
                            fluorspar, 703 hams and shoulders, 709 butter, 712 chickens and ducks,
                            713 eggs, egg yolk and egg albumen, 725 macaroni, noodles, et cetera,
                            730 oil cake, 738 apple cider, 745 peaches, green, ripe or in brine, 748
                            prunes, plums, green, ripe or in brine, 772 canned, prepared or
                            preserved tomatoes, 765 to 775 fresh and dried vegetables (seasonal
                            periods only), 775 hash of vegetables and/or fish, 806 concentrated

                            goat, Cashmere goat and Alpaca hair, 1530 goat and sheepskins rough
                            tanned, 1558 grape oil (desired that it be despatched under this

                        <p>Of the 37 items (34 tariff numbers) listed, 10 fall within the tariff
                            classifications of articles included in the list submitted to the
                            Argentine Government and later published but represent additions of
                            specific products. Fourteen items cover new classifications not
                            previously mentioned, but which are already subject either to binding or
                            to special duties under one or more effective reciprocal trade
                            agreements. Ten items refer to new classifications not now subject to
                            any reciprocal trade agreement and three items are not classified
                            according to tariff number.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0270"/>
                        <p>Of the last 13 items, not more than 7 were imported by the United States
                            in substantial quantities during the years 1935 to 1937 inclusive. Of
                            the 7, imports from Argentina were of consequence in only 2 cases.
                            Moreover, it does not appear that this country would be able to displace
                            any present principal supplier by reason of conditions resulting from
                            the war in Europe. Of the entire list only butter seems to meet the
                            requirements generally accepted as essential in our trade agreements
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>We have made every effort to dissuade the Argentine Government from
                            making this request and its attention has been repeatedly invited to
                            both the time element and assurances by Espil that additional Argentine
                            products for consideration would not be requested. However, the
                            Argentine officials appear to be definitely perplexed as to the possible
                            effects of the war<note n="32" xml:id="d285fn32">Tor correspondence
                                concerning the European war, see <ref target="frus1939v01">Vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>

                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>I assume that in the absence of a new public announcement additional
                            products could not be considered in the negotiations simply because they
                            fall within the tariff classifications of other products mentioned in
                            the list as already published. With respect to the articles covered in
                            other trade agreements, some statement might be effective here
                            indicating the probable duration of those agreements, namely, those with
                            the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Cuba and Belgium.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate telegraph instructions regarding: (1) whether the
                            Department is disposed to accept the additions requested by the
                            Argentine Government; (2) if so what effect acceptance will have on the
                            ultimate date for public hearings in the United States; and (3) whether
                            acceptance will affect the date on which the American delegation will

                                products, on which this Government will consider granting
                                concessions to Argentina, which was published with the public

                                <p>In regard to the above products, you should explain that
                                    Argentina has supplied no fluorspar, apple cider or rough tanned
                                    goat and sheep skins to the United States recently; that total
                                    imports into the United States of dead ducks are negligible;
                                    that after careful study of all vegetables included in paragraph
                                    765 to 775, it was found prior to publication of the list on
                                    August 23 that consideration could be given in the case of
                                    Argentina only to asparagus; and that Argentina has been a minor
                                    supplier to the United States of the remaining products. You
                                    should emphasize, however, that the concessions indicated are
                                    now applicable through generalization to any imports into the
                                    United States from Argentina of the foregoing products. You may
                                    state that this Government does not anticipate the termination
                                    of any of the agreements containing these concessions.
                                    Concessions granted to Cuba are not generalized to any other
                                    country.</p>
                                <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0272"/>
                                <p>Although a concession has been granted in the Canadian agreement
                                    on 703, bacon, hams, and shoulders, etc., the benefits of this
                                    concession have not accrued to imports of hams and shoulders
                                    into the United States from Argentina because the existing
                                    sanitary regulations affecting such imports require removal of
                                    bones. However, these regulations are now under
                                    consideration.</p>
                        <p>3. You should inform the Argentine officials in strict confidence
                                    that it is contemplated that a public announcement of intention
                                    to negotiate a trade agreement with Chile will be made here

                        </p>
                                <p>You should state that any concessions, probably on a seasonal
                                    basis, granted to Chile on the fruits and vegetables listed
                                    above, as well as on crude tartaric acid, would be extended to
                                    Argentina.</p>
                     <p>4. In regard to the products not dealt with in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3
                                above, you should explain to the Argentine officials that total
                                imports into the United States of casein glue, concentrated grape
                                juice, vinic alcohol, grapeseed oil, penguin skins and cracklings
                                are of negligible commercial importance. During recent years
                                Argentina has supplied no imports of egg yolks and egg albumen;
                                tomatoes, canned, prepared or preserved; or hash of vegetables
                                and/or fish. Argentina is a very minor supplier of butter (the
                                principal suppliers being the Netherlands and New Zealand with
                                Argentina supplying about 1 percent of total imports); macaroni,
                                noodles, etc.; oil cake and oil cake meal; and weasel skins.
                                Argentina has supplied less than 10 percent of imports of wools
                                finer than 44’s (paragraph 1102(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)) and
                                angora goat, cashmere goat and alpaca hair. Water hog skins and
                                cattle, ox and calf tail hair, total imports of which are very
                                small, have continuously been on the free list and are unlikely to
                                be removed therefrom.</p>
                            <p>5. On the basis of the foregoing information you should make every
                                endeavor to persuade the Argentine officials to withdraw their
                                request that this Government consider granting concessions on any
                                products not included in the list of products published with the
                                public announcement of August 23. The addition of any product, no
                                matter how unimportant, to that list would require public
                                announcement, a <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0273"/>new period
                                for written briefs and oral hearings. It is practically certain that
                                this would delay the negotiations so as to make it impossible to
                                conclude the agreement within the limits of the time
                                available.</p>

                        <p>179. Referring to the trade agreement in yesterday’s meeting the
                            following objections and suggestions were informally made by the
                            Argentine subcommittee.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The proposed articles governing exchange and quantitative control
                                are not sufficiently flexible to allow satisfactory solution of
                                problems growing out of war such as European blocking of exchange
                                for Argentine exports. They suggested negotiation of ancillary
                                documents to take care of special arrangements during war.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>They also suggested that the agreement provides for a permanent
                                mixed commission to which all special problems would be referred.
                                The committee would also be employed on occasions contemplated in
                                final paragraphs of articles 7 and 13.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>They thought that the clause of article 8 reading “Unless it is
                                mutually agreed to dispense with such allotment” may provide the
                                flexibility they desire provided it applies to all questions of
                                quantitative control.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Argentina objects to article 9 on the grounds that it would limit
                                it in government purchases to a greater extent than contemplated by
                                Argentine law. The subcommittee was reminded that without such
                                provision the practical effects of most favored Nation treatment
                                would be substantially annulled.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Their objections to article 10 were: prohibition of restrictions
                                or delay on transfers as provided in clause (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and the exchange rate provisions of clause (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>). As indicated in its notes of August 12
                                and 22, the Argentine Government has taken the position that
                                equality of exchange treatment should be on a commodity basis and
                                this would mean that the wording “any article” to conform to their
                                understanding should read “Any like article”. The Argentine
                                Government understands article 10 as now worded to mean that only
                                one rate of exchange could be employed for all imports thus forcing
                                them to abandon their present policy of employing different exchange
                                rates to assist necessary imports and restrict those not considered
                                as essential.</item>

                        <p>170. Your no. 179, September 23, 3 p.m. Your paragraph (1). You should
                            reiterate, on the basis of the pertinent parts of the memorandum
                            enclosed with instruction no. 6 of June 28, that the Articles on
                            quantitative restrictions and exchange control, taken together, leave a
                            large degree of flexibility by permitting the regulation of imports,
                            through quotas, in conformity with exchange availabilities. If, as we
                            hope and expect, the Argentine Government will be successful in avoiding
                            commitments or arrangements which would have the effect of earmarking
                            for purchases in third countries exchange arising out of Argentine
                            exports to such countries, and retains its freedom to restrict when
                            necessary the imports of particular products by means of quotas, the
                            Articles as drafted would appear to provide ample flexibility even under
                            war conditions in Europe. In this connection you are authorized to say
                            to the inter-ministerial committee that if the Argentine authorities run
                            into such difficulties in current negotiations with the British
                            Government or any other government, and desire our assistance in
                            avoiding hampering commitments or stipulations, we would, upon request,
                            do all in our power to aid them.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, we perceive the possibility that the
                            British may seek to block exchange arising out of Argentine exports to
                            the United Kingdom. At the first convenient opportunity therefore you
                            should, unless you perceive objection, broach this subject orally with
                            high Argentine officials and impress upon them the great disadvantage
                            from Argentina’s own standpoint as well as ours of any such blockage of
                            exchange which would, among other things, seriously prejudice the
                            trade-agreement negotiations between our two countries. You should state
                            that if blockage of exchange is threatened in the case of the United
                            Kingdom or any other important country, the Government of the United
                            States would upon request take our interest in the matter up with the
                            foreign government or governments concerned.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph (3). This Government does not contemplate that the quoted
                            clause could be used as a means of weakening or waiving the
                            effectiveness of Article 8. We might, in the light of all pertinent
                            facts, agree to a global quota which could not be allocated among
                            countries of origin, or even in some special cases agree to dispense
                            with allocation to the United States of a share of a particular quota
                            which has been partially allocated to a third country or countries. <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0275"/>However, we obviously could not
                            be expected to do so if the allotment to third countries but not to the
                            United States would deprive this country of an opportunity to obtain a
                            fair share of the total quota. The flexibility provided by the quoted
                            clause is not, therefore, very great.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph (5). Prompt payment for permitted imports should be
                            possible under the provisions of the quota and exchange Articles by
                            keeping imports within the capacity to make payments through the
                            imposition of whatever quotas may be necessary. Furthermore, since
                            regulation of imports would be exercised through the imposition or
                            non-imposition of quotas on individual products and through the amount
                            of the quotas established, there would appear to be no necessity for
                            differential exchange rates between products for the purpose stated. The
                            basic purpose and intent of the articles as drafted is to substitute
                            quotas for exchange rates as a means of trade control.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph (4). You should request copies of the pertinent Argentine
                            laws dealing with government purchases of foreign articles and transmit
                            a set to the Department. It does not seem reasonable that the Argentine
                            Government wishes to retain freedom to discriminate against the United
                            States in regard to such purchases or that Argentine law should so
                            provide.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph (2). A permanent mixed commission for the purpose
                            mentioned would not be practicable from our viewpoint. In fact this
                            Government could not agree to the establishment of any such commission
                            the existence of which might be construed as a delegation of the powers
                            conferred on the President by the Trade Agreements Act or whose
                            functions might conflict with those of existing American Government
                            agencies. The purpose in mind would be served best, in our opinion, by
                            intergovernmental communications through the usual channels. Each
                            government may find it desirable, of course, to maintain or establish
                            one or more interdepartmental committees to study the operation of the
                            agreement, with particular reference to matters calling for consultation
                            between the two governments.</p>

                            165 of September 23, 4 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m. in regard to the
                            desire of the Argentine Government to have certain articles added to the

                            concessions in the proposed trade agreement, I have the honor to enclose
                            a copy of a note,<note n="34" xml:id="d289fn34">Not printed. The note
                                gave to the Argentine Government the information with respect to
                                specific items contained in telegram No. 165, September 23, 3 p.m.,
                                    <ref target="#pg_262">p. 262</ref>.</note> which, in accordance
                            with the Department’s instruction aforementioned, I addressed to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs on September 26th last.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the progress of the trade-agreement negotiations here,
                            the Embassy and the Consulate General feel with increasing apprehension
                            that there are certain basic principles of the general provisions on
                            which there is not yet agreement and on which, indeed, we may encounter
                            some difficulty. Apart from the position of the Government here that
                            contiguous countries of Argentina be excepted in the application of the
                            most-favored-nation principle, there is some reason to suppose that
                            Argentina is not really contemplating any very radical departure from
                            its bilateral trade policy, at least as long as the European war
                            continues. Another matter of concern is the apparent intention of the
                            Argentine Government, as expressed by members of its negotiating
                            sub-committee, to press for a transitional period to precede the
                            granting to the United States of unconditional most-favored-nation
                            treatment. As evidence of these positions, I enclose a copy of a
                                memorandum<note n="35" xml:id="d289fn35">Not printed.</note> of a
                            conversation yesterday with Dr. Alberto Bonf ante, Assistant Chief of
                            the Division of Economic and Consular Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs. I am also enclosing a copy of a memorandum<note n="35" xml:id="d289fn1">Not printed.</note> of comments on the matter
                            prepared by the Consul General and dated yesterday.</p>
                        <p>The members of our sub-committee, as well as myself, are using every
                            opportunity to impress upon the Argentine Government the imperative need
                            to define clearly and promptly its position on these various matters and
                            the need to come to an agreement on at least the fundamentals before our
                            delegation departs from the United States. I stressed these points in
                            conversations with the Foreign Minister on September 25th and with the
                            Under Secretary yesterday afternoon. Dr. Torriani, Director of the
                            Division of Economic and Consular Affairs, has arranged for Consul
                            Ravndal and Mr. Randall, Assistant Commercial Attaché, to have a
                            conversation this afternoon with Sr. Irigoyen, Financial Counselor of
                            the Argentine Embassy in Washington, now in Buenos Aires, and Messrs.
                            Ravndal and Randall intend to take this opportunity to ascertain more
                            definitely just what the Government here now has in mind with respect to
                            several of these basic principles of the trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, the Department may wish to withhold making public
                            the exact time when it is contemplated to have the delegation <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0277"/>sail for Argentina. We would
                            obviously be placed at a disadvantage were the delegation to sail before
                            we have come to a clear agreement on the points to which I have
                            referred.</p>

                        <p>171. Your 174, September 20, 6 p.m. The suggested additional clause would
                            seriously undermine the most-favored-nation principle as applied to
                            trade between the American Republics. It is to the long-run interest of
                            Argentina as well as to the United States to strengthen rather than
                            weaken this principle not only in this hemisphere but throughout the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Approaching the subject from this broad viewpoint, you should reiterate
                            as coming from the Department (1) that in the case of the Panama Canal
                            Zone our exception has no commercial significance and that despite the
                            relationship of the zone to the United States such negligible imports as
                            there are from that source are charged with the duties which apply to
                            like products imported from foreign countries; (2) that our exception in
                            the case of Cuba, based on exceptionally close historic ties dating from
                            Cuban independence, aside from being of small practical importance to
                            Argentina, has become generally recognized as a standard exception in
                            United States commercial treaties and agreements entered into since
                            1902; (3) that the “adjacent countries” exception has not been generally
                            recognized as a defensible exception for the very good reason that it
                            would if generally adopted destroy much of the value of the
                            most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>In amplification of the last point, you might point out the serious
                            consequences for Argentina if the United States should allow imports of
                            a wide range of agricultural and other products from the adjacent
                            countries of Mexico and Canada free of duty or at low rates while
                            similar Argentine products were subject to high rates of duty. Such a
                            situation would have arisen if the reciprocal arrangement which was
                            negotiated with Canada in 1910–11, giving Canadian wheat, corn, canned
                            and preserved meats, tallow, and many other products preferential
                            treatment as compared with our imports of such products from Argentina
                            had become effective.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you should continue to exert every effort, in view of such
                            considerations, to persuade the Argentine authorities to withdraw their
                            suggestion.</p>

                        <p>187. Your despatch no. 163 of September 29, 1939. You suggest, in the
                            final paragraph of your despatch under reference, that if the other
                            experts to assist you in the negotiations were to sail before agreement
                            is reached on the fundamentals of the general provisions it would place
                            you at some disadvantage. In as much as the plan is for these experts to
                            sail October 20, the matter requires immediate consideration. The
                            Department does not consider it advisable to postpone their sailing for
                            the following reasons.</p>
                        <p>In view of the large amount of detailed work involved in connection with
                            negotiating the schedules, any material delay in the beginning of this
                            work would greatly enhance the difficulty of completing the negotiations
                            by January 1.</p>
                        <p>A further reason for having the group sail as planned is the belief that
                            the agreement of the Argentine officials to the general provisions as
                            desired by this Government might be facilitated if the main outstanding
                            issues were dealt with conclusively after the schedules have been
                            discussed and those authorities are able to visualize the trade
                            agreement as a whole. During the discussions which have taken place here
                            with the Argentine Ambassador intermittently over a period of several
                            years, he constantly argued that matters relating to the treatment of
                            American trade in respect of Argentina’s exchange control system could
                            not be dealt with until Argentina was in a position to know what tariff
                            concessions would be offered by the United States. In the light of this
                            experience it is even conceivable that the Argentines may now be
                            deliberately withholding acceptance of our position on certain major
                            points until they see what tariff concessions we will offer. In these
                            circumstances, it seems advisable to continue discussions, maintaining
                            our position on all the important points in the general provisions and
                            emphasizing in every way the importance we attach to them but avoiding
                            if possible bringing these questions to a definite and final conclusion
                            until after the schedules have been fully discussed.</p>
                        <p>A further reason for deferring conclusive action on the general
                            provisions prior to discussing the schedules is that with a little more
                            time the effect of the European war on the Argentine position may tend
                            to clarify itself.</p>
                        <p>The Department realizes, of course, that the sailing of the group of
                            experts from here, in the face of Argentina’s non-acceptance of certain
                            fundamental points in the general provisions, may imply to the Argentine
                            authorities that less importance is attached to those points than you
                            have represented. Possibly this implication could in part at least <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0279"/>be avoided if you were to say
                            that while a satisfactory adjustment of the points now at issue is vital
                            to the conclusion of an agreement, it seems, nevertheless, incumbent
                            upon the two Governments to go on with detailed discussions covering the
                            entire scope of the agreement with a view at least to completing the
                            task of ascertaining definitely and in detail wherein divergences
                            exist.</p>
                        <p>The Department had hoped, in view of the discussions preceding
                            announcement of negotiations, that the general provisions could readily
                            be disposed of before the beginning of definitive discussions on the
                            schedules. In view of the situation which now appears to be developing
                            the best course seems to be to abandon this plan and proceed as outlined
                            above. However, the Department would be glad to have any comments and
                            suggestions that may occur to you.</p>

                        <p>238. Argentine counter-proposals on Schedule II indicate acceptance of
                            offers on the following items: 42; 232 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>); 409;
                            701; oleo oil and stearin; 705; 712; dead birds not specially provided

                            Rate on 712, turkeys, is accepted but removal of quota limitation is
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>Further concessions embodying a full 50% reduction in duty are requested
                            on the following items: 19; 38; 701, tallow 706, both classes, with the
                            removal of the minimum ad valorem provisions; 710 to include romano or
                            pecorino, reggianito or parmesano, reggianito, provolone and provoletto,
                            sbrinz, cheddar and goya, with a minimum ad valorem of 20%; 742, grapes,
                            with effective period beginning February 15; 762 with no quota
                            limitation; 1101, wools not under bond, the full reduction on each of
                            the four types; 1530 and 1558.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the counter-proposals contain requests for the maximum

                            proposals but which appeared in the published list of August 23; 713;
                            724, with a customs quota of 250,000 tons annually and binding of the
                            present rate on all imports over that amount; 730; 749; 779; 1102<hi rend="italic">a</hi>; 1681, fox and lambskin furs.</p>
                        <p>Several items which were not on the published list were also included in

                            matters probably not falling within the province of trade agreement
                            negotiations, including a request for a definition of cured meat which
                            would include meats heated to 147 degrees for 10 minutes which were <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0280"/>entered for use at the New York

                        <p>The utmost importance is apparently attached to a satisfactory concession

                            <item>In view of the wide disparity in the positions of the two
                                Governments on important phases of the proposed trade agreement and
                                the extremely limited time available for completing these
                                negotiations, it seems desirable that the situation be discussed
                                with complete frankness with the appropriate Argentine authorities
                                in an endeavor to reach an understanding which will facilitate rapid
                                progress.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>From the procedural standpoint, the central fact of which the
                                Argentine negotiators might be reminded is that this Government has
                                presented complete proposals covering all aspects of the agreement
                                and may properly expect that in completion of the first phase of the
                                negotiations, Argentina as its contribution to rapid progress will
                                furnish us at the earliest possible date a complete reply indicating
                                its position on all of these proposals. In this connection, you
                                might say that this Government has conscientiously sought at all
                                times to base its proposals upon the realities of the situation
                                confronting both governments and that it has carefully avoided
                                taking a bargaining position in formulating its proposals. It is
                                earnestly hoped that the Argentine negotiators will approach these
                                problems in the same spirit. It is important that they be made to
                                realize that any effort to maintain what appears to us to be an
                                extreme bargaining position can only result in unnecessary delay
                                which will militate seriously against bringing these negotiations to
                                a successful conclusion.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>In line with our general approach to the negotiations as indicated
                                above, our Schedule II proposals were formulated with extreme care
                                on the basis of all available information and were made as liberal
                                as the pertinent facts and considerations permit. These offers are
                                contingent of course upon acceptance of our proposals regarding the
                                general provisions and Schedule I. In order that there may be a
                                clear understanding of the situation, we believe that you should
                                inform the Argentine officials definitely at this point that no
                                substantial improvement <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0281"/>in
                                our offers will be possible. We would be willing to reexamine our
                                offers, on the basis of specified and reasonable Argentine requests,
                                with a view to seeing whether any minor improvements might be made.
                                However, even on the basis of requests of that nature, it would be
                                futile and unproductive to ask the trade-agreements organization to
                                undertake a reexamination of Schedule II until we have a complete
                                and satisfactory reply from the Argentine Government on our general
                                provisions and Schedule I proposals. For your information, we fear
                                that as long as the Argentine negotiators think that there is a
                                chance of substantial improvement in our Schedule II offers, they
                                will withhold their Schedule I proposals and will continue their
                                refusal to give us proposals on the general provisions which offer a
                                real basis for negotiation.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Any discussion which you may now have with a view to clarifying
                                the situation should, of course, include frank comment on the
                                attitude of the Argentine negotiators with respect to the general
                                provisions. We entered into these negotiations on the understanding
                                that the agreement would assure us complete nondiscriminatory
                                treatment in the Argentine market. You should make it clear,
                                furthermore, that regardless of any question as to whether the
                                Argentine Government qualified its acceptance of the basis with
                                reference to particular aspects of the general provisions, we cannot
                                conclude an agreement with Argentina which does not assure us of
                                nondiscriminatory treatment. The proposals thus far made by the
                                Argentine negotiators would not give us such assurances; in fact,
                                they do not even appear to offer an improvement over our present
                                situation. For example, their proposals on exchange apparently are
                                intended to assure us nondiscriminatory treatment with regard to
                                exchange rates, but contain no assurances regarding the availability
                                of exchange for permitted imports. With respect to quotas, their
                                proposals envisage substantial discrimination against us over an
                                indefinite, but presumably extended, future period. In “special
                                cases”, which would apparently include many of our most important
                                products, this discrimination would be even more severe under the
                                agreement than at any time in the past. In other words, they
                                apparently contemplate merely substituting one form of
                                discrimination for another.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Argentine proposals also fail to provide reasonable protection for
                            their duty concessions in Schedule I. Without technically violating the
                            agreement, these concessions might be impaired or nullified through use
                            of selective exchange rates, or through the imposition of highly
                            restrictive quotas. Furthermore, while refusing to obligate themselves
                            to give us notice and an opportunity for consultation regarding quotas
                            on Schedule I products, the Argentine negotiators inform us that the
                            imposition of a quota on any Schedule II product would be regarded as
                            cause for the immediate termination of the <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0282"/>agreement. We have, of course, recognized the need of
                            accommodating the agreement to Argentina’s possible needs and to
                            reconcile ourselves to some impairment of concessions in Schedule I, but
                            obviously we cannot acquiesce in a denial of our reasonable request for
                            assurances that we will be notified and have a chance to make our views
                            known before the concessions we have paid for are taken away. It should
                            be clear to the Argentine negotiators that acceptance of such proposals
                            by us, especially under the difficult circumstances in which we find
                            ourselves, would be a manifest impossibility.</p>

                        <p>245. The contents of the Department’s telegram No. 231, November 29, 6
                            p.m. was embodied in a formal note addressed to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs which, in the Minister’s absence due to illness, I handed to the
                            Under Secretary this evening. In the ensuing conversation I stressed the
                            points made in the Department’s telegram and suggested that the Foreign
                            Minister might wish to discuss the situation with his Cabinet colleagues
                            with a view to reaching an understanding which would facilitate rapid
                            progress towards the satisfactory conclusion of the agreement before the
                            Christmas holidays. The Under Secretary said he would personally take my
                            note to the Minister immediately and convey the suggestion offered.</p>
                        <p>I hope to discuss the situation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            himself on Monday by which time he would be prepared to give us the
                            assurances we desire.</p>

                        <p>250. Embassy telegram 245, December 1, 8 p.m. In a formal reply dated
                            December 2 to the Embassy’s note of December 1 the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs advises that the Argentine Government intends to make every
                            effort to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement with the United States
                            prior to the Christmas holidays. He insists that there has not been any
                            unnecessary delay on the part of the Argentine negotiators who have been
                            required to examine carefully various commitments proposed by the United
                            States which have not heretofore <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0283"/>been included in any of Argentina’s trade agreements. He remarks with
                            reference to Argentina’s counter-proposals on Schedule II that since we
                            habitually derive greater advantages than Argentina from our common
                            trade we should be disposed to grant greater concessions than we expect
                            to receive in exchange.</p>

                        <p>262. Personal for the Ambassador from the Secretary. I am cabling you
                            today the best offers we can make on flaxseed and canned beef. I have
                            given the questions presented most careful personal attention and I want
                            you to have the background of the situation as it now exists here in
                            order to assist you in interpreting convincingly our position to the
                            Argentine authorities. I want you to know that I have carefully
                            considered the views you have expressed in recent oral and telegraphic
                            communications, and that the only reason we cannot go as far as you
                            suggest is the really emergency character of the situation which
                            confronts us here.</p>
                        <p>In regard to flaxseed, I fully understand the Argentine interest in
                            improving the concession on this product and the matter has been gone
                            into carefully with Secretary Wallace with a view to making as much of
                            an improvement in our offer as circumstances will permit. I am fully
                            satisfied, however, that to go further than we have indicated in today’s
                                telegram<note n="36" xml:id="d296fn36">Not printed.</note> would
                            endanger everything we are trying to do. It is as much in Argentina’s
                            interest as our own that our concession on this product, which is now as
                            good as we can safely offer, be kept within safe and defensible
                            limits.</p>
                        <p>With reference to canned beef our telegram of today maintains our
                            original offer without a customs quota. I had in mind prior to the
                            recent discussions with you a reduction in the duty to 3 cents and 20
                            percent and a customs [quota?] of one percent of Federally inspected
                            domestic production of fresh meats. On this basis, the average global
                            customs quota over the 10-year period 1929 to 1938, inclusive, would
                            have figured out at about 129 million pounds in contrast with imports in
                            the peak year of that period of 88 million pounds and a low of 19½
                            million pounds. With production of fresh meats at 12 billion 404 million
                            pounds in 1938, the quota for 1939 would have been 124 million pounds.
                            Since the quota would not be an absolute quota, but merely a customs
                            quota, it would not only permit imports to come in at the reduced duty
                            to an amount nearly 50 percent greater than those <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0284"/>in the peak year, but would permit an
                            expansion even beyond this level since there have been large imports
                            even at the present rate. On the basis of the Argentine negotiators’ own
                            appraisal of the situation, as we understand it, of the prospects for
                            developing their exports to this market, the concession in the form just
                            outlined would be entirely adequate. A quota of the size indicated in
                            conjunction with the improvement in the duty, would I believe, represent
                            an actual improvement over our present offer. In view of this and since
                            I am satisfied it would help us materially in defending the agreement
                            here, this solution seems to me to be the best one from the standpoint
                            of both countries. If you can get this quota proposal before the proper
                            authorities without insisting on it or impairing your negotiating
                            position, it is just possible that such a proposal would be voluntarily
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know that I fully appreciate the difficulties of your
                            situation in these important negotiations, and I am entirely confident
                            that if they can be brought to a successful conclusion, you will find
                            the way to do it. It may help you on a suitable occasion to explain to
                            the proper Argentine authorities the situation in which we find
                            ourselves here and its relation to these negotiations. You might remind
                            them that the Trade Agreements Act comes up for renewal in Congress at
                            its next session; that in my opinion the opposition which is developing
                            against the continuation of this program and of these agreements is
                            assuming serious proportions; that our ability to carry forward our
                            whole program of improving international commercial relations is,
                            therefore, at stake; and that any agreement with Argentina which goes
                            beyond the limits of safety—and we believe we have reached those
                            limits—can only defeat itself.</p>

                        <p>301. Confirming my conversation over the telephone with Hawkins<note n="37" xml:id="d297fn37">Harry G. Hawkins, Chief, Division of Trade
                                Agreements.</note> yesterday afternoon, our full proposals based on
                            telegraphic instructions from the Department were handed to Cantilo
                            shortly before 8 o’clock Monday evening under cover of (1) a formal note
                            enclosing the schedules, the general provisions and proposed exchange of
                            notes regarding subsidies, etc. and (2) a personal note, based on the
                            Secretary’s personal telegram to me, explaining the situation and
                            inviting understanding and sympathetic consideration of our
                            proposals.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0285"/>
                        <p>The Minister read the personal note in my presence and his attitude was
                            not discouraging. The following noon, however, presumably after he had
                            talked with the experts, he appeared very much discouraged and told me
                            that he saw no basis for a trade agreement in our proposals. He stated
                            that he had already instructed Torriani to give him a detailed statement
                            at the earliest practicable date. I gained the impression that he felt
                            the principal trouble lay in Schedule II.</p>
                        <p>Just after my conversation with Hawkins, Ravndal called on Torriani with
                            a view to obtaining a more precise indication of the reaction to our
                            proposals. Torriani and Bonfante who was with him gave the impression of
                            being extremely discouraged. Torriani like Cantilo said that he saw no
                            basis whatsoever for a trade agreement in our proposals. With reference
                            to the customs quota on flaxseed, he asserted that, with the increase in
                            flaxseed production in the United States, Argentina probably would be
                            unable to export much if any in excess of the customs quota with a rate
                            as high as 75 cents a bushel. He said that our offers on canned beef
                            were unsatisfactory and that the alternative proposal, involving a
                            global customs quota, did not represent any worth while improvement
                            because Argentina’s share in our canned beef imports averaged less than
                            50% which meant that Argentina could not look forward to a duty
                            reduction on more than 65,000,000 pounds per annum, an amount which
                            would not permit of any appreciable expansion of Argentina’s total
                            exports to the United States. He added that the situation possibly would
                            have been somewhat less hopeless if the United States had offered to
                            remove the customs quota on dead turkeys, to give a reasonable customs
                            quota on corn, a reduction on hides, and improved treatment on fresh
                            fruits other than grapes. As for the general provisions he reiterated
                            that he personally saw no way of accepting them on the basis of our
                            Schedule II proposals, and the Government of the United States
                            apparently would not change its general provisions requirements,
                            particularly with respect to articles III, IV, and XI. He stated with
                            reference to clause A of article IV that Argentina will not assume
                            exchange under obligations which it might not be able to fulfill. He
                            concluded by expressly stating that he was merely giving his personal
                            views, the inter-Ministerial committee having concluded its appraisal.
                            Asked when there would be a subcommittee meeting to discuss the
                            proposals, he said they would reply to our proposals in writing and that
                            he perceived no occasion for a meeting in the interim.</p>
                        <p>Following this conversation we prepared a brief memorandum, indicating
                            the 1938 trade coverage of our proposed schedules and the increase in
                            Argentina’s exports to the United States in the first 11 months of 1939
                            and suggested that under the proposed trade agreement <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0286"/>Argentina’s exports to the United
                            States in 1940 and subsequent years would be far greater than they will
                            be if no agreement is signed.</p>

                        <p>309. Embassy’s telegram 301, December 20, 3 p.m. Confirming our
                            conversation with Hawkins, the Argentine Government’s formal reply to
                            our revised proposals was handed to me at 11 o’clock this morning.</p>
                        <p>They express the hope that the circumstances which unfortunately prevail
                            at this time will not be allowed to prevent us from satisfying
                            Argentina’s minimum requests and reiterate that their firm intention to
                            contract only those obligations which they can meet requires them to
                            maintain the position adopted in matters of exchange and quantitative
                            regulation of imports.</p>
                        <p>They imply that they were led into public announcement under a
                            misconception of the situation, saying that they could not interpret our
                            reply of August 20 to their memorandum of August 12 as presaging the
                            small importance of our proposed tariff concessions and the institution
                            of a system of customs quotas, which they assert was not even hinted at
                            during the preliminary conversations held in Washington and Buenos
                            Aires.</p>
                        <p>They recall that they were persuaded to withdraw their requests for the
                            addition of articles to the list of products which would be considered
                            for tariff treatment and that there then remained to them only the
                            possibility that the maximum reductions at the time would be the
                            difficulties for the items included in the original list. However, they
                            go on to say that the Government of the United States, in its proposals
                            of November 15, omitted certain products like corn, pears and cheese,
                            which offered possibilities for increasing the exchange available for
                            payment of imports, offered no reduction on hides and restricted the
                            value of the concessions on flaxseed and frozen turkeys by means of
                            customs quotas. They point out that while a 50% reduction in the
                            specific duty on canned beef was offered, the ad valorem rate was
                            increased, which would mean that if a growth in demand should cause the
                            price of the product to rise this would immediately initiate a
                            nullification of the advantage obtained and automatically check any
                            possibility of their exports reaching the important proportions
                            contemplated under the general frame work of the agreement. As for the
                            alternative proposal, it is stated that if it is borne in mind that
                            Argentina’s share of our imports of canned beef amounts to only 45% of
                            the total, the scant value of the offer will be readily appreciated. In
                            the best of cases, they say, there could only be a probable increase of
                            10,000 <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0287"/>tons over their present
                            exports, which is very far from their long range expectations in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>They explain that the reason they first presented their counterproposals
                            on Schedule II, requesting more generous treatment, was their belief
                            that a large increase in the sale of Argentine products to the United
                            States is a condition <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> to the
                            contraction of obligations in matters of exchange and quantitative
                            regulation of imports.</p>
                        <p>They assert that our revised proposals are not only very far from the
                            minimum which they consider essential, but also would create a serious
                            problem for the future of our reciprocal agreement. In this connection
                            they stress the difference they perceive between a system of quotas
                            imposed for the purpose of keeping imports down to the amount the
                            country can pay for and a system of quotas which serves protectionist
                            purposes only.</p>
                        <p>They say that the imposition of customs quotas on products which, like
                            flaxseed and canned beef, have constituted the fundamental items in
                            Argentina’s exports to the United States would create a situation too
                            serious to be accepted, and they remark in this respect, “We could not
                            possibly conceal the surprise that this proposal caused us.” They recall
                            that the conviction existed here that the chief purpose of negotiating
                            an agreement was to increase the volume of reciprocal trade, but claim
                            that under our proposals the reality would be entirely different.</p>
                        <p>They say that they are aware of the factors tending to make the United
                            States self-sufficient and therefore can estimate what the acceptance of
                            a customs quota would mean. They feel that under normal conditions the
                            customs quota would in effect signify the maximum limit of their share
                            in supplying the American market during the life of the agreement, and
                            in this connection they point out that the same reasons which are now
                            responsible for the suggested imposition of a customs quota might lead
                            to progressively smaller customs quotas.</p>
                        <p>They point out with respect to coarse wools that they have not been able
                            to obtain any satisfaction in the matter of an increased tolerance. As
                            for the duty reductions on wools not finer than 44s, they say these are
                            of no interest since they amount to only 5 cents pet category, or a
                            reduction of only 17 per cent. They add in this regard that they desire
                            for this type of wools, as well as for those under paragraph 1101 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), the maximum reductions which can be granted
                            under the Trade Agreements Act.</p>
                        <p>They note that we recently offered a reduction of only 25 per cent on
                            hides, but recall that we have offered nothing on corn.</p>
                        <p>They concede their references to Schedule II by asserting that their
                            analysis of the situation entirely justifies the requests they have made
                            during the course of the negotiations and they express the hope that <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0288"/>the spirit of understanding
                            which animates the authorities of the United States will facilitate the
                            acceptance of the Argentine Government’s point of view and permit tariff
                            reductions on Argentina’s major export products to be granted without
                            any limitations whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>They go on to refer to their requests for modification of our
                            administrative regulations affecting imports of their products and note
                            that they have not as yet received a satisfactory report. In this
                            respect they urge that any customs concession no matter how great can be
                            annulled through the application of administrative regulations and
                            insist that the latter must be modified if the agreement is to produce a
                            substantial increase in their exports.</p>
                        <p>With regard to quantitative regulation of imports, they state they have
                            accepted most of our proposals but consider it essential to maintain a
                            certain degree of flexibility of action, so that under exceptional
                            circumstances the system would not be too rigid to permit the
                            fulfillment of obligations contracted with the United States and other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>They assert categorically that the position of the Argentine Government
                            with respect to matters of exchange and quantitative regulation of
                            imports is definitive and cannot be modified. In this connection, they
                            say it is the firm purpose of the Argentine Government to give the most
                            favorable treatment possible to imports of United States origin. They
                            regard it of capital importance that the Argentine Government maintains
                            exchange control and quantitative regulation of imports for the sole
                            purpose of protecting the value of the currency and of continuing to
                            meet its international financial obligations. It is with these aims that
                            the Argentine Government seeks to obtain an increase in the volume of
                            Argentina’s exports to the United States. As a result of the agreement,
                            they go on to say, that if the Government of the United States takes
                            into account all the factors which have led Argentina to consider its
                            position on matters of exchange and duty reductions for Argentine
                            products as final, the Argentine Government, desirous of harmonizing the
                            interests of the two countries in other matters in which there is still
                            disagreement, would be disposed to reexamine its proposals even though
                            it considers that in the matter of customs it has practically reached
                            the maximum of concessions it can grant.</p>
                        <p>It is stated that the Argentine Government entered the negotiations
                            feeling fully confident that the results thereof would permit it
                            gradually to return to multilateralism in international trade; that one
                            of the great difficulties encountered heretofore has been the United
                            States tariff coupled with administrative measures that constitute
                            additional restrictions on Argentina’s export trade. The note ends with
                            the statement that the Argentine Government hopes that the full
                            application of the general principles represented by the Government <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0289"/>of the United States in matters
                            of economic policy will make it possible to conclude a trade agreement
                            of mutual benefit.</p>

                        <p>310. Embassy’s telegram No. 309, December 23, 3 p.m. As the Argentine
                            reply reported in the Embassy’s telegram under reference indicates, the
                            present impasse concerns mainly our Schedule II offers. If we could
                            offer them a Schedule II which they would accept it is believed that
                            they might agree to a Schedule I and general provisions which although
                            not all we want would be acceptable to us.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the general provisions, we believe that they Would agree
                            first to accept article III on the understanding that any special cases,
                            which we would not accept in principle, would come within the provisions
                            of new article XII; second, to give us a commitment in article IV to
                            make exchange available for all permitted imports from the United States
                            and to make such exchange available as promptly for such imports as for
                            imports from any third country; and third, that in practice, under the
                            provisions in article XI similar to those included in the Swiss or
                            Netherlands Agreement, they would give us an opportunity for
                            consultation before imposing quotas on Schedule I products.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Schedule II we are inclined to believe, although we cannot
                            know definitely, that they would agree to sign the agreement if we
                            offered them unlimited entry on flaxseed at 45 cents and accepted
                            general provisions as indicated above. We are doubtful whether they
                            would with a customs quota on flaxseed even if it were raised to
                            15,000,000 bushels at 40 cents however they might reluctantly accept
                            this if we offered them other improvements in Schedule II, with
                            reference to the products mentioned in the Embassy’s telegram under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>It has occurred to us that there may be an alternative way in which to
                            deal with the present crisis in the negotiations and the difficult
                            situation at home, namely, to make use of the escape clause in article
                            XII rather than customs quotas in quieting the apprehension of those who
                            fear that imports of a particular product may increase to such an extent
                            or at such prices as to seriously affect domestic producers. Pointing to
                            this clause as a means of taking care of any eventuality might be even
                            more effective than pointing to the specified limits of customs quotas
                            since the latter seem to imply that nothing will be done until imports
                            pass those limits, which are certain to be regarded as high by domestic
                            producers.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0290"/>
                        <p>In order to make it clear that article XII is intended to cover the
                            possible effects of concessions, the words “threatens serious injury to
                            producers or the commerce” would be substituted for “of prejudicing the
                            industries or commerce”. Furthermore, article XI could be made more
                            flexible, so as to permit quotas on schedule products at any time deemed
                            necessary, subject to the right of the other country to terminate the
                            agreement, as in article VI of our trade agreement with Venezuela,
                            without the last sentence thereof.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances we believe that it would be greatly preferable to
                            have an agreement with more than ordinary flexibility than to have the
                            negotiations fail as they may if we continue to insist upon customs
                            quotas. We therefore hope that consideration will be given to the
                            possibility of adopting the alternative course suggested above, although
                            the Argentines probably would not be altogether pleased with it we
                            believe that they would sign an agreement on such a flexible basis and
                            that it should be possible to defend such an agreement.</p>

                            follows, the opening paragraph and the antepenultimate paragraph, quoted

                                <p>[“] The Argentine Government has analyzed with all good faith the
                                    new proposals which have been made, and its analysis discloses
                                    that they do not represent a substantial improvement with
                                    respect to the previous position.</p>
                                <p>In effect, for two products of primary interest, linseed and
                                    canned meats, the principle of the customs quota is
                                    retained.</p>
                                <p>This is the fundamental difficulty in accepting the schedule of
                                    reductions which Your Excellency’s Government proposes. It is
                                    necessary to intercede once more that the Argentine Government
                                    hopes that this agreement may constitute an instrument capable
                                    of permitting a definite equilibrium in the interchange between
                                    the two countries, which is indispensable in order to assure for
                                    merchandise originating in the United States the system for the
                                    granting of prior exchange permits which is being requested.</p>
                                <p>If in the agreement we do not obtain for two products of such
                                    importance customs reductions which can be utilized freely and
                                    without limitation of quantity, its practical application will
                                    give a stable character to the deficit which normally
                                    characterizes our commercial interchange with the United States.
                                    Such a situation, capable of remedy if there should be
                                    maintained the conditions which governed in international
                                    commerce up to the year 1930, constitutes in the present
                                    circumstances a serious problem which can only be resolved in
                                    the agreement if the concessions stipulated for Argentine
                                    products permit a calculation to be made, with a reasonable
                                    security, that there will be produced a considerable increase in
                                    the volume and value of our sales to the United States.</p>
                                <p>With respect to that which is set forth in Your Excellency’s note
                                    relative to the detriment of a customs quota, I must point out
                                    to the Ambassador that in the judgment of the Argentine
                                    Government, when in order to increase a market it is necessary
                                    to enter into competition with local production which is highly
                                    protected, it is completely untenable, practically and
                                    theoretically, that a tariff reduction linked to a quota, favors
                                    the development of the trade. In these cases it follows that it
                                    is [more?] important to obtain the application of duty reduction
                                    to the total volume which it may be possible to place in the
                                    United States market than to reach the maximum reduction
                                    permitted by the Trade Agreements Act.</p>
                                <p>Even though in the note of the 22nd instant and in previous
                                    [conversations?] we have explained fully our points of view
                                    regarding the concessions which we consider essential to obtain
                                    from the United States in order to arrive at the signature of
                                    the agreement, we regard it necessary to set forth here several
                                    arguments which may facilitate their rapid comprehension.</p>
                                <p>We will recall with respect to linseed, that since the average of
                                    our exports is very much larger than 12 million bushels, the
                                    reduction offered us does not favor in any sense a real increase
                                    in allowance the volume of our sales, nor does it contribute, in
                                    an effective way to the <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0294"/>discouragement of a domestic production obtained, thanks to a
                                    high tariff and to ostensibly governmental measures of an
                                    internal character.</p>
                                <p>Evidently, the customs quota alone tends to furnish a check on
                                    the increase of our exports and it is necessary to point out
                                    here that the Argentine Republic is the primary producer of
                                    linseed and the most important supplier of the world market, and
                                    that in treating of an article in which case we have
                                    indisputable lead, it was natural to hope that there would be
                                    displayed on the part of the Government of the United States an
                                    attitude in harmony with the basic principles that inspire its
                                    commercial policy tending to reestablish international
                                    commerce.</p>
                                <p>In order to produce an increase in our exports of linseed to the
                                    United States, it would be necessary that through a lower cost
                                    obtained by a reduction in the duty, the domestic price in the
                                    United States would be reduced so as to encourage an increase in
                                    the consumption of this oil seed, in order for it to be able to
                                    displace substitutes, or to increase the use of linseed oil in
                                    conjunction with other oils. But it is well known that the price
                                    of a product is always fixed by the cost of the marginal
                                    supplies, which is [<hi rend="italic">in?</hi>] the case of
                                    Argentine linseed, would be represented by the importations over
                                    and above the quota. Therefore, the practical application of
                                    this system does not signify the least improvement with respect
                                    to the actual situation. If we carried the argument to the
                                    extreme, it would be possible to say that the quota rates would
                                    have the same effect as a reduction in duty in favor of American
                                    importers, which would not benefit the Argentine producer.</p>
                                <p>With regard to meats, the expansion obtained through a specific
                                    customs reduction subject [to?] a quota, is considered entirely
                                    insufficient in the face of the obligations which the Argentine
                                    Government would assume as a consequence of the proposed
                                    agreement. We desire to obtain for meats the maximum reduction
                                    permitted by law without limitation of quantity. The reduction
                                    should be extended not only to the specific duty but also to the
                                    ad valorem duty. At the present time when preserved meat has an
                                    f.o.b. Buenos Aires value higher than 15 cents United States per
                                    pound, the ad valorem duty would already be effective on
                                    Argentine meats which obtain a higher price because of their
                                    quality. On the other hand, preserved meats from competing
                                    countries would be the chief beneficiaries of a reduction which
                                    would only partially affect our products and which would be
                                    obtained by the Argentine Government as a counterpart of
                                    important concessions. In this regard it suffices to recall the
                                    statement made by the Argentine subcommittee in its memorandum
                                    of September 20 last.</p>
                                <p>With regard to corn, for which no concession is offered, we
                                    should recall that in the memorandum referred to above there was
                                    also stressed the considerable importance to our country of the
                                    possibility of marketing in zones near certain ports of the
                                    United States, an annual volume of 250,000 tons, and it was
                                    stated that this request could not be considered separately but
                                    should be taken into account bearing in mind the aggregate of
                                    obligations derived from the agreement.</p>

                                <p>We limit these considerations to the examination of the new
                                    proposal of the United States, because we feel that with respect
                                    to all the other points of difference there could only be
                                    repeated the arguments already known and which in the opinion of
                                    this Government are sufficiently convincing.</p>
                                <p>In comparing the concessions which both countries have offered in
                                    customs matters to date, Your Excellency states that
                                    ‘altogether, the reductions and bindings thus far offered would
                                    cover only about 60% of Argentina’s imports from the United
                                    States, on the basis of 1938 figures, as compared with
                                    concessions in Schedule I covering about 86% of imports into the
                                    United States from Argentina.’ But the percentages mentioned by
                                    Your Excellency in this case are in the present abstract indices
                                    and lead to error. The reality is as follows: The Argentine
                                    Republic has offered reductions and bindings for a total of
                                    goods which upon entering the Republic have a value of
                                    181,000,000 pesos and the United States offering reductions and
                                    bindings for Argentine goods which upon being exported from our
                                    country reach a value of only 102,000,000 pesos Argentine
                                    currency. These figures correspond to the real value of the
                                    merchandise calculated with regard to imports and exports at the
                                    official buying rate of exchange which governed in 1938.</p>
                                <p>But, in comparing Schedules I and II annexed to the agreement, it
                                    should also be borne in mind that the granting of reductions has
                                    been planned taking as a basis two entirely different tariff
                                    systems. In the United States the customs tariff constitutes a
                                    real barrier raised for protectionist purposes, with high
                                    customs duties which are reinforced by the application of
                                    administrative measures.</p>
                                <p>Our customs tariff has always had an exclusively fiscal purpose
                                    and, with it, has not been intended to eliminate foreign
                                    products from the domestic market. For numerous articles for
                                    which duties are now being bound, the values fixed by law are
                                    far below the real value of the goods, and the duties levied on
                                    the importation thereof are low. Furthermore, it should be
                                    recalled that even though the customs tariff establishes duties
                                    and values in pesos gold, they are paid for in pesos of the
                                    national currency at the rate of 2.27 and that, notwithstanding
                                    the change in value of our currency, the valuations which serve
                                    as a basis for the application of the duties have not been
                                    revised. The Argentine Government, in accepting bindings has
                                    waived the possibility of modifying the tariff valuations to
                                    adapt them to the present actual situation. On the other hand
                                    the reductions accorded are of importance and they represent a
                                    real sacrifice which deprives the state of an important part of
                                    its revenue. These considerations lead to the hope that the
                                    Government of the United States will appreciate the real
                                    significance of not only the value of the concessions already
                                    offered by this Government in matters of customs reductions but
                                    also the disequilibrium which exists between the advantages
                                    offered by Argentina and the proposals made the United
                                    States.</p>
                                <p>It is also fundamental that Your Excellency’s Government
                                    reconsider its requests in matters of exchange and quantitative
                                    regulations <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0296"/>on imports.
                                    In the manner in which the pertinent clauses of the agreement
                                    have been proposed they constitute a rigid system which could
                                    not be applied in practice.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand the position adopted by the Argentine Republic
                                    in this matter is not doctrinaire and only conforms to the
                                    reality of international commerce. It assures to the products of
                                    the United States a treatment no less favorable than that
                                    accorded to the products coming from any other country and a
                                    preponderant share in the supplying of the Argentine market,
                                    with the only reservation of conserving a certain elasticity
                                    which would be applied when the circumstances so required for a
                                    limited number of exceptional cases.</p>
                                <p>Your Excellency may be certain that the minute study of the
                                    system such as we propose, and our insistence in not modifying
                                    it, explain the impossibility of accepting other bases. On the
                                    other hand, the firm intention and the known interest of the
                                    Argentine Government to accord to imports from the United States
                                    the most favorable treatment possible constitutes a guarantee of
                                    fair treatment, more smoothness, than all the stipulations which
                                    might be imagined</p>
                                <p>In leaving clearly established the position of the Argentine
                                    Government, I cherish the hope that Your Excellency’s Government
                                    will be disposed to reconsider its offers with a view to
                                    satisfying the legitimate and reasonable aspirations of both
                                    Governments in order thus to reach the signature of an agreement
                                    which represents a real step in the improvement of the trade
                                    between our two countries.</p>
                                <p>I take the opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency the
                                    expressions of my highest and most distinguished
                                    consideration.</p>

                        <p>291. Your telegram 317, December 30, 6 p.m. The Argentine position
                            regarding the proposed trade agreement has been carefully and
                            sympathetically considered.</p>
                        <p>The position in which the negotiations now stand seems to be as follows:
                            The Argentine Government considers our offers in Schedule II inadequate
                            in relation to Argentine needs. We have again carefully canvassed the
                            situation with a view to seeing whether some improvement could be
                            offered. No further improvements in the Schedule will be possible. We
                            are sure that if the Argentine authorities will reexamine our offers
                            they will find that an agreement on this basis would provide real
                            protection and an opportunity for expansion of Argentine exports to this
                            country. The Argentine Government doubtless will carefully weigh the
                            position of Argentine exports to this country if an agreement along the
                            lines of our present offers were concluded, against what their position
                            would be in the unfortunate event that no agreement should be
                            consummated. In the absence of an agreement <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0297"/>domestic production is likely to continue to build up
                            under the protection of the present rates and Argentina’s ability to
                            share this market with our own producers will be greatly reduced.
                            Moreover, there can be no assurance, in the absence of a trade
                            agreement, that protectionist forces in this country will not succeed in
                            bringing about the imposition of new restrictions.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the general provisions and in particular to the
                            exchange and quota articles, note is taken of the statements in the
                            Argentine Note under reference that these provisions are unduly rigid
                            and unresponsive to the realities of the position in which Argentina
                            finds itself. In this connection it should be pointed out that the
                            provisions which we have indicated a willingness to accept fall very
                            materially short of those which we would like and which we had expected
                            to get at the time these negotiations were announced. Having in mind the
                            problems confronting Argentina we have reluctantly departed from our
                            initial position in certain important respects in order to meet the
                            Argentine Government’s desire for greater elasticity. We refer to our
                            recession in the exchange article from the provision requiring prompt
                            provision of exchange to one permitting delays in the provision of
                            exchange on a most-favored-nation like article basis. (Our telegram 286,
                            December 26, 8 p.m.) and to our recession from the requirement of a
                            single rate of exchange for all products to one for most-favored-nation
                            treatment on a like article basis (Our telegram 231 [<hi rend="italic">251</hi>] December 13, 5 p.m.<note n="42" xml:id="d303fn42">Not
                                printed.</note>). We do not consider therefore that we have shown a
                            disposition to be unduly rigid.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless in an earnest effort to meet the Argentine viewpoint to the
                            fullest possible extent, we are prepared to include as a second
                            paragraph to Article IV, as amended by our 286, December 26, a provision
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“2. If, as a temporary and emergency measure, the government of
                                    either country finds it necessary to deviate from the provisions
                                    of this article, it shall, not less than 14 days prior to the
                                    date on which it proposes to take any action having such an
                                    effect, notify the government of the other country of its
                                    intention to take such action and afford the government of the
                                    other country full opportunity for consultation with respect
                                    thereto. If no agreement with respect to the proposed action is
                                    reached within the aforesaid period of 14 days, the government
                                    of either country shall be free thereafter to terminate this
                                    agreement in whole or in part on 30 days’ written notice.”</p>

                        <p>This proposal is contingent upon agreement by the Argentine Government to

                            inclusion in the final minutes of an undertaking by the Argentine
                            Government to reconsider the base period in any case in which we make
                            representations that the base period is manifestly unrepresentative. It
                            should be understood that if no agreement were reached we would be free
                            to terminate the agreement under Article XII. (See point 3 in the
                            Department’s telegram No. 251 of December 13, 5 p.m.). Under this
                            proposal, together with our other proposals, we see no necessity for any
                            “special cases.” However, if the facts warranted, the Argentines could
                            approach us under Article XII and terminate the agreement if we refused
                            to consent.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Schedule I, you should ascertain and cable the best
                            Argentine offers at the earliest possible moment, bearing in mind that
                            we consider our amended request on lumber of vital importance.</p>
                        <p>Since our proposals as outlined above represent a last effort to bring
                            these negotiations to a successful conclusion and the occasion is
                            therefore one of unusual importance, we consider it advisable and
                            appropriate for you to ask the foreign minister to go with you to the
                            President in order that you may lay our position before both of them. In
                            this way it is believed the appearance of going over Cantilo’s head
                            could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>You should request a prompt decision by the Argentine Government in the
                            premises as it is indispensable that an agreement be signed or public
                            announcement of the termination of the negotiations be issued at the
                            earliest possible moment. If the Argentine reply should be unfavorable
                            you should proceed immediately to discuss the issuance of an explanatory
                            public statement along the lines indicated to you on the telephone
                            Saturday.</p>

                        <p>3. Department’s telegram 291, December 31, 10 p.m. I handed a formal note
                            based upon the Department’s telegram under reference <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0299"/>together with a memorandum commenting
                            on the Argentine note of December 30 to the Foreign Minister this
                            evening. The real value of our offers, their finality, and the time
                            element were stressed. A copy of the draft joint statement in the event
                            of failure the negotiations was also handed to Cantilo.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister’s attitude was not encouraging but he stated that
                            immediate consideration would be given to our latest proposals and that
                            they would be taken up at once with President Ortiz who, he said was
                            taking an active interest in the negotiations. This gave me an
                            opportunity to suggest to Cantilo that I should like to go with him to
                            see the President with a view to assuring him personally that we have
                            made every effort to make an agreement possible. The Foreign Minister
                            appeared to react favorably to this suggestion, but he said that it was
                            important that the President should first have had an opportunity to
                            study our proposals.</p>
                        <p>Although a definite appointment with the President was not arranged I
                            again stressed the time element and think it probable that it will be
                            arranged for tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>1. Confirming views expressed to you on the telephone this morning, the
                            situation seems to us to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Argentines insist that they cannot accept the sort of general
                            provisions we want on the basis of our Schedule II offers. Furthermore,
                            they take the position that, while they are willing to accord us
                            genuinely non-discriminatory treatment, the quota and exchange articles
                            which we are insisting upon are far too rigid and do not allow for any
                            flexibility if they get into real exchange difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Our position on the two articles in question, as it has been presented to
                            the Argentines to date, is as follows: On exchange, first, we have
                            agreed to give up the requirement of a single exchange rate. This
                            recession subjects us to the danger of impairment of tariff concessions
                            by special rates, but the Argentines insist that they will not use this
                            measure of flexibility in such a way as to impair the concessions. The
                            freedom of action which Argentina has obtained in this regard does not
                            therefore permit her to take action which materially affects the
                            exchange situation. Second, we have agreed that there may be delays in
                            transfers. Even with clause (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) on a like article
                            basis, we do not believe that there would in practice be much
                            flexibility so far as allocation is concerned, since we interpret this
                            clause to require prompt and complete coverage for any article of United
                            States origin if such treatment <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0300"/>is accorded the like article originating in any third country, and we
                            consider it highly unlikely that Argentina would block payments to the
                            United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Clause (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) as it now stands represents an
                            obligation to provide in principle complete coverage in free exchange
                            for all imports, but it does not make any provision as to the time
                            within which exchange must be provided. It does prevent the application
                            of a compensation requirement or a requirement that funds be invested in
                            the importing country.</p>
                        <p>With reference to quotas, we have previously insisted that the base
                            period be any two consecutive years in the period 1930 to 1937 without
                            exception.</p>
                        <p>The only flexibility which our previous proposals permit is contained in
                            Article XII. If either Government considered that circumstances had
                            arisen which had the effect of nullifying or impairing any object of the
                            agreement or of injuring its industries or commerce, or if it considered
                            that any action taken by the other Government had either of these
                            effects, this article provides broadly two types of remedy. First, in
                            cases where action by the other Government is in question, it can make
                            representations and, if it does not obtain satisfaction, terminate the
                            agreement. For example, this remedy would be available to us if
                            Argentina were to use differential exchange rates in such a way as to
                            impair a concession. Second, and this is particularly of interest to
                            Argentina, if the case involved circumstances beyond the control of
                            either Government, the Government which considered itself injured might
                            wish to seek the relaxation of other provisions of the agreement. For
                            example, Argentina might propose to us the temporary suspension of
                            particular provisions of the agreement or the adoption of some interim
                            arrangement inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. If we did
                            not agree to the Argentine proposals, Argentina could terminate the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Article XII does not in our view authorize deviation from the provisions
                            of the agreement except by mutual consent.</p>
                        <p>In view of the general position, as outlined above, we have felt that the
                            only way in which we can do anything to meet the Argentine viewpoint is
                            to give them some provision under which they would have greater freedom
                            of action. Our latest proposals are designed to do this. However, since
                            we feel that we have already gone very far in meeting their viewpoint,
                            we must reserve the right to take whatever action may be necessary to
                            protect our interests should Argentina abuse this flexibility.</p>

                        <p>9. Confirming my conversation by telephone with Hawkins I had my talk
                            with the President this afternoon. The Foreign Minister was also
                            present. Neither the President nor Cantilo had a formal reply ready to
                            our note of January 2 (I understand this will be ready Monday). The
                            President explained in some detail why it was not possible to accept any
                            form of quotas: in other words, our last proposals had not changed the
                            situation. The President used very much the same arguments as those
                            expressed in the various notes and in conversations with other officials
                            that he did not feel what we were prepared to offer would justify their
                            giving up their present system of import control or give them sufficient
                            opportunity for trade expansion.</p>
                        <p>The President said that there appeared to be a wide misconception in the
                            United States as to the danger offered to American products by competing
                            Argentine products, exports of which he insisted could never seriously
                            threaten our markets. He seemed to feel that the acceptance by Argentina
                            of quotas would tend to confirm this impression that Argentine products
                            could constitute serious competition.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that at some later more auspicious occasion when
                            perhaps world conditions were more settled we might approach the
                            situation again and reach a solution which he felt most important from
                            every point of view. The atmosphere was most friendly and he stressed
                            that in the meantime this temporary check must not be permitted in any
                            way to affect our relations which had never been more cordial.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed to the issuance of a joint communiqué announcing the
                            termination of the negotiations which the Foreign Minister is now
                            preparing using our draft as a basis but making certain changes in the
                            reasons why the Argentine Government found it impossible to accept our
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>In my presence the President told Cantilo that he felt that any further
                            statement issued by the Argentine Government summarizing the
                            negotiations should be brief and not go into detail as to individual
                            offers, et cetera.</p>

                                1940, the Department issued a preliminary statement saying that
                                trade agreement negotiations between the United States and Argentina
                                had broken down and that an official statement by the two

                                the United States and Argentina</hi>

                        <p>In the reciprocal trade negotiations between the Governments of the
                            United States and Argentina, notwithstanding the efforts of both
                            parties, it has not been found possible to reach a satisfactory basis to
                            permit the conclusion of an agreement, and the two Governments have
                            agreed to terminate them.</p>
                        <p>In effect the Argentine Government on the one hand has not been able to
                            admit that concessions to be obtained from the United States for their
                            typical regular export products to that country, such as linseed and
                            canned beef, among others, should be restricted through the acceptance
                            of a system of customs quotas which would tend to limit the possibility
                            of expanding its shipments of said products to that country. At the same
                            time it has not been possible to accede to the adoption of commitments
                            considered incompatible with an adequate financial policy and of the
                            defense of the currency.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Government of the United States, in accordance
                            with its policy as invariably applied in the 22 agreements already
                            negotiated, of not exposing domestic producers to material injury in the
                            process of promoting healthy international trade through reciprocal
                            concessions, has felt obliged to insist on limitations of the kind
                            referred to above with respect to certain commodities.</p>
                        <p>This divergence between the two Governments is recognized by both in the
                            same frank and friendly spirit which has characterized the whole
                            negotiations.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the termination of the
                            trade-agreement negotiations with the Argentine Government, I have the
                            honor to submit certain observations of a somewhat general and
                            background nature as to the causes which in my opinion contributed to
                            the failure to reach an agreement.</p>

                        <p rend="center">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Conditions Prevailing in the Two
                                Countries at the Time the Official Negotiations Were
                            Initiated</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>As the Embassy has reported in various despatches, the situation so far
                            as Argentina was concerned seemed particularly favorable for the opening
                            of negotiations when in August last the decision was reached to proceed.
                            The Foreign Minister, Dr. Cantilo, having perhaps profited by the lesson
                            of the Lima Conference and the unfavorable reaction in this country to
                            his somewhat cavalier attitude and obstructionist tactics on that
                            occasion, seemed anxious to show his conversion to the inter-American
                            program. The Patagonian incident last April,<note n="44" xml:id="d308fn44">The alleged German designs on Patagonia.</note>
                            bringing into relief Nazi tactics in Argentina, doubtless contributed
                            toward this change in front on the part of the Foreign Minister, whose
                            years as Ambassador at Borne had left him somewhat under the spell of
                            the totalitarian doctrines. A trade agreement with the United States,
                            aside from contributing to Dr. Cantilo’s personal prestige, would have
                            been the best proof of his entry into the Pan American fold.</p>
                        <p>As to the President, Dr. Ortiz in his speech at the opening of the
                            Argentine Congress last May, had gone on record as favoring multilateral
                            as opposed to the bilateral principles in trade relations, insisting
                            that only circumstances beyond his Government’s control had forced
                            Argentina into acceptance of the latter system, but that when conditions
                            permitted they would return to the freer method. Furthermore, there were
                            clear indications from the internal political aspect that the President
                            desired closer relations with the powerful Radical Party and that he was
                            determined to accord increasing recognition to that party’s numerical
                            strength in the country. Here again, a trade agreement with the United
                            States would be a clear indication of his Government’s liberal
                            tendencies and a move calculated to gain the support of the Radicals,
                            whose sympathy for the United States had never been concealed.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, while the passage of time so far as Argentina was
                            concerned seemed to be working in favor of the opening of the
                            negotiations, in our own country the opposite was the case. The
                            production in the United States of linseed, the principal product
                            shipped by Argentina to the United States and on which Argentina relied
                            in large measure to gain its dollar exchange, had in the past year or so
                            increased greatly and measures for protection of the local industry now
                            seemed necessary, where previously no such restrictions would,
                            presumably, have been considered essential. Furthermore, the necessity
                            of awaiting the closing of our Congress, which was delayed until July,
                            1939, before announcing the opening of negotiations, and the further
                            necessity of reaching an agreement before the opening of the next
                            session <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0304"/>in January, left
                            comparatively little time in which to negotiate, particularly when one
                            took into account the somewhat protracted procedure called for under the
                            Trade Agreements Act. As later events proved, this time element was one
                            of the principal factors contributing to the failure of the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">The Role of the Central Bank</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>From the beginning it was evident that if the negotiations were to
                            succeed, this would depend, so far as Argentina was concerned, largely
                            upon how far higher officials here, notably the President and Foreign
                            Minister, took matters into their own hands and out of the hands of
                            certain functionaries, particularly of the Central Bank, headed by Dr.
                            Raúl Prebisch, whose influence in the past had always been directed
                            against any change in the existing procedure of exchange control and
                            bilateralism.</p>
                        <p>In my first meeting with Dr. Ortiz, confirmed in later conversations, I
                            was encouraged to believe that the President was determined to take
                            charge of the negotiations himself, or in any case to see to it that a
                            narrower, technical point of view of a prejudicial nature should not
                            prevail. However, these hopes did not prove to be justified, and there
                            is reason to believe that Dr. Prebisch’s strong influence, more
                            particularly his apparent insistence upon the bilateral test of trade
                            balancing being applied as the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>, was
                            a very important factor in bringing about the failure.</p>
                        <p>I have little doubt in my own mind that, from the beginning, Dr. Prebisch
                            was skeptical as to the possibility, if not actually opposed to the
                            idea, of a trade agreement with the United States. If he finally gave
                            his consent to the attempt, it was doubtless with the understanding that
                            the <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> offered would have to be a high
                            one and sufficient to balance the trade between the two countries
                            following the increase in imports from the United States that would
                            result from the removal of the existing discriminatory measures. In
                            other words, Dr. Prebisch was envisaging the continuance of the old
                            policy of bilateral balancing of trade. Again and again in the
                            negotiations and even in the final communiqué announcing the failure,
                            this point of view of Dr. Prebisch was ever to the front.</p>
                        <p>I have no desire to be unfair to Dr. Prebisch who, I am convinced, has
                            what he considers to be the best interests of his country at heart and
                            who has undoubtedly acted in accordance with his convictions. His
                            background is almost entirely European. He very possibly feels (and it
                            is a feeling that, frankly, I have seen reflected among officials of
                            other countries, notably, in Canada during our trade-agreement
                            negotiations there) that, even admitting the possibility of increasing
                            exports to the American market, there is no assurance of permanence <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0305"/>of that market, particularly
                            with the Trade Agreements Act subject to renewal by Congress every three
                            years. Dr. Prebisch’s reasoning very probably followed these lines—if
                            the price offered for the agreement was high, the Argentine Government
                            might do well to consider such an agreement, but before doing so it
                            should make sure that Argentina would not lose markets which it already
                            had and which, barring unforeseen incidents, should be left open to it
                            on a permanent basis. While one may not admit his premise as correct or
                            agree with the reasoning, one must concede Dr. Prebisch’s right to hold
                            honest convictions.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, Dr. Prebisch is not only a man holding strong views
                            himself, but also an able person who is in a position to impress those
                            views upon others, as became more and more evident as the negotiations
                            progressed. Dr. Alfredo Louro, head of the Exchange Control Office and
                            generally considered a fair-minded and honest official, apparently well
                            disposed toward the United States and thought to be sincerely desirous
                            of seeing an agreement reached, nevertheless was evidently never free of
                            the influence of Prebisch’s stronger character; not to mention the fact
                            that he probably had also his own personal future to consider. Dr.
                            Torriani, the Foreign Office representative on the Subcommittee, very
                            obviously, as time went on, reflected more and more the views of the
                            Central Bank and was able to impress these on the Foreign Minister. Dr.
                            Cantilo, I am convinced for reasons stated earlier in this despatch,
                            really desired to see an agreement reached. On the other hand, he had
                            little grasp of the details of the negotiations and the issues at stake,
                            which made it extremely difficult to discuss questions with him and I
                            soon found out that Dr. Torriani’s views were being accepted, apparently
                            without question, by Dr. Cantilo.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there was Dr. Irigoyen,<note n="45" xml:id="d308fn45">C. Alonso
                                Irigoyen, Financial Counselor, Argentine Embassy.</note> and here
                            the conversion to the Prebisch view-point was as complete as it was
                            perhaps unexpected. Dr. Irigoyen when he arrived from Washington early
                            in August seemed reasonably objective in his attitude. He appeared to
                            see both sides; to understand our difficulties and to be anxious and
                            willing to act as interpreter of them to the members of his own
                            delegation. There was reason to believe, too, that he felt then that the
                            conclusion of an agreement would be an important feather in his cap and
                            would favorably serve his career. And yet, before the negotiations
                            ended, it is doubtful whether Dr. Prebisch himself was more adamant in
                            his demands or more insistent that acceptance of the Argentine
                            view-point, particularly on quotas, was necessary for any agreement. In
                            fact, as I reported to the Department (telegram no. 273, December 12, 6

                                Sterling</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>The declaration of war in Europe shortly after the opening of the
                            negotiations was certainly a factor which cannot be overlooked in
                            discussing the causes leading to the failure, for it undoubtedly
                            introduced a new and complicating element. First of all, it soon became
                            apparent that, at least for the duration of the war, Argentina would
                            have to look to the United States as a market for many of the products
                            it had been accustomed to find in Europe, notably in the belligerent
                            countries. This meant, of course, finding somewhere more dollar exchange
                            for its increased purchases from the United States, which could be
                            accomplished only in three ways: (1) through increased exports to the
                            United States; (2) by using favorable balances resulting from its
                            exports to European and other countries, notably Great Britain and
                            France, and (3) through loans or credits either from the Export-Import
                            Bank, or private banking sources in the United States.</p>
                        <p>That the British did not intend to lose Argentina as a market for their
                            goods early became apparent. On his return from Great Britain during the
                            early part of our negotiations, the President of the local British
                            Chamber of Commerce, Major William A. McCallum, made an emphatic
                            statement to the effect that Great Britain intended to continue to
                            retain Argentina as a market and that the local British representatives
                            could count on full support of their Government to that end.</p>
                        <p>The course for Argentina to pursue seemed clearly indicated. It was in a
                            strong position. More than ever the British needed Argentine meat and
                            wheat, particularly the former. While Argentina would naturally continue
                            to purchase what it required from England and what England was in a
                            position to supply, it seemed only reasonable that it should be free to
                            use the balance over and above such purchases elsewhere, notably in the
                            United States. How far the Argentine Government pressed its case in this
                            respect is difficult to say. It is known that some form of temporary
                            agreement on sterling blockage was signed, to expire on January 23,
                            1940. An official of the British Embassy made the statement to a member
                            of the Embassy staff on September 21 that the Argentine Government
                            (perhaps meaning the Central Bank) had itself suggested the idea to the
                            British Government of blocking sterling balances. As the Department is
                            aware, at one point in the negotiations the possibility of securing our
                            assistance in endeavoring to persuade the British Government to take a
                            more liberal view in the matter was discussed informally with certain
                            members of the Argentine Subcommittee. It was in fact <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0307"/>suggested by one of the Argentine
                            delegates that we ask the Central Bank for details as to the status of
                            its agreement with the British and this request was informally made, but
                            no answer was ever received. The Department’s intervention with the
                            British Government was also proposed by the Embassy (see Embassy’s
                            telegrams no. 216 of November 3, 3 p.m., no. 230 of November 21, 10
                            a.m., and no. 253 of December 4, 8 p.m.<note n="47" xml:id="d308fn47">None printed.</note>), but for reasons undoubtedly sound, the
                            Department thought it best to restrict its representations to a request
                            through the Embassy at London for information as to the status of the
                            situation. The reply from London, it will be remembered (transmitted to
                            this Embassy in the Department’s telegram no. 223 of November 18, 4
                                p.m.<note n="48" xml:id="d308fn48">Not printed.</note>), while of a
                            somewhat negative nature so far as the British Government was concerned,
                            indicated that Argentina’s position, if the country wished to take
                            advantage of it, was a strong one.</p>
                        <p>In any case, the alleged inability to secure free exchange from the
                            British undoubtedly was used by Dr. Prebisch as a strong argument with
                            his own Government justifying insistence upon the maximum tariff
                            concessions from the United States.</p>
                        <p>While there is no reason to believe that the British Government
                            officially or even indirectly did anything affirmatively to prevent an
                            agreement between Argentina and ourselves from being reached, the fact
                            that it failed to commit itself as to the future regarding the action it
                            proposed to take on such sterling balances as might result from its
                            large purchases in Argentina was certainly an important factor. Nor can
                            there be overlooked the arrival in Buenos Aires of a Director of the
                            Bank of England, Mr. Guy Watson, on November 20, during the
                            negotiations, and the fact that he is reported to have been given a desk
                            in the Central Bank here and to have been consulted on all occasions by
                            Dr. Prebisch (see Embassy’s telegram no. 16, January 10, 6 p.m.<note n="48" xml:id="d308fn1">Not printed.</note>). This factor seems the
                            more significant when one considers that it was about that time that the
                            Argentine delegation, or those members of it most closely associated
                            with Dr. Prebisch, first began to show signs of pessimism as to the
                            possibility of our negotiations being brought to a successful
                            conclusion—a pessimism shortly reflected in the view-point of the
                            Foreign Minister himself. Finally, mention must be made of the
                            now-famous exchange-control circular and the oral explanatory statement
                            of Dr. Louro, reported in <hi rend="italic">La Nation</hi> the day
                            following.</p>
                        <p>So much for personalities and background. I have gone into some detail as
                            it seems important for the future that the Department should have as
                            complete a picture as possible of the personalities with whom we have
                            had to deal; and presumably will have to deal in the <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0308"/>event that, at some later date, another
                            attempt to reach an agreement is made.</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Our Schedule II Offers</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>As to the more immediate and direct causes of the failure to reach an
                            agreement, these can be discussed in a few paragraphs. Our Schedule II
                            offers when first presented on November 15 received a fairly good
                            reception by the Argentine Subcommittee. There is little doubt that the
                            Argentines considered them a first offer: that we would be prepared to
                            go much further. The Latin American, perhaps particularly the Argentine,
                            has a good deal of the Chinaman in his makeup. When it became evident
                            that we were not prepared to make important improvements they were
                            apparently genuinely surprised, almost to the point of indignation. Not
                            only were we not prepared to make further concessions—sufficiently
                            important in their view—but our original Schedule II offer as regards
                            canned beef, one of the most important commodities, was later changed by
                            the imposition of a quota—coupled, to be sure, with a reduction in the
                            ad valorem duty from 30%to 20%.</p>
                        <p>To make matters more difficult for our negotiators, there was the time
                            element. In the Department’s telegram no. 231 of November 29, 6 p.m. the
                            Embassy was instructed to make it clear to the Argentine negotiators
                            that our position was not a bargaining one, and that any effort on their
                            part to maintain what appeared to us to be an extreme bargaining
                            position could only result in unnecessary delay; furthermore, that a
                            decision on their part regarding our offers would have to be made
                            promptly. This point of view was presented to the Argentine Government
                            in a note to the Foreign Office, and, although the language employed was
                            as tactfully worded as possible, I feel that it was from about this time
                            that the atmosphere changed from a friendly and optimistic one to one of
                            aloofness and pessimism. In fact, it was shortly after receipt of this
                            note that it became impossible to arrange further meetings for our
                            Subcommittee with the Argentine Subcommittee, and from then on
                            negotiations had perforce to be conducted through notes and memoranda.
                            In my last talk with the President, Dr. Ortiz mentioned early December
                            (a date more or less coinciding with the delivery of the Embassy’s note)
                            as the period when he felt the cordial atmosphere that had hitherto
                            prevailed in our negotiations changed to one of haste and pressure. The
                            Latin American does not understand the need for hurry. He interprets it
                            as an attempt to put pressure on him. From the beginning of the
                            negotiations we had all done our best to make it clear to the Argentines
                            how essential it was that negotiations should be completed before
                            Christmas, in other words, before the re-convening of Congress. They
                            professed to understand; but looking back, it seems doubtful whether
                            they fully appreciated this point.</p>
                        <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0309"/>
                        <p>To return to the question of canned beef, from the tactical point of
                            view, so to speak, the imposition of a quota on that product added
                            greatly to our difficulties here. As the Department is aware, canned
                            beef, of all products on the Argentine list, is the most controversial
                            one, politically at any rate, in Argentina, as bringing back unhappy
                            memories of the unratified sanitary convention and the “canned beef for
                            the Navy” controversy. It also furnished further justification for those
                            in favor of rejecting our proposals on the ground of the quota on
                            linseed. Had the Argentine Government been forced to base its refusal on
                            the linseed quota alone this might have been a more difficult thesis to
                            maintain, but in being able to join to this a quota on canned beef it
                            was enabled not only to rally the support of other members of its
                            representation, but to present its case in a more logical light to the
                            public, as it began to do even prior to the termination of the
                            negotiations and as it has continued to do.</p>
                        <p>However, even admitting the above, had the Department felt justified in
                            removing the quota on linseed, this concession might, and probably
                            would, have still made an agreement possible. A quota on linseed had of
                            course been included in our original Schedule II offers, but as already
                            stated, this product, above all others, was relied upon by the
                            Argentines to furnish their dollar exchange. Dr. Alberto Bonfante,
                            following the termination of the negotiations, suggested that had we
                            raised the linseed quota to 15,000,000 bushels this even might have been
                            enough. Such an increased offer, however, would had to have been
                            submitted with sufficient time for the Argentine Government to consider
                            it adequately and to realize that we had really gone as far as we
                            intended to go.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>Referring again to the time element, I should be lacking in frankness
                            were I not to stress the unfortunate effect of this factor. It will be
                            remembered that our last note to the Argentine Government, insisting
                            that we could go no further in our offers, was delivered on the night of
                            January 2. This reply required—or the Argentine Government considered
                            that it required—a reply formally to conclude the negotiations one way
                            or the other. I was informed that the Department must have a definite
                            reply not later than January 5, either orally or in writing. Every
                            attempt was made by Dr. Cantilo to arrange to have this reply ready to
                            be delivered to me when I saw the President on January 5. This was found
                            to be impossible, however, and in my final talk with the President and
                            Dr. Cantilo I was orally informed that they would be unable to recede
                            from their position in insistence upon removal of the quotas on linseed
                            and canned beef. In announcing the breaking-off of the negotiations
                            immediately following this interview, Dr. Cantilo referred to them as
                            being merely suspended <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0310"/>until
                            the international situation cleared, and the following day President
                            Ortiz made a statement more or less to the same effect. I believe that
                            the wording used by the President and the Foreign Minister was merely
                            what they considered the amenities of the occasion required. When,
                            therefore, the Department instructed me to insist that in the joint
                            communiqué not only must the negotiations be referred to as terminated,
                            but also the words “with no plan or understanding as to their renewal”
                            be added, both the President and Dr. Cantilo, I fear, interpreted this
                            as unnecessarily abrupt and even ungracious. In fact, Dr. Cantilo told
                            me so in as many words. The Department later consented to the
                            elimination of the additional phrase referred to, but I fear that much
                            of the harm had been done. Again, I would not wish to give the
                            impression of not understanding the extremely difficult position in
                            which the Administration at home found itself. But this is intended as
                            an objective report, and I am merely recording what I feel to be the
                            impression created. To be sure, it is quite possible that, as the
                            internal political situation at home made it imperative that no grounds
                            for belief should be given that the negotiations were merely suspended
                            for the time being, President Ortiz and the Government here for internal
                            political reasons also were reluctant to give the impression that the
                            negotiations were definitely terminated, not to be reopened at some
                            later date. If this is true, then it is, perhaps, a hopeful sign as to
                            the possibilities for the future, should another attempt to reach an
                            agreement be made.</p>
                        <p>As I note that a memorandum of my last conversation with the President,
                            summarized in the Embassy’s telegram no. 9 of January 5, 9 p.m., has not
                            been forwarded to the Department, I am sending it herewith as an

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister<note n="1" xml:id="d311fn1">Luis Fernando
                                Guachalla.</note> called to see me this afternoon. The Minister
                            stated that he had been considerably disturbed by the nature of the
                            first press reports which had come up from South America with regard to
                            the change of government in Bolivia recently decreed by President Busch.
                            The Minister said that these articles had referred to the new form of
                            government installed as “totalitarian”, and that this gave a completely
                            erroneous impression to the average American citizen. He said that he
                            had given yesterday a statement to the press in clarification of the
                            situation, and that his statement has been reinforced today <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0312"/>by an official statement issued by the
                            President of Bolivia to the effect that there was not the slightest
                            sympathy on the part of the Bolivian people nor on the part of the
                            Bolivian Government with either Nazi or Fascist ideology, and that the
                            change of government had been undertaken solely for domestic
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Minister that I greatly appreciated his clarification and
                            that I was glad to see this morning that the press reports gave an
                            entirely different coloring from that which they contained yesterday. I
                            said that of course it was regrettable that the first reports had been
                            of this character because the editorials which had now been published on
                            the change of government were all of them based on the original Teports
                            and the effect on public opinion was naturally disquieting.</p>
                        <p>The Minister explained to me at some length what he considered “were the
                            real reasons for the change of government. He said that when he had
                            recently been in Bolivia he had learned that the three ‘classic
                            political parties of Bolivia—the Liberal Party and the two factions of
                            the Republican Party—had reached a common alignment for the purpose of
                            retaining the present Congress in power and of modifying the
                            Constitution through the agency of the present Congress. … At the same
                            time, the Minister said, there were certain influences at work within
                            the Army trying to persuade President Busch to set up a dictatorial
                            government composed solely of Army officers similar to the type of
                            government in power during the last years of the Chaco war.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that either of these two tendencies would inevitably,
                            if successful, be highly prejudicial to the best interests of the
                            Bolivian people, and he was hopeful that President Busch would adopt a
                            middle course and hold fair national elections in the near future, as he
                            had now publicly announced he would do, and that as a result of these
                            elections the Government would obtain a reasonable measure of support
                            but would at the same time have within the Congress a healthy opposition
                            which would tend to ensure a return to civil rather than military
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The Minister further stated that he considered the retention of the
                            previous Cabinet in office a healthy sign, and that he was personally
                            very much disturbed by the announcement that certain basic decree laws
                            would be promulgated which would modify very greatly the traditional
                            form of constitutional government of Bolivia. He said that he had asked
                            for information on this point by cable from La Paz and that he wished me
                            to know that if he found that such was really the intention of the
                            present Bolivian Government, he would find it necessary to return at
                            once to La Paz and if he could not succeed in <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0313"/>changing that decision he would be
                            forced to resign his position as Minister here.</p>
                        <p>The Minister also stated that in the alignment of the three political
                            parties, of which he had previously Spoken, one of the chief planks was
                            a violent attack against the Bolivian Government for the peace
                                treaty<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">Signed at Buenos Aires July 21,

                                p. 331.</note> entered into with Paraguay. In other words, the
                            political parties were making capital out of the peace treaty between
                            Bolivia and Paraguay, urging revision of the treaty so that Bolivia
                            would obtain more than she had obtained through the treaty. The Minister
                            stated that of course this would be utterly fatal to any progressive
                            rehabilitation of Bolivia both in the economic sense as well as in the
                            international sense, and that if such a policy were pursued he would of
                            course oppose it with all the means within his power.</p>

                            title of President of Bolivia. Also, it is noted that President Busch’s
                            Cabinet remains unchanged. Apparently the main change in the Bolivian
                            form of government is that President Busch has assumed “complete power
                            in the state” and has dissolved the Bolivian Congress. That is to say,
                            President Busch is still the head of the Bolivian Government but has
                            taken to himself more extensive governmental power than he had

                                    extending recognition to the present government. It seems to me
                                    that the question whether the abrogation of the former
                                    Constitution and the promulgation of a new one, and the
                                    continuance of President Vargas in <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0314"/>office under the new Constitution have been
                                    brought about by appropriate processes is a matter primarily for
                                    consideration by that country and its people. The situation is
                                    not analogous to that presented where the recognized government
                                    has been ousted by a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> or
                                    revolution and a new régime set up contrary to constitutional

                        <p>From the facts of the Bolivian case, as heretofore presented, there would
                            apparently be no cause for this Government to go through any formal act
                            of recognition. As in the Brazilian case, the continuance of our
                            relations with the Bolivian Government will, it is believed, amount to a
                            continuance of recognition of the present régime in Bolivia. The terms
                            “recognize” and “recognition” are used in two senses with regard to
                            foreign governments: (1) with reference to an act or declaration
                            indicating an intention to deal with a completely new régime as the
                            government of a state, and (2) an act or series of acts indicating an
                            intention to continue to deal with a government already recognized.
                            While considerable changes in the Government of Bolivia were recently
                            made by President Busch, it seems reasonable to hold that the Government
                            now in control is a continuation of the Government which was carried on
                            under him before the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>, especially in
                            view of the fact that his cabinet has not been changed.</p>

                            a hypothetical question, may I inquire your opinion as to whether an act

                            May 3 would be necessary in case a president were not only to dismiss
                            the congress and annul the constitution, but to set up an entirely new
                            regime upon totally different concepts.</p>

                            government, would recognition be necessary or unnecessary? Is there a
                            line that can be drawn between changes in government which appear to be
                            a continuation of the previous government and a change of government in
                            which, while the president may remain the same, the whole bases of the
                            political, economic and social structure of the country are altered?</p>

                        <p>53. In proclamation assuming office Quintanilla announced that he did so
                            “by the will of the Armed Forces and with the unanimous approval of the
                            members of the Cabinet”. While under the Constitution the Vice President
                            should succeed, Busch retained that document in effect only in so far as
                            it did not interfere with his dictatorial powers. Vice President
                            apparently has taken no active steps to claim Presidency and Quintanilla
                            seems to have support of army and country under control, no disturbances
                            having been reported.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of Congress the Cabinet was the only organized political
                            body in Bolivia. Since the new Government is a dictatorship taking over
                            from the old one with the support of the same elements it is my opinion
                            that relations with it should continue without any necessity for <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            recognition but I should appreciate instructions from the Department on
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>Cabinet has resigned “to leave President free to choose his
                            collaborators”. I am informed in strict confidence that new Cabinet will
                            be composed of four generals and six civilians, Ministries of Health and
                            Propaganda being abolished. Four of old Cabinet retained. Appointments
                            of particular interest are Ostria Gutierrez as Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs and General Rivera now Minister of War as Minister <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0317"/>of Mines and Petroleum. Poumont remains
                            as Minister of Finance as sop to Leftist elements but probably only for
                            a short period.</p>

                        <p>24. Your no. 53, August 25, 3 p.m. While the Department has noted that
                            the new Government does not appear to differ materially in form from
                            that of Busch, it is not clear whether its policies will be the same.
                            The substance of any formal statements concerning policy should
                            immediately be telegraphed to the Department, together with your
                            comments. In the absence of further information I believe a decision
                            whether the question of recognition is involved would be premature; what
                            is the attitude of other governments in that connection?</p>
                        <p>Have the circumstances surrounding the death of Busch been clarified?</p>

                        <p>54. Department’s telegram No. 24, August 26, 5 p.m. In his proclamation
                            assuming Provisional Presidency August 23 Quintanilla stated “My
                            government will continue the social and economic policies and courses of
                            the government of Colonel Busch”. From the changes in the Cabinet and
                            his own tendencies it is the Legation’s opinion that the new Government
                            will probably be more conservative.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of A.B.C. nations<note n="11" xml:id="d319fn11">Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.</note> Great Britain, Germany, Japan
                            and most other governments are continuing normal relations with the
                            Provisional Government. Only contrary attitude appears to be that of
                            French Minister who has no instructions but says that he will recommend
                            against recognition of Quintanilla.</p>
                        <p>There appears to be little doubt that Busch committed suicide in a state
                            of melancholia to which he was subject.</p>
                        <p>New Cabinet took oath of office yesterday afternoon. Composition as
                            indicated in my telegram No. 53, August 25, 3 p.m. except that it has 11
                            members, 6 retained. Foianini and Herrero not in Cabinet.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Briggs</hi>: While I believe that the question
                            of recognition does come up in the present case in Bolivia, it might be
                            prudent, in view of the world situation, simply to continue relations
                            with the Quintanilla government. When Busch took over the government on
                            April 24, 1939 and dissolved the Congress, he was the constitutionally
                            elected president and it was decided that the question of recognition
                            was not involved. However, in the present case, if the constitution
                            should be in effect the Vice President, Enrique Baldivieso, would
                            normally become President. Since he did not and since Quintanilla
                            announced that he assumed office “by the will of the armed forces and
                            with the unanimous approval of the members of the Cabinet”, there
                            appears to have been a definite break in … normal procedure … in
                            Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The true nature of the new Government is difficult to judge as
                            Quintanilla is strongly pro-German but the return of Ostria Gutierrez to
                            the Cabinet is encouraging as the Legation had reported that his
                            resignation was motivated not only by his disagreement with the
                            nationalization of the Central Bank “but also by his lack of sympathy
                            with the general policies of the Government, somewhat too radical for a
                            middle-of-the-roader of his tendencies” (despatch no. 595, August 4<note n="12" xml:id="d320fn12">Not printed.</note>). …</p>
                        <p>I have therefore drafted the attached telegram<note n="13" xml:id="d320fn13">

                        <p>55. The Legation’s telegram number 54, August 27, 5 p.m. British Minister
                            has now received instructions to take no action at present tending to
                            recognize Provisional Government.</p>

                            at 5 p.m. tomorrow. It is my interpretation that I should not attend in

                        <p>Manifesto of Baldivieso claiming Presidency is circulating today but I do
                            not believe he has any chance of assuming power. General unpopularity of
                            and pressure on Quintanilla is such, however, that it seems likely he
                            will resign shortly and be replaced by Bilbao, Commander-in-Chief and
                            strongest man in the army.</p>

                        <p>279. The Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me this morning a telegram
                            from his Legation at La Paz recommending that normal relations be
                            continued with the Bolivian Government and that the question of
                            recognition be not raised. Aranha observed that it was his intention to
                            adopt that course and he remarked that he hoped that the Department of
                            State would not raise a question of recognition either but would
                            continue normal relations.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister called this afternoon on instructions from his
                            Government to state that the Quintanilla administration did not
                            represent “a continuation of the dictatorship of General Busch”. Dr.
                            Guachalla pointed out that Señor Baldivieso, the Vice President under
                            Señor Busch, had not assumed the Provisional Presidency and that the new
                            Government desired to return to constitutional procedure “at an early
                            date”. The Minister said that no date had been indicated but he assumed
                            this would mean “two or three months”. The Minister continued by stating
                            that his Government desired to continue the very friendly and cordial
                            relations at present existing with the Government of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I thanked Dr. Guachalla for his Government’s courtesy in conveying the
                            foregoing message and told him that it was equally our desire to
                            continue close relations with his Government. I gathered from the
                            Minister’s attitude that he was relieved to find that no question of
                            recognition had arisen.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then mentioned the reappointment of Dr. Ostria Gutierrez as
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs and said that to his personal knowledge the
                            Minister was very desirous of reaching a solution of the oil
                            controversy. I agreed that the continued existence of this controversy
                            represented a cloud on the horizon of our relations and expressed the
                            hope that every effort would be made in the direction of an early
                            solution.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister<note n="14" xml:id="d327fn14">Luis Fernando
                                Guachalla.</note> stated that his Government desired to enter into
                            discussions to secure a credit from this Government. In response to my
                            inquiries as to additional details concerning the desire of the Bolivian
                            Government, the Minister was unable to furnish further information. I
                            informed the Minister, first, that it would be necessary for the
                            Bolivian Government to present concrete proposals to this Government for
                            its consideration, and secondly, that it appeared to me very doubtful
                            whether this Government would wish to extend credits to the Bolivian
                            Government until that Government had taken steps to clear up certain
                            well known differences with American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he agreed that it would probably be difficult,
                            if not impossible, for this Government to move in the credit matter
                            until the differences were straightened out. In this connection he
                            inquired whether, as a result of further discussions between the
                            Department and the Standard Oil Company, he could expect to receive in
                            the near future a new draft of the proposed settlement.<note n="15" xml:id="d327fn15">See <ref target="#pg_322">pp. 322</ref> ff.</note>
                            I informed the Minister that I had not had an opportunity to acquaint
                            myself with the status of the negotiations concerning the Standard Oil
                            dispute since my return, but that I would do so and inform him next
                            Monday when he returned to town.</p>
                        <p>The Minister informed me that he would request further information from
                            his Government as to its interests in a fcredit and what the credit
                            would be used for if granted, et cetera.</p>

                        <p>5. I had an interesting talk this morning with the Bolivian delegation in
                            regard to economic and financial cooperation. The Bolivian Government
                            apparently faces a serious possibility of exchange <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0322"/>difficulties because of the
                            disturbances created by the war in Europe. They state that it would be
                            very helpful to them if they could secure a moderate sized advance, say
                            in the amount of two millions of dollars. They state that part of this
                            sum would be used to purchase American products.</p>
                        <p>The first idea which they had arose out of the fact that there is now an
                            appropriation of 10 million dollars for the purchase of strategic raw
                            materials. They had been informed, and I confirmed the information, that
                            a substantial part of this appropriation would be used for the purchase
                            of tin. The idea that was put forward was that the payment for the tin
                            to be bought as strategic reserve would pay any advance made to them. A
                            promise was given that this possibility would be explored. At the same
                            time, however, various difficulties were pointed out; particularly, (1)
                            The comparatively rigid procedure which the Army and Navy Board was
                            required to follow under the law for the purchase of these strategic raw
                            materials. (2) The question of grades of tin. Would you please look into
                            the various sides of this matter as promptly as possible and advise us
                            as to whether any arrangement of this type might be practicable. In
                            anticipation of possible practical difficulties, we suggested to the
                            Bolivian delegation that an advance might be simpler and much more
                            quickly arranged either through the Export-Import Bank or the RFC<note n="17" xml:id="d328fn17">Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</note>
                            without establishing any direct connection with purchases of tin for the
                            strategic reserve. Without commitment the Bolivian delegation was told
                            that we would submit the following possible arrangement—the advancement
                            of the agreed upon sum, say 2 millions of dollars, immediately. The
                            Bolivian Government would give notes which would call for repayment in
                            monthly installments beginning say 4 months after the advance. Each of
                            these monthly installments would be at least the proceeds received from
                            the sale of a minimum amount of Bolivian tin through the official
                            Mineral Bank of Bolivia. The amount mentioned in that connection though
                            tentatively was 200 tons a month which at current prices would be
                            repayment at approximately $200,000 a month. The Bolivian Government
                            might be willing to give the bank actual tin security in some form. The
                            Bolivian delegation also mentioned the possibility of including
                            antimony, wolfram ore, or tungsten as part of the arrangement. If this
                            security seems satisfactory as tin, the total amount could be somewhat
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question as to the interest rate, the Bolivian
                            delegation was informed that, for an advance of approximately this
                            period, it was thought that the bank would be willing to make either a 3
                            per cent or at most a 3½ per cent rate.</p>
                        <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0323"/>
                        <p>It occurs to us that this matter might be handled expeditiously if the
                            Mineral Bank of Bolivia created a subordinate American branch in the
                            United States. The funds could then be advanced to this branch, when and
                            as needed, to pay for the purchase of American goods or other purposes,
                            as agreed upon. The Bolivian Government and the Mineral Bank would
                            pledge themselves to the Import and Export Bank to provide the American
                            branch with a minimum of 200 tons of tin a month or the equivalent
                            amount in dollars each month.</p>
                        <p>Will the Department please discuss this whole possibility also with
                                Pierson<note n="18" xml:id="d328fn18">Warren L. Pierson, President,
                                Export-Import Bank of Washington.</note> and Jones?<note n="19" xml:id="d328fn19">Jesse H. Jones, Chairman, Board of Directors,
                                Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</note> It will be most helpful
                            to us if the Department’s reply can set forth the actual details of a
                            possible transaction which could be confirmed in all ways except final
                            arrangements of documents and signature while we are in Panama if the
                            Bolivian Government wishes to take the necessary steps that
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>If we succeed in working out this measure of financial cooperation with
                            Bolivia, I am hopeful that it would be the basis of a joint statement
                            that the two Governments could make as regards economic and financial
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian delegation also raised the question of possible help for
                            either Central Bank or exchange stabilization purposes. They were
                            informed that this was a matter of most careful technical examination
                            and that if they would submit a memorandum to us we would bring to the
                            attention of the Treasury which would certainly be glad to discuss it
                            with the Minister upon its return to Washington.</p>

                        <p>31. Department is giving serious consideration to a request of Bolivian
                            Delegation at Panama for an immediate advance to meet exchange
                            difficulties. Please supply details regarding the exchange situation
                            which is alleged to create an emergency need for $2,000,000 immediate
                            advance. Bolivia has mentioned possibility of including sales of
                            antimony, wolfram ore or tungsten acquired by the Banco Minero, as well
                            as tin, as security. One set-up under consideration is for repayment in
                            monthly instalments of $200,000 beginning 4 months after the advance.
                            Please telegraph comment on practicability of arranging effective
                            security on sales of these minerals, excluding tin, <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0324"/>in the United States, in view of

                        <p>16. Your 5, September 22, 2 p.m. Can you add any details to your first
                            paragraph references to exchange difficulties and to proposed use of
                            advance? Department is also querying Legation, La Paz, on this. Could
                            Bolivian Foreign Minister<note n="20" xml:id="d330fn20">Alberto Ostria
                                Gutiérrez.</note> have his Government also provide Bolivian Legation
                            here with full information for discussion with this Government?</p>
                        <p>As to the possibility of tying up such an advance to purchases by this
                            Government of tin for reserve stocks, there appears to be no way of
                            modifying the formal procedure specified by the law. The advertisement
                            for bids on approximately 4,000 tons of tin is about to be issued by the
                            Procurement Division of the Treasury. The specifications in the
                            advertisement could be met by London standard tin as well as other high
                            grade tin so that presumably the Mineral Bank of Bolivia could bid for
                            all or a part of this order if it has a claim on high grade standard tin
                            (made in whole or in part from Bolivian ore). It is understood that the
                            bids must be on a c. i. f. basis, however, so that the Mineral Bank
                            would have to commit itself to delivery of the tin in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Should the Mineral Bank be successful in securing a part of this order,
                            it might be possible then to make an advance to the Bolivian Government
                            against fulfillment of the contract with the Procurement Division. Bids
                            will not be opened, however, until 30 days after the date of
                            advertisement. There is no possibility of purchases of tin ore under
                            this program.</p>
                        <p>Pierson has other phases under advisement.</p>

                        <p>18. Our 5, September 22, Department’s 16, September 25.</p>
                        <p>1. The Bolivian delegation has given us an extensive
                                        memorandum<note n="21" xml:id="d331fn21">Not printed.</note>
                                    containing a full account of the development of their present
                                        <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0325"/>exchange position
                                    and difficulties. We are sending this to Washington by airmail
                                    today.</p>
                                <p>The essence of the present difficulty seems to be as follows: The
                                    value of Bolivian currency has been linked to the pound. This
                                    fact has created difficulties in two directions: First,
                                    approximately 60% of Bolivian exports go in the first instance
                                    to Great Britain and are paid for in pounds and approximately
                                    20% to Germany. This means fewer dollars. Second, the decline in
                                    the exchange value of Bolivian currency increases the difficulty
                                    of paying for necessary imports from the United States,
                                    Argentina, Chile and Peru, whose currencies have not declined in
                                    value. These imports are almost entirely necessities.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the serious disturbance both of markets and of
                                    shipping is interfering seriously with Bolivian exports
                                    especially to England.</p>
                                <p>This combination of circumstances—many of which may be entirely
                                    transitory—create an acute exchange situation for Bolivia.
                                    Immediate relief is required.</p>
                                <p>I therefore urge that the Board of Trustees of the Export-Import
                                    Bank immediately authorize an advance of say 2 millions of
                                    dollars to be made to the Bolivian Government conditional upon
                                    the satisfactory agreement upon details to be worked out by the
                                    Executive Committee. If this is done the Bolivian Foreign
                                    Minister and myself can then sign here in Panama an exchange of
                                    letters containing an agreement for this advance in general
                                    terms specifying merely its approximate amount, its approximate
                                    period and its interest, approximate interest rate which suggest
                                    should be no more than 3%. Upon the return of Minister Guachalla
                                    to Washington details could be settled and the necessary formal
                                    papers signed.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to the possibility of Bolivian sales to the
                                    American Government for reserve stock, as soon as the terms of
                                    the advertisement for bids are published will you kindly give
                                    copies to the Bolivian Legation in Washington. It would also be
                                    helpful, if it is practicable, if you would cable to the
                                    American Legation in La Paz the main features of the
                                    advertisement as regards the procedure for placing bids and
                                    instruct the Legation to bring it to the attention of the
                                    Minister of Mines.</p>
                                <p>I recommend that the arrangement outlined in numbered paragraph 1
                                    for an advance to the Bolivian Government be worked out without
                                    waiting to ascertain whether or not the Bolivian Government
                                    secures any of the orders for tin for reserve stock
                                    purposes.</p>
                            <p>3. For your information. The delegation states that it has been
                                informed that the Banco Minero expects to be in a position to assure
                                the export of $100,000 monthly of antimony and wolfram.</p>

                        <p>62. Department’s 31, September 25, 7 p.m. Bolivian exchange difficulties
                            date back to about November 1937 and have only been aggravated by
                            European war. In this period exchange needs have varied from 250,000 to
                            320,000 pounds per month with amount available ranging from 200,000 to
                            260,000 pounds. As a result reserves of Central Bank have been reduced
                            some 500,000 pounds and backlog of about 800,000 pounds of commercial
                            debts abroad has been built up, largely in the United States, for which
                            exchange is not available. In other words, Bolivian exchange needs in
                            approximately 20 months before outbreak of war exceeded exchange
                            receipts by at least 1,000,000 pounds.</p>
                        <p>Because of difficulty of transportation of tin to Europe until convoy
                            system is perfected and adequate shipping is available, Bolivian
                            exchange receipts are expected to be below 100,000 pounds for the next 2
                            to 4 months and it is to make up the deficit in current needs that the
                            advance of $2,000,000 is desired. There is no apparent idea in official
                            circles that any of this would be used to reduce commercial backlog.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Finance estimates that, once tin shipments can be made under
                            satisfactory conditions, Bolivian interests will be receiving 330,000
                            pounds of exchange per month from this source because of increase of tin
                            quota to 100% and at least 70,000 pounds from other sources giving it
                            considerable surplus over its present monthly needs of 320,000 pounds
                            and enabling it easily to repay proposed advance. These optimistic
                            calculations do not take into account possibilities of submarine warfare
                            and other unforeseen war factors. Central Bank still has about 700,000
                            pounds of available reserves in gold and foreign exchange which could be
                            used to tide over period in which exchange from tin will not be coming
                            in if calculations are correct but the Bolivian Government would
                            obviously rather take the gamble on funds secured from the United States
                            than lower the bank’s present reserves to vanishing point.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Finance states that amount of antimony and wolfram ore
                            acquired by Banco Minero is about 400 and that of tungsten about 50 tons
                            per month and these estimates are checked by independent mining
                            authorities. At current prices this would bring about $70,000 per month,
                            totally inadequate security for repayment of contemplated installments
                            of $200,000. Furthermore mining experts estimate that only about half of
                            the ore is of a grade such that it would be acceptable to American
                            importers under normal circumstances. Manager of the Banco Minero states
                            that delivery of amounts indicated could begin in <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0327"/>November if prices offered in the
                            United States were satisfactory but the Department is in a better
                            position than the Legation to judge whether there would be a sufficient
                            market for them there.</p>
                        <p>If the proposed advance is to be seriously considered it is my opinion
                            that more adequate security should be offered such as a lien on the
                            first $200,000 of exchange accruing to the Bolivian Government each
                            month from sales of all minerals abroad whether by the Banco Minero or
                            the big mining groups, beginning 4 months after the advance.</p>
                        <p>I frankly do not see, however, why the Government of the United States
                            should come to the assistance of the Bolivian Government in a situation
                            which has arisen largely because of the latter’s bad financial
                            management and extravagance especially in view of the record of the
                            Bolivian Government in the recent past toward American interests. While
                            the present regime is more amicably disposed than its predecessor it
                            would only be good grace for it to take active measures toward the
                            settlement of certain outstanding problems before asking for aid.</p>

                        <p>22. The Bolivian Foreign Minister asked me again this morning to expedite
                            the decision regarding the advance presented in our No. 18, September
                            26, 8 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate it if the Department could secure a definite reply by
                            Saturday at the latest. In view of the genuineness of the need and the
                            character of the security, I believe it important that an agreement be
                            reached.</p>

                        <p>38. Your no. 5, September 22, 2 p.m., no. 18, September 26, 8 p.m., no.
                            22, September 28, 6 p.m., and no. 28, September 29, 9 p.m. The
                            Department has had great difficulty in finding any basis on which an
                            extension of credit could be justified to public or congressional
                            opinion here. The suggested collateral is imperfect in view of the
                            uncertainty, under recent war conditions, as to the movement of tin, the
                            terms of shipment and payment which will be allowed by Great Britain,
                            the refining country, and the probable loss of identity of the tin
                            before it reaches the United States, while the antimony, wolfram and
                            tungsten shipments would be insufficient in amount, not all of suitable
                            grades, and not in all cases readily marketable in the United States. It
                            would therefore be difficult to relate a credit directly, at the present
                            moment, to American imports of strategic materials, while it seems also
                            that the credit is wanted in considerable measure for purposes other
                            than direct payment for American exports to Bolivia. The Department
                            understands that the Bolivian Central Bank still has about 700,000
                            pounds sterling of available reserves in gold and foreign exchange, so
                            that the need for emergency relief in the suggested form is not
                            absolute.</p>
                        <p>The credit would encounter an outcry in view of Bolivia’s debt record and
                            particularly of the Government’s action with regard to the Standard Oil
                            properties. This morning’s <hi rend="italic">‘New York Herald
                                Tribune</hi> has a very strong editorial on the suggested credit
                            attacking Bolivia on both the debt and the oil questions. This would
                            undoubtedly be the attitude of public opinion and would be taken up by
                            Congress in case governmental credit were granted to Bolivia at this
                            time. The Congress in its present session, convened for discussion of
                            questions of international policy, has already shown itself attentive to
                            every international development. This is another reason why I have been
                            so anxious to see some disposition on the part of the Bolivian
                            Government to deal with the oil difficulty at least. Moreover, last
                            July, in testimony before the Senate Committee on the request for
                            increase in Export-Import Bank lending power, Mr. Pierson and Mr. Jones
                            were asked about Bolivia and replied that they would not make loans to
                            “a country that is confiscating our property”. This was widely quoted in
                            the newspapers.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons the lending authorities would be very reluctant to
                            grant at the present moment a credit which might prejudice the smooth
                            development of the whole plan of financial cooperation, which depends on
                            Congressional action, and I am equally reluctant to press them to act
                            against their judgment.</p>
                        <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0329"/>
                        <p>It is therefore the opinion of this Government that the appropriate
                            method of dealing with this question should be through discussion with a
                            representative of the Bolivian government, preferably the Bolivian
                            Minister, authorized to that effect, and that such discussions be
                            commenced promptly upon his return from Panama. It is not believed that
                            publicity can be other than harmful. It is hoped that under these
                            circumstances the Bolivian government might assist by clarifying the
                            difficulties and uncertainties with which we are necessarily faced.</p>

                        <p>39. For Berle.<note n="22" xml:id="d336fn22">Adolf A. Berle, Assistant
                                Secretary of State.</note> Your No. 38, September 30, 4 p.m. I have
                            availed myself of the authorization contained in the last paragraph of
                            the Department’s telegram to suggest to the Bolivian Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs that he instruct Guachalla to take these questions up
                            immediately after his return to Washington and that in the meantime no
                            publicity whatever should be given to the fact that any further
                            consideration is being given to these proposals in Washington. I have
                            likewise made very clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the basic
                            reasons underlying the decision reached by the Department. He is still
                            firmly of the opinion that from the standpoint of expediency it would be
                            easier for him to obtain a solution of the oil controversy by his
                            Government if such solution were not made a condition previous to the
                            reaching of an agreement on credits for exchange stabilization and on
                            related matters. He is a man of fine character and real intelligence and
                            I obtained the impression that while he is deeply chagrined by the reply
                            I have had to give him he will nevertheless do his best to go along with
                            us on the lines proposed.</p>
                        <p>He has shown me in confidence an official communication addressed to his
                            Government by the Japanese Minister in Lima offering a barter
                            arrangement for 3,000,000 tons [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of tin ore
                            and certain other minerals in return for various classifications of
                            Japanese manufactured goods. In his conversation with me on that subject
                            the Minister has made it clear that while it was the general intention
                            of his Government and especially of himself to try to find a
                            satisfactory basis for an agreement with the United States, in the
                            absence of such basis they would be “obliged” to make some such
                            arrangement with Japan as <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0330"/>that
                            proposed, or with any other government that might make similar
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>As I see the situation with Bolivia at this time it would appear to me to
                            be more urgent and critical than the impression in the Department. While
                            I am entirely willing to concede that the prerequisites indicated in the
                            Department’s telegram involve questions of basic principle which are
                            sound and desirable it would nevertheless seem to me that if Bolivia at
                            the present time were to involve herself in arrangements of the kind
                            proposed by Japan and recently by Germany it would inestimably [<hi rend="italic">inevitably</hi>] have a direct effect upon the
                            political trend in Bolivia. I trust that the Department will give
                            consideration to the possibility of finding some compromise which would
                            make it possible to avoid this danger.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that since his
                            arrival in La Paz, Dr. Luis Fernando Guachalla, Minister of Bolivia in
                            Washington has made no secret of the fact that he believes that an
                            equitable solution of the pending controversy between the Bolivian
                            Government and the Standard Oil Company is highly desirable from the
                            point of view of Bolivian credit. On account of his close acquaintance
                            with the whole subject and the reputation for disinterested integrity
                            which Dr. Guachalla enjoys to a very high degree, I have reason to
                            believe that Dr. Guachalla’s opinion on this subject has definitely
                            strengthened the position of those members of the Government who were
                            already personally favorable toward such a solution as Dr. Guachalla has
                            in mind.</p>
                        <p>In recent conversations of a personal and confidential character, Dr.
                            Guachalla told me that he had already discussed the whole subject in
                            some detail with President Busch, with Dr. Mendoza Lopez, Minister of
                            Finance and with Dr. Gabriel Gosálvez,<note n="24" xml:id="d337fn24">Minister for the Interior.</note> who is generally regarded as the
                            leading influence in the present Government. He found all three
                            gentlemen favorable in principle to the views which he had presented,
                            although Dr. Gosálvez indicated some doubts <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0331"/>whether the Bolivian Government would be in a position
                            at this time to take the initiative in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Gosálvez, however, suggested that Dr. Guachalla should prepare a
                            careful memorandum reviewing the whole subject and indicating possible
                            formulas for solution. This memorandum has now been completed and will
                            be discussed early next week by Dr. Guachalla and an influential group
                            of Government officials which will include President Busch, the Minister
                            of Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When this interview has
                            taken place Dr. Guachalla indicated that he would inform me as to the
                            results.</p>
                        <p>As to possible formulas Dr. Guachalla told me confidentially that he was
                            giving careful consideration to the following: <hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            compensation to the Company for the fair value of their property, as an
                            act of comity by the Bolivian Government without direct reference to the
                            fundamental juridical problem; <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) a direct
                            arrangement, probably to be effected by an exchange of identical
                            communications with the authorized representative of the Company in La
                            Paz, providing for the repeal or the modification of the fundamental
                            decree of March 13, 1937,<note n="25" xml:id="d337fn25">For translation,

                            the Company at an agreed price to be previously determined by direct
                            conversations; <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) or as an alternative to the two
                            solutions suggested above a decree by the Supreme Court favorable to the
                            Company preceded by a strictly confidential agreement on the part of the
                            Company to sell the property in question at a price previously
                            determined.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guachalla asked me my personal opinion on the three general formulas
                            outlined above. I felt I owed him an equally frank reply, and told him
                            that I did not believe that his first formula would be likely to satisfy
                            the legitimate desire of the Company to safeguard the fundamental
                            principles for which they had contended from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Similarly in my judgment the third formula was open to objection both
                            from the point of view of the Government and the Company, because it
                            seemed to me that it would be very difficult to prevent knowledge
                            leaking out sooner or later as to any previous understanding precedent
                            to a court decision. Such knowledge would destroy the moral value of the
                            decision itself and tend to compromise the dignity of both parties.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons I told Dr. Guachalla that the second of his three plans
                            seems to me to have the great advantages of frankness and rapidity. I
                            went on to say that if the correspondence to be made public were
                            friendly on both sides it seemed to me that a direct arrangement at this
                            time, if feasible, would create a favorable impression as to the
                            strength and the good faith of the Bolivian Government in dealing with
                            foreign investors.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0332"/>
                        <p>Although the whole conversation outlined above was obviously friendly and
                            personal and cannot be taken to bind either one of the parties in such
                            discussions as may be later undertaken I gained the impression that the
                            Bolivian Government was for the first time seriously considering a
                            direct solution of a problem which they find to be increasingly
                            embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, possible that the Government itself will be unwilling
                            to take the direct initiative which is suggested by Dr. Guachalla and
                            that it might prefer arbitration at the friendly request of the American
                            Government. If such a step should be contemplated it seems reasonably
                            clear that the request in question should preferably be a matter of
                            record before rather than after any Supreme Court decision by which the
                            Bolivian Government might feel itself to be juridically obligated. If
                            there should be any suggestion in this direction from Dr. Guachalla in
                            the conversation which I expect to have with him next week, it will, of
                            course, be reported very promptly to the Department.</p>

                        <p>5. Dr. Guachalla told me yesterday that he had definite reason to believe
                            that the Bolivian Government would accede to a direct arrangement with
                            Standard Oil Company similar to plan <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) mentioned
                            in my despatch 430 of January 25, but to be formulated in a single legal
                            instrument called “Transacción” in the Bolivian Civil Code. He was, of
                            course, uncertain what formula could be devised to safeguard the
                            principle in which the company is interested or as to the amount of
                            compensation. He felt, however, that his hands would be strengthened
                            here if he had some expression from the Department as to the general
                            plan and perhaps later than [<hi rend="italic">on?</hi>] at the
                            appropriate time some assistance in working out the necessary details
                            with the company.</p>

                            difficulties in working out details of formula suggested by <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0333"/>Guachalla, in my judgment only
                            practicable solution which would carry genuine moral value would be
                            friendly arbitration in the interests of both parties including all
                            points at issue, (1) legality of degree of March 13, 1937; (2) extensive
                            claims of Bolivia for unpaid taxes and for alleged violations of
                            contract, and, in the event of a favorable decision on point 1; (3)
                            compensation to the company for fair value of the property but
                            specifically excluding actual return of the property which is apparently
                            desired by neither party.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian Government would probably object to such a plan at the
                            outset but might be persuaded eventually as to its genuine fairness.</p>

                        <p>2. Your 5, February 2, 9 a.m. and 6, February 2, noon. Department’s
                            understanding is that the legality of the decree of March 13, 1937 is
                            the principal point at issue in the case now pending before the Bolivian
                            Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>If the decision should be in favor of the company the Department would,
                            of course, expect the Bolivian Government either to restore the
                            properties with reasonable compensation for damages suffered by the
                            company, or payment by the Government of the value of the properties at
                            the time of the taking in the event that it should decide to expropriate
                            them.</p>
                        <p>It would, of course, be desirable if a friendly compromise settlement of
                            all questions now at issue could be reached without awaiting a decision
                            by the Court. It is not clear from your telegrams whether the Government
                            is disposed to bring about such a settlement. If in your judgment it is
                            so disposed, you may in an appropriate manner indicate to the Government
                            that the Department would be glad to see such a settlement made. The
                            method suggested under (<hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>) of your despatch
                            no. 430 of January 25 would seem to afford a way out of the difficulty.
                            It might even be possible in such a settlement to avoid any discussion
                            of the validity of the decree of March 13, 1937. This, however, is a
                            matter for the consideration of the Bolivian Government and the company.
                            Our principal interest is in promoting a settlement in such a way as may
                            be both feasible and satisfactory. It might even be proper at some point
                            in your discussions with the Bolivian Government to say that if the
                            decision of the Court should be adverse to the company your Government
                            might be under the necessity of asking for arbitration, but that it is,
                            of course, desirous of avoiding such a situation if possible.</p>

                        <p>The Department considers that fair compensation to the company will
                            adequately protect its interests from any adverse effects of the decree
                            in other countries where it has properties.</p>

                        <p>9. Morning newspapers announce briefly that the Supreme Court decided
                            unanimously yesterday “to declare the demands initiated by Standard Oil
                            against the Government irregular and inadmissible on account of lack of
                            juridical competence on the part of its representatives.”</p>
                        <p>Subject to more complete information later, my immediate impression,
                            shared by local representative of the company, is that this decision is
                            intended to leave all fundamental questions wide open for possible
                            settlement by negotiation or arbitration.</p>

                        <p>11. Guachalla told me last night that in his judgment, in view of recent
                            indeterminate Supreme Court decision, an informal request for
                            arbitration at this time would be received in a very friendly spirit. He
                            suggests exclusion of actual return of the property on the ground that
                            this is desired by neither party and would arouse hostile reactions
                            here. He also suggests that details other than general principle of
                            arbitration be reserved for discussion after his arrival in Washington
                            April 5.</p>

                            believe that what apparently is contemplated at this time is some direct
                            settlement rather than arbitration in the legal sense. Please clarify

                            been instructed “to seek a direct understanding with the company under

                            adjustment and that he would confer in detail with Mr. Welles when the

                            ripe plum dangled before a hungry person than Latin America appears to
                            be to these lawless nations, hungry as wolves for vast territory with
                            rich undeveloped natural resources such as South America possesses; that
                            it is all-important for the American nations to pursue a lawful,
                            friendly and reasonable course with each other; and that the dollars and
                            cents involved in the oil seizure were small compared to the great
                            injury that would result to Bolivia, as well as to my own and other
                            countries, if that sort of an act should go uncorrected and the
                            friendship between the two countries should be seriously impaired. He
                            agreed heartily and said he was going to take the matter up in all
                            earnestness looking towards some method of adjustment.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister called at Mr. Duggan’s request to discuss the case
                            of the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan explained to the Minister that he wished to explore possible
                            procedure for a friendly and mutually satisfactory settlement of this
                            case. He explained that the Department’s policy in such cases is to use
                            its good offices to bring the two parties together and to facilitate in
                            every appropriate way direct negotiations and agreement between the
                            parties. He pointed out that it is impossible for the Department to act
                            as mediator or go-between in the many problems which confront American
                            business throughout the world, not only because the Department lacks
                            complete information and data in the cases, but also because it has not
                            the personnel necessary for this work. Mr. Duggan then inquired what the
                            Minister’s specific instructions are and if the Minister would be able
                            to transmit to his Government a proposal which might be made by the
                            company and submitted to the Minister by the Department.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guachalla said that he has rather strict instructions and is only
                            authorized to transmit to his Government the suggestions of the
                            Department. Mr. Duggan then inquired if these instructions would be <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0337"/>satisfied if the Department
                            were to submit a company proposal to him with the comment that the
                            Bolivian Government might wish to examine it as a possible basis for
                            settlement. The Minister replied that the Government knows the company’s
                            views, that it takes the attitude that it has nothing further to discuss
                            with the company, and that therefore what the Bolivian Government wants
                            is the Department’s suggestions or at least the Department’s analysis of
                            and comment upon any proposal that might be made by the company. The
                            Minister pointed out that since the decision of the Bolivian Supreme
                            Court, it will be very difficult for the Bolivian Government to
                            reconsider the juridical aspects of the case, or to enter into direct
                            negotiations with the company. He repeated the opinion, however, that if
                            the Department could submit some formula or suggested plan, he believed
                            that something might grow out of it. The Minister recalled that while he
                            was in La Paz Mr. Caldwell had received a telegram from the Department
                            expressing approval of an out-of-court settlement which would leave to
                            one side the question of the validity of the decree of March 13, 1937.
                            He stated that the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had rejected a
                            proposed settlement along these lines and that he understood the company
                            to have declared that it would prefer an adverse decision by the
                            Bolivian Supreme Court so that the Department would ask for
                            international arbitration. The Minister commented upon the fact that the
                            Department had not made this request. He added that the Bolivian
                            Government could not accept international arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan then asked if the Department took the first step in
                            transmitting a proposal which the company might make, together with the
                            Department’s comment thereon, the Minister would be able to transmit the
                            proposal to his Government. He also inquired if after such a first step
                            the Bolivian Government might be disposed to designate the Minister or
                            some other representative to meet with a representative of the company
                            to carry on the discussions. The idea would be to have the company
                            designate a representative who was not an employee of the company and
                            who had had nothing to do with the case. The Minister asked if Mr.
                            Duggan had in mind an arrangement similar to the Mexican one<note n="30" xml:id="d346fn30">See <ref target="#pg_667">pp. 667</ref> ff.</note>
                            and Mr. Duggan replied in the affirmative. Dr. Guachalla stated that he
                            thought such a procedure might be possible, but he emphasized that in
                            order to make action possible and easy for the Bolivian Government the
                            latter feels that it must deal with the Department instead of with the
                            company, at least at the beginning.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guachalla added that after a preliminary exchange between his
                            Government and the Department, he would be willing to discuss the matter
                            informally and unofficially with representatives of the company, but
                            with the specific understanding that no publicity would be <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0338"/>given to such discussions and that they
                            would not be regarded as committing either his Government or himself to
                            any action whatever. The Minister repeated that he is always at the
                            Department’s disposal to discuss the case and to explore the possibility
                            of agreeing upon a formula. He indicated that such a formula would
                            include compensation to the company, reciprocal release of all claims
                            and counterclaims, and the exclusion of all juridical phases of the
                            case. The Minister promised to send Mr. Duggan a copy of the proposal
                            that was under discussion in La Paz when the Minister returned there
                            after the Lima Conference. Mr. Duggan promised to go over this proposal
                            and to get in touch with the Minister within the next few days for a
                            further discussion.</p>
                        <p>A possible procedure might be to redraft the proposed agreement dated May
                            26, 1939,<note n="31" xml:id="d346fn31">Not printed.</note> which is the
                            subject of Mr. Hackworth’s<note n="32" xml:id="d346fn32">Legal
                                Adviser.</note> memorandum of the same date, in the light of the
                            material which the Bolivian Minister is to furnish. The situation then
                            could be explained to representatives of the company, and the Department
                            might formally submit to the Bolivian Minister a proposal which he could
                            transmit to his Government. In submitting this proposal it probably
                            would be necessary for the Department to state that it had carefully
                            examined the terms of the proposal and that they appeared to offer the
                            basis for a possible satisfactory settlement of the case.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister called to see me this afternoon at my request.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that no one could recognize and appreciate more fully
                            than I the repeated and effective efforts he had made during the past
                            year to find a fair and satisfactory solution of the difficulties which
                            had arisen by reason of the cancellation by the Bolivian Government of
                            the concessions of the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia. I told the
                            Minister that I regretted deeply the fact that because of circumstances
                            entirely beyond his control no basis for agreement had as yet been
                            found, and that I feared that if no agreement were reached in the
                            reasonably near future a very unfortunate situation would be created
                            here in this country which inevitably would be prejudicial to the very
                            friendly relations between the two countries which had existed over a
                            period of so many years. I reminded him of the conversation which we had
                            had in this regard a year ago and of our <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0339"/>agreement at that time that every effort should be made
                            to avert the creation of a strong prejudice on the part of public
                            opinion in this country against Bolivia because of the apparent
                            willingness of the Bolivian Government to take over properties
                            legitimately belonging to American nationals without undertaking to make
                            full and equitable compensation therefor. I said that we had both agreed
                            that a situation of this kind would undermine confidence in the United
                            States with regard to Bolivia and would prevent American cooperation and
                            investment in the development of Bolivian natural resources, in which
                            the Bolivian Government was so greatly interested.</p>
                        <p>I said it seemed to me that the time had now come when a further and a
                            concerted effort should be made to find a basis for an agreement which
                            would settle this controversy in a manner satisfactory to both sides to
                            the dispute. I told the Minister that with this object in mind various
                            conversations had been held, as he knew, in the Department of State with
                            a view to furthering a solution. I said that I was now prepared to hand
                            him, not officially as on behalf of this Government but unofficially as
                            an evidence of the friendly interest which this Government had in paving
                            the way for a solution, the draft of a suggested agreement which I
                            earnestly hoped would provide the basis for the conclusion of a
                            satisfactory negotiation between the company and his Government. Before
                            doing this, however, I said to the Minister that I wanted to ask him a
                            frank question, and that was whether in his opinion this was a
                            propitious moment for these suggestions to be conveyed to the Government
                            of Bolivia. I did not wish, I said, to take this step at this time if
                            the Minister felt that no concrete results would be derived
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <p>The Minister immediately replied that he thought the moment was in fact
                            highly propitious. He said that, in the first place, since there was no
                            Congress now in existence in Bolivia, the Bolivian Executive would
                            determine a question of this kind without having to obtain the consent
                            of the leaders of the various parties, which consent for political
                            reasons might not be forthcoming. The Minister also said that another
                            very favorable development was the fact that the new Foreign Minister,
                            Señor Ostria Gutierrez, was an intimate friend of his and a man in whose
                            integrity and energy he had entire confidence. He said that by chance
                            only a day or so ago he had received a letter from the new Minister just
                            before he left his present post for La Paz, in which he requested the
                            Minister here to give him a full account of all pending matters between
                            this Government and that of Bolivia “beginning first of all with the
                            Standard Oil matter.” The Minister assured me that the new Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs shared his own point of view completely and that I could
                            be certain that anything that he, the Minister, recommended would be
                            supported with energy and ability by his Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</p>
                        <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0340"/>
                        <p>I thereupon handed the suggested basis for agreement<note n="33" xml:id="d347fn33">
                        <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> to the
                            Minister, who told me that he would immediately study it carefully and
                            give me any suggestions that occurred to him before sending it on to his
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister said that the new Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs would not arrive in La Paz until about July 1, and
                            that consequently this would give him time to send a long and detailed
                            recommendation, to be transmitted in draft.</p>

                        <p>During the course of a conversation regarding other matters, the Minister
                            handed me the attached memorandum<note n="35" xml:id="d349fn35">
                        <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> regarding the formula presented
                            to him for study for a settlement of the differences between the
                            Standard Oil Company of Bolivia and the Bolivian Government.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he appreciated that the Department had presented
                            the formula using as far as possible the drafted agreement which had
                            been drawn up in Bolivia in February of this year. Since then has
                            occurred the decision of the Supreme Court which, therefore, would
                            require on the part of his government a somewhat different approach. On
                            the basis of what he knows of his government’s position, he thought that
                            the only formula that would hold promise of acceptance had to be one
                            which was based upon determination by a board of the amounts due, not
                            only by his government to the company, but by the company to the
                            government. He recognized that this would be extremely difficult for the
                            company to accept, but stated his very firm conviction that his
                            government would never agree to any formula that contained in it a
                            statement that the government owed the company an amount for
                            compensation for the company’s properties. The Supreme Court decision of
                            March 15 now made it impossible for the government to admit that it
                            possessed any legal obligation to pay compensation to the company. He
                            felt that his government would be willing in a public document to
                            recognize that in equity the company should receive a payment, but he
                            insisted that his government would <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0343"/>require that the document recognize that it had certain
                            claims against the company and that the board should determine the
                            amounts due the government under these claims.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he had no suggestions for redrafting, although
                            he would suggest a change in the preamble in order to bring in the
                            thought of mutual payments in equity, the omission of paragraphs two and
                            three, the redrafting of paragraph four to give authority to the board
                            to make an examination of the government’s claims against the company in
                            order to determine the amount due, and a redraft of the last paragraph
                            to put it on a bilateral basis, that is, to make it apply to payments
                            from the company to the government as well as from the government to the
                            company.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he would not be back in town until Monday, July
                            3, and that he would telephone me on that day merely to inquire whether
                            the Department wished to consult further with him. He stated that he had
                            not yet transmitted to his government the draft handed him by Mr.
                            Welles, and that he did not intend even to inform his government that he
                            was carrying on exploratory discussions until these discussions had
                            advanced somewhat further.</p>

                                    transaction like that suggested to the Company without success
                                    last February. Hence it follows that the Government of Bolivia
                                    cannot disassociate itself from the bases which the decision of
                                    last March 8 and its supplement of the 15th of the same month
                                    enunciate. It is not the desire of the Bolivian executive power
                                    to depreciate the judgment of the Supreme Court.</p>

                        <p>III. This decision, the legal resolution of March 15 says, brings
                                    about a situation which means a judgment not subject to review;
                                    this is, a juridic situation which cannot be amended by other
                                    tribunals of the Republic nor by the decision of another power
                                    of the State, through a new process or legal proceeding.</p>
                                <p>The lawsuit being closed in this way, it should be noted that a
                                    decision has not been pronounced on the basis of the action
                                    commenced by the company since it was contrary to the law of
                                    litigations in view of the lack of legal personality of its
                                    representatives. This situation permits the study of some
                                    formula of convention which does not imply review, even
                                    indirect, of the suit nor of its consequences: the definitive
                                    possession of the concessions by the State.</p>
                            <p>IV. It should be borne in mind that the case of the Standard Oil
                                Company in Bolivia is penal and not one of expropriation, a basic
                                factor which prevents the acknowledgment of a payment which
                                signifies indemnification. However, a formula in equity may solve
                                the divergency, provided that it, as its essence indicates,
                                contemplates the position of both Parties or their mutual
                                complaints. Thus it is equitable to speak of a payment in favor of
                                the Company if there is later given occasion to appraise the amount
                                of the countercharge alleged by the Government before the Supreme
                                Court.</p>
                            <p>V. The prior considerations pointed out above should, without doubt,
                                suggest several modifications to the proposal. In summary, they
                                would include: <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>the definitive ownership of the concessions by the State
                                        results from a definite legal sentence; it cannot be
                                        inferred from an acquiescence of the Company;</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>the agreement is based on an idea of equity; then, if the
                                        Government of Bolivia consents to recognize a payment in
                                        favor of the Company, in return it is necessary and just
                                        that the Company agrees to recoguize in favor of the
                                        Government, another payment, both in principal, which would
                                        have as a basis the idea of reparation for damages and
                                        injuries;</item>

                                        its object to establish on whom it is incumbent to pay the
                                        balance owed which results from this double
                                        valuation;</item>

                                        judgment arrangement and its lack of connection with legal
                                        aspects, it appears more appropriate to avoid references to
                                        “recognition” of an obligation to compensation. Perhaps it
                                        would be preferable to begin the formula with the
                                        organization of the commission of experts before which the
                                        two Parties agree to present their claims of a pecuniary
                                        nature, accepting, in advance, the decision which it
                                        gives.</item>

                        <p>The Minister<note n="37" xml:id="d351fn37">i. e., the Bolivian
                                Minister.</note> informed me that the latest information he had was
                            to the effect that Señor and Señora Foianini would pass through
                            Washington en route to New York Thursday at 4 a.m. by plane. The
                            Minister said that he did not know when they would return from New York
                            and that he did not have any further information with respect to their
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that since his conversation with me on June 26 in
                            which he commented on the proposed agreement for the settlement of the
                            Standard Oil controversy the Department had been studying continuously
                            and carefully a revision of the agreement that would take into account
                            his views. There had been several new drafts prepared and discussed with
                            representatives of the Standard Oil Company. In the beginning the
                            company was most reluctant to consider the inclusion in the agreement of
                            a provision authorizing the tribunal to pass upon the question of the
                            amount of taxes due the Government from the company over and above those
                            that had already been paid. By dint of insistent effort the company had
                            finally been persuaded to accept a formula that would submit to the
                            tribunal this question.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon handed to the Minister a copy of a new draft<note n="38" xml:id="d351fn38">The enclosure, <ref target="#pg_338">p.
                                338</ref>.</note> providing for the submission to a tribunal of
                            three persons two questions—(1) the value in United States dollars of
                            the property of the company in Bolivia on March 12, 1937, and (2) the
                            amount of taxes, if any, over and above those paid by the company, due
                            the Government from the company. I told the Minister that I knew he was
                            as desirous of a prompt settlement of this controversy as was the
                            Department. The company’s agreement had only been obtained after long
                            discussions and after the submission and counter-submission of many
                            drafts. I urged therefore that the Bolivian Government give the most
                            careful consideration to the new draft, suggesting only such changes as
                            seemed <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0346"/>absolutely necessary to
                            meet the Bolivian point of view. In particular I urged that no changes
                            in language, unless absolutely essential, be suggested with regard to
                            paragraph 2 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), since the language relating to
                            that section had been worked out only after a great deal of effort. I
                            said that I considered the company’s acquiescence so precarious that any
                            material change in the language might result in the company’s
                            reconsidering its whole position.</p>
                        <p>The Minister assured me that he would study the new draft first of all to
                            determine whether the Government could agree to it in principle. If he
                            thought that it could he would keep to a minimum any suggestion to his
                            Government for modifications of language. He again expressed his belief
                            that the Minister of Mines would not be coming to the United States
                            unless he had decided to come to some agreement on this problem. He
                            hoped a settlement along the lines under discussion would meet with the
                            Minister’s favor, but of course he would not know until he had discussed
                            the proposal with the Minister, who so far was not informed as to the
                            informal discussions that had taken place in Washington. Dr. Guachalla
                            reminded me that he had not wished to bring anything to the Minister’s
                            attention until it was in a form which he himself could support and
                            recommend.</p>
                        <p>The Minister told me that he was returning to Washington on Thursday and
                            that he would probably come in to discuss the new draft.</p>

                                Minister.</note> then referred to the draft of agreement concerning
                            the Standard Oil controversy<note n="41" xml:id="d352fn41">
                        <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> which I had handed him last
                            Monday. Dr. Guachalla stated that he had studied it carefully in the
                            light of his instructions and that he considered that the draft in
                            general was in conformity with principles which his Government might
                            accept. The Minister stated, however, that there were two important
                            modifications which he would have to have introduced into the draft
                            before recommending it to his Government. The Minister thereupon
                            presented me with the attached informal memorandum of four points, of
                            which only two are important.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point in the memorandum, I made no comment
                            other than to state that of course it would be immediately studied. The
                            Minister here brings up the problem which has been so troublesome in
                            connection with Mexico, namely, that of sub-soil rights.</p>
                        <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>With regard to the third point in the memorandum, the Minister informed
                            me that the “demanda reconvencional” of 1937 listed five or six
                            complaints of the Government against the company all of which, if
                            proved, would result in the company owing the Government additional sums
                            of money. The question of taxes “patentes” was only one of these
                            complaints. The Minister explained that in Spanish the word “patentes”
                            had a very specific connotation covering, in law, only surface taxes. If
                            the intention in the draft was to indicate all taxes that might be due,
                            the word to be used should be “impuestos.” I informed the Minister that
                            the intention of the Department was to include all sums that might be
                            due by the company to the Government on account of the Government’s
                            complaints.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that an endeavor would be made to straighten out the
                            points that he had brought up.</p>

                            in Panama between the Foreign Minister and Mr. Welles.<note n="42" xml:id="d353fn42">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary of State, was

                        <p>The Minister then referred to the controversy with the Standard Oil
                            Company. He thanked me for the résumé sent him of a recent letter from
                            the Standard Oil Company commenting upon the Minister’s observations.
                            Dr. Guachalla stated that he was of the opinion that his Government,
                            while possibly willing to submit to the Arbitral Board the question as
                            to whether the subsoil resources should be taken into account in
                            calculating the value of the company’s interests, would not accept the
                            words “property rights and interests” in the present draft. From the
                            Government’s point of view, the acceptance of this language would imply
                            an admission of the validity of the concession contract, which of course
                            the Government was not prepared to do, particularly in view of the
                            recent Supreme Court decision. Nevertheless the Minister stated that
                            there was a principle of Bolivian law called <hi rend="italic">lucro
                                cesante</hi> embodied in both the Civil and the Commercial Codes,
                            which acknowledges that prospective profits be taken into account in
                            calculating damages and compensation. In view of this accepted principle
                            of Bolivian law, the Minister thought that it should be possible to find
                            language more acceptable to his Government <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0350"/>to replace the words “property rights and interests”. I
                            told the Minister I was very interested in the principle of Bolivian law
                            he mentioned and would appreciate his submitting any redrafts which he
                            thought would be acceptable to his Government. The Minister said he
                            would try his hand and hoped to send the new language on this point
                            within the next few days.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he had decided not to submit his formal report
                            to his Government on the present status of the controversy until there
                            had been further exploration on the point he had elaborated. He will,
                            however, send a personal letter to the Foreign Minister outlining the
                            situation as he sees it, and indicating that a formal report will be
                            sent within the near future.</p>

                        <p>The Bolivian Minister called to discuss informally the formula for
                            solving the Standard Oil controversy. He reiterated his belief that his
                            Government would never accept the phrase in the draft proposal
                            “company’s property rights and interests”. He thought the phrase would
                            be like waving a red flag before a bull.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had been giving a great deal of thought to a re-draft of
                            the language and had two suggestions to offer: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>He thought that it would be much more satisfactory to his
                                    Government if the language read “the company’s properties and
                                    interests”. It was the reference to property rights which he
                                    thought would be particularly distasteful to his Government. He
                                    thought that his Government might agree to the language
                                    suggested since it would not open up the question of the
                                    company’s rights, the existence of which the Government would be
                                    compelled to deny.</item>

                                <item>The Minister reminded me that the Company in its <hi rend="italic">demanda</hi>

                                    against the Government had included a second section in which it
                                    requested compensation for its properties and set forth in
                                    detail the value of its properties. In its reply to this <hi rend="italic">demanda</hi>, the Government had listed its
                                    pecuniary claims against the Company on account of taxes and for
                                    other reasons. The Minister wondered whether it might not be
                                    possible to re-draft the proposal so as to give the arbitral
                                    board the duty of determining the amounts due by the Government
                                    to the Company and by the Company to the Government on the basis
                                    of the claims made in the Company’s <hi rend="italic">demanda</hi> and in the Government’s <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0351"/>reply. He thought that language
                                    might be evolved which could omit any reference to the
                                    “company’s property rights and interests” by merely referring to
                                    the Company’s claim as set forth in the <hi rend="italic">demanda</hi>.</item>
                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>I said to the Minister that this was a very interesting suggestion, that
                            I did not remember with sufficient precision those sections of the <hi rend="italic">demanda</hi> and the reply to give him even an offhand
                            indication, but that I would look into the matter at once.</p>
                        <p>I agreed to make a re-draft of the section in question, if the Minister’s
                            suggestion seemed feasible and to get in touch with him as soon as this
                            draft was ready. The Minister said that he would likewise prepare
                            specific language and would be available at any time.</p>

                                            March 13, 1937, within twelve months from the date of

                                            currency or its equivalent in sound free exchange
                                            currency. The Company agrees that it will pay with
                                            interest to the Government, in Bolivianos within twelve
                                            months any such taxes as may be found due under 2 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), with interest at the same

                                            Thereafter no issue will remain pending between them and
                                            there will be no occasion, on the one or the other part,
                                            for any subsequent claims or counter-claims of

                                            shall be regarded as having terminated satisfactorily

                            my attention to your letter addressed to him on November 29, 1939<note n="46" xml:id="d356fn46">Not printed.</note> concerning the case of
                            the Standard Oil Company of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a draft of a proposed agreement<note n="47" xml:id="d356fn47">
                        <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> between the Standard Oil
                            Company of Bolivia and the Bolivian Government to settle the differences
                            arising out of the decree of March 13, 1937 canceling the Company’s
                            concession contract. In a conference on December 8 last with the
                            Bolivian Minister he was informed concerning this draft, Articles 2 and
                            3 of which were read to him. The phraseology of subdivision (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of Article 2 would seem to meet the objections
                            mentioned in the first two paragraphs of your letter. While the Bolivian
                            Minister seemed to find no objection to the phraseology of subdivision
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), he expressed the opinion that, in order
                            to meet the desires of his Government, it would be necessary to include
                            in the agreement a provision under which the Commission would be
                            required to consider a counter-claim of the Government against the
                            Company, not only for the taxes referred to in subdivision (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), but also for damages on account of the
                            alleged non-performance by the Company of its contract obligations. He
                            also expressed the view that the agreement should contain in this
                            connection a reference to certain charges made by the Bolivian
                            Government against the Company in answering the suit of the latter to
                            have the cancellation decree annulled, that is, the charges relating to
                            the alleged violations by the Company of the concession contract.</p>
                        <p>Whatever views may be entertained concerning the validity of the charges
                            brought by the Bolivian Government against the Company, it is difficult
                            to see how it would be possible to deny the request of the Government to
                            include in the proposed agreement provisions under which the Commission
                            would be required to consider the Government’s claims. Consideration
                            will therefore be given to the question of including in subdivision (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of Article 2 of the draft agreement the words
                            “and damages” immediately following the word “taxes” in the first line,
                            and adding at the end of Article 3 a paragraph reading somewhat as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In determining the question under section 2 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the Commission will take into account, in addition
                                    to the Government’s claims of <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0355"/>unpaid taxes, the Government’s claims against
                                    the company due to nonfulfillment of its contract, as set forth
                                    in the Government’s counter-suit before the Supreme Court of
                                    Bolivia.”</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>Before discussing this matter further with the Bolivian Minister, the
                            Department would like to be informed whether the Company would agree to
                            the draft agreement of November 29, 1939 with the additions suggested
                            above.</p>

                        <p>A. (1) Consideration of the manner in which the Government of the
                                    United States may be able to cooperate with the Brazilian
                                    Government in such manner as the latter may desire in connection
                                    with the Brazilian program of national defense. These
                                    discussions may cover points already raised by the Brazilian
                                    Government and such other points as the Brazilian Government may
                                    desire to propose.</p>

                                    the Brazilian balance of payments position. Proposed methods of
                                    financing purchases of foreign materials. It is understood that
                                    the contemplated methods are those which would have the smallest
                                    immediate impact on the external position of the milreis.
                                    Specific action which this Government might take to facilitate
                                    the development of this program.</p>
                        <p>In order for this Government to have a complete understanding of these
                            problems, the balance of payments position for 1939 and ensuing years
                            should be thoroughly discussed as well as the anticipated effects of the
                            proposed measures on future years.</p>
                        <p>This Government understands that in order to carry out the various
                            aspects of a comprehensive program, large amounts of money will have to
                            be contributed locally. For example, a long-range development program
                            will doubtless require large expenditures for local materials and labor.
                            It would be desirable to have information as to the methods proposed by
                            the Brazilian Government to finance both the external and internal
                            portions of the program because of their joint effect on the budgetary
                            and governmental indebtedness position of the Brazilian Government.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Minister that this Government is looking forward with
                            the greatest satisfaction to the opportunity which his visit will afford
                            for the discussion of all problems in which the two Governments have a
                            common interest. If there are any further points beyond those above
                            indicated, and which in Aranha’s opinion could be usefully taken up
                            during the time of his visit, please obtain such additional suggestions
                            from him and telegraph me accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Discussions with Senhor Aranha have resolved the matter of economic
                            cooperation between the United States and Brazil into three principal
                            categories: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The provision of credits to enable Brazil to clear up exchange

                                    seasonal fluctuations in the milreis exchange. Belated to this
                                    is the whole question of the creation of a central bank.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>

                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>The first and the financial aspects of the third are questions which seem
                            to fall naturally within the province of the Export-Import Bank and
                            considerable preliminary discussion has already taken place with Mr.
                            Jesse Jones.<note n="10" xml:id="d360fn10">Chairman of the Board of

                            additional progress can be made, however, pending the resolution by
                            Congress of the matter of the extension of the charter of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>The second topic, on the other hand, falls clearly within the scope of
                            the Treasury, and in this field discussions could profitably be resumed
                            at once. I believe that it might be appropriate to suggest this course
                            of action to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

                            Government presents through Your Excellency, to your Government, its
                            thanks for the courtesies which were extended to me and to my companions
                            during my visit to your country.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency may be assured that my grateful recollection of the
                            period during which I had the honor of being my country’s Ambassador to
                            the United States, and that the amity of my people towards the American
                            people and the mutual confidence that exists between our two
                            Governments, have been enhanced by the repercussion of the new and
                            expressive demonstrations of cooperation and of friendship towards
                            Brazil which we have witnessed during the course of this visit.</p>
                        <p>With a desire to foster continued mutually beneficial economic relations
                            between Brazil and the United States and to develop the national economy
                            and natural resources of Brazil, the Government of Brazil, after due
                            deliberation and the considered discussion of its authorized
                            representatives with the authorized representatives of the Government of
                            the United States of America, is undertaking or intends to undertake in
                            the near future the following policies and actions to attain the
                            objectives mentioned:</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>It is the decision of the Government of Brazil to issue a decree-law
                            freeing the exchange market for commercial transactions. This will
                            ensure the provision of funds in payments for imports from the United
                            States in accordance with the note of the Brazilian Ambassador to the
                            Secretary of State of the United States of February 2, 1935.<note n="12" xml:id="d361fn12">Executive Agreement Series No. 82, <ref target="#pg_34">p. 34</ref>, or 49 Stat. 3808.</note> This
                            measure will also facilitate the transfer of an equitable return upon
                            investments made in Brazil by United States citizens under normal
                            conditions in the Brazilian balance of international payments. The
                            Brazilian Government will give further study to this matter. I believe
                            that, as a result of the discussions between the authorized
                            representatives of our respective governments during the course of my
                            visit, a substantial accord has been reached as to the basis of these
                            provisions and for the necessary cooperation between our
                            institutions.</p>
                        <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0361"/>
                        <p>In order to proceed with this proposed facilitation of exchange
                            transactions, the Government of Brazil finds it necessary to provide
                            dollar exchange to meet amounts now due American exporters. To make this
                            provision, my Government has addressed a communication to the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington with a view to obtaining the extension
                            of appropriate acceptance credits for this purpose by that organization.
                            A copy of this communication is enclosed as Appendix A.<note n="13" xml:id="d361fn13">Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press

                  </p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>The Government of Brazil has decided to create a Central Reserve Bank
                            which will have the functions of regulating the internal and external
                            value of the milreis, and of controlling credit and the money market.
                            The Central Reserve Bank will endeavor to eliminate unusual fluctuations
                            in the balance of international payments and those arising from the
                            irregular timing of in- and out-payments by a policy of adapting the
                            balance of payments to normal exchange resources. To this end a line of
                            credit in American currency, intended exclusively for this purpose,
                            would be desirable in order to ensure relative stability in the value of
                            the milreis within the policy described. A copy of a communication
                            addressed by my Government to the Treasury Department regarding this
                            matter is enclosed as Appendix B.<note n="14" xml:id="d361fn14">

                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>With particular view to the systematic economic development of the
                            Brazilian nation, my Government, in its communication to the
                            Export-Import Bank of Washington, a copy of which is enclosed as
                            Appendix A, took up the question of obtaining longer term credits to
                            finance Brazilian purchases of industrial goods in the United States,
                            and the terms of repayment of such credits. These credits are believed
                            to be necessary to the proper utilization within a reasonable period of
                            the known resources of Brazil, for the benefit of the Brazilian people
                            and the further stimulation of Brazilian-American trade.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV</p>
                        <p>The Government of Brazil is especially desirous of stimulating the
                            systematic large-scale production of agricultural products native to
                            Brazil or capable of successful introduction to Brazil which will
                            complement production and find a market in the United States. The
                            Government of Brazil will, of course, appreciate the cooperation of the
                            Government of the United States in the study and development of such
                            products which may provide the United States with assured sources of
                            supply.</p>
                        <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0362"/>
                        <p rend="center">V</p>
                        <p>In connection with all of the phases of economic relationships between
                            the United States and Brazil, my Government has given renewed thought to
                            the dollar bond indebtedness of the Government of Brazil and of the
                            Brazilian States and Municipalities. The decision has been reached, as
                            part of its general economic program, to resume payment on July 1, 1939
                            on account of interest and amortization on these external dollar debts.
                            A transitional arrangement for a brief period to effect this has been
                            discussed with the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Incorporated.
                            These discussions in regard to the scale and amount of payment will be
                            continued after my return to Rio de Janeiro and subsequent announcement
                            will be made by my Government. It is the hope and expectation of my
                            Government that with the improvement in its foreign commerce which it
                            now foresees a permanent settlement which will be equitable and
                            satisfactory to all interests involved will follow upon the expiration
                            of this temporary arrangement.</p>

                        <p>Still with the desire of giving to the friendship between our two
                            countries economic and juridical bases commensurate with the purpose of
                            promoting cooperation between our two peoples, I wish to emphasize that
                            my Government intends to observe a general policy which will inspire the
                            confidence of United States investors giving them no more restrictions
                            than those to which Brazilian investors may be subjected. I can assure
                            Your Excellency that my Government has decided to encourage in any way
                            and means the valuable and desirable cooperation of United States

                            discussion of its authorized representatives with the authorized
                            representatives of the Government of the United States, is undertaking
                            or intends to undertake in the near future in order to foster continued
                            mutually beneficial economic relations between the United States and
                            Brazil and to develop the national economy and national resources of
                            Brazil. As you well know, my Government is keenly desirous of taking any
                            steps possible in order to continue and expand the economic cooperation
                            between Brazil and the United States.</p>
                        <p>My Government is pleased to note that it is the intention of the
                            Government of Brazil to establish and maintain a free exchange market
                            for commercial transactions and to facilitate the transfer of an
                            equitable return upon investments made in Brazil by United States
                            citizens under normal conditions in the Brazilian balance of
                            international payments. I am informed that the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington has found it possible to assist in the facilitation of
                            exchange transactions by extending appropriate acceptance credits in
                            order to provide dollar exchange to meet amounts due American exporters
                            for imports from the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am also informed that the Treasury Department finds itself heartily in
                            sympathy with the objectives stated in your communication to it
                            regarding the establishment of a Central Reserve Bank, and will be glad
                            to assist your Government in the establishment of such a bank and in its
                            operations, by placing at your disposal its advisory facilities and by
                            the extension of a line of credit. In the latter connection, I
                            understand that the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the
                            President, is informing you that the President is prepared to make a
                            recommendation to the Congress for suitable authorization.</p>
                        <p>I am further informed that the Export-Import Bank, with a view to
                            cooperating in the facilitation of trade between the United States and
                            Brazil and in the development of Brazilian natural resources, has agreed
                            to consider the arrangement of suitable longer term credits <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0364"/>to finance Brazilian purchases of
                            economic equipment in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Copies of communications in regard to these matters addressed to you by
                            the Secretary of the Treasury and by the President of the Export-Import
                            Bank are enclosed as Appendices A and B.<note n="15" xml:id="d362fn15">Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press Releases</hi>, March

                  </p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is interested in cooperating with the
                            Government of Brazil in every practicable way in the study and
                            development of agricultural products and production which will
                            complement production in the United States. In this regard, as you are
                            aware, legislation<note n="16" xml:id="d362fn16">Approved May 25, 1938;
                                52 Stat. 442.</note> has already been enacted which authorizes the
                            loan of experts of the Government of the United States to assist the
                            Government of Brazil in specialized agricultural studies and
                            developments. Plans have also been formulated for surveys of
                            agricultural possibilities, including the development of tropical
                            hardwoods, rubber, and other products, which surveys could readily
                            include the coincidental study of many additional native products of
                            Brazil. Draft legislation which would provide authorization for these
                            surveys is now before the Congress.</p>
                        <p>In relation to this general program of economic cooperation between the
                            United States and Brazil, I welcome the information that your Government
                            plans to resume payment on July 1, 1939, on account of interest and
                            amortization of the external dollar debt of the Government of Brazil and
                            of the Brazilian States and Municipalities, in accordance with a
                            transitional arrangement, and that it is the hope and expectation of
                            your Government that with the improvement in its foreign commerce which
                            it now foresees a permanent settlement which will be equitable and
                            satisfactory to all interests involved will follow upon the expiration
                            of this temporary arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I likewise welcome with sincere gratification the assurance that it is
                            the intention of the Government of Brazil to observe a general policy
                            which will encourage the participation of citizens of the United States
                            in the economic life of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>In reiterating to Your Excellency the assurances of my most distinguished
                            consideration, allow me to add my sincere thanks to you and to the
                            officials of the Brazilian Government accompanying you for the close and
                            valuable cooperation invariably accorded throughout the period of our
                            important negotiations, and to wish you all a safe and pleasant journey
                            in returning to Brazil.</p>

                            the time that Aranha signed paragraph V contained in his note to

                            carry out his undertaking. Upon his return here he was bitterly attacked
                            especially by the army and even in the Cabinet for having made the
                            promise (he had a near breakdown and had to go away for a month to
                            recuperate) it is only recently that President Vargas has agreed that
                            something should be done about it. In the meantime Aranha has hammered
                            away consistently in an endeavor to have some sort of payments resumed
                            on July 1. At the same time the Minister of Finance<note n="20" xml:id="d364fn20">Arthur de Souza Costa.</note> has been referred
                            insistently to prevailing unsatisfactory business conditions; to the
                            state of the budget; and to the lack of available foreign exchange for
                            making debt payments (obviously any large debt payments would have
                            immediate effect on our present exchange arrangements).</p>
                        <p>As I have frequently reported Aranha has never failed to tell me that
                            payments would be resumed in some form on July 1 but the President has
                            not yet decided what sort of payments he feels able to make. Aranha said
                            yesterday that the President was now contemplating <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0366"/>making payments on July 1 on arrears

                        <p>194. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told me last night that the
                            Minister of Finance, who has always opposed resumption of payments on
                            the foreign debt, came to see him yesterday afternoon and said that
                            President Vargas had ordered him to call on Dr. Aranha and accept
                            whatever plan Aranha proposed for resuming debt payments on July 1
                            next.</p>
                        <p>Aranha referred to the present weak position of the milreis (my 189, June
                            12, 5 p.m.<note n="22" xml:id="d365fn22">Not printed.</note>). Adding
                            “owing to the lack of export bills at this time the milreis will
                            probably be in a difficult position in about a month from now”. He then
                            said “obviously if we make substantial payments on the foreign debt on
                            July 1 the milreis will be very much affected and our carefully built up
                            existing exchange arrangements might be destroyed”. He attempted to have
                            me make a suggestion as to exactly what the Brazilian Government should
                            do, observing “it is not so much the question of the money; … we have
                            about 15 millions reserve in foreign exchange but we will need that
                            money very badly to protect the milreis this summer: what do you want us
                            to pay?” For obvious reasons I declined to make the requested suggestion
                            but did suggest that he attempt to get out of the Minister of Finance
                            today an honest opinion as to the maximum amount which could be paid on
                            the debts on July 1 … He said that he would do so.</p>
                        <p>Aranha finally remarked “in any event I know that the bondholders do not
                            know or understand anything about this and we must make a payment on the
                            first of July”.</p>

                            told me last night that he is still studying the debt matter but has not
                            yet had his conversation with the Minister of Finance as the latter has

                            situation and referred to an article he said had appeared a few days ago
                            in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> contending that Brazil is

                            (radio bulletins 145, 146, and 147) Mr. Aranha’s forthcoming

                        <p>202. Department’s 118, June 26, 6 p.m. Aranha told me very confidentially
                            this morning that yesterday the Minister of Finance came to him with a
                            draft note, addressed to me, which he had prepared for Aranha’s
                            signature (Aranha showed me the note) setting out that Brazil recognized
                            its foreign debt and instructions were being given to the Bank of Brazil
                            to set aside funds for a payment to be made thereon at a date to be
                            fixed in the near future. The note also contained an invitation to the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council to send representatives here to
                            discuss a final settlement of the whole debt business.</p>
                        <p>Aranha went yesterday afternoon to the President and told him that he was
                            willing to sign the note but that it would be the last document he
                            signed as a member of his Government. He said that if he remained in the
                            Government a payment should be made as promised on July 1. The Minister
                            of Finance was brought into the discussion and produced an article from
                            the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> allegedly setting out that the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council would not accept any unilateral
                            arrangements. Souza Costa said, “Therefore it would be better to make no
                            payment at all at this time”. Aranha still insisted on the July 1st
                            payment, telling the President that “it is essential to reestablish the
                            principle of honoring debts and of keeping promises”. The President
                            finally said that he agreed with Aranha.</p>
                        <p>The President is to see the Minister of Finance again today and Aranha
                            hopes to let me have a reply this evening.</p>
                        <p>The milreis went to 23 yesterday on the open market.</p>

                        <p>121. Please inform Aranha, and request him to inform the President, that
                            the steps reported in your 202 for meeting the debt situation on July 1
                            seem to us regrettably and decidedly inadequate.</p>
                        <p>We express this opinion out of a sense of the great possibilities that
                            exist in the various fields of economic cooperation between the two
                            countries. The agreements worked out in Washington contemplate such
                            large-scale and permanent cooperation. This Government stands fully
                            ready to go forward promptly with the discussions that are necessary
                            preliminaries to translating those agreements into performance. It will
                            be most beneficial and helpful if Brazil takes steps to regularize its
                            debt situation in this country; that is the reason for including the
                            matter in the arrangements worked out. Remembering that in our
                            discussions with Aranha the sum of $9,000,000 as an annuity on the
                            service of the dollar bonds was the smallest sum mentioned, please
                            suggest and urge upon Aranha that the amount proffered on July 1 should
                            be raised to $4,500,000. This would be a more adequate sign of Brazilian
                            recognition of the debt and willingness to work out terms of
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it is believed that immediately and simultaneously an
                            official invitation should be telegraphed by the Brazilian Government to
                            the Protective Council to commence negotiations at once for a
                            settlement.</p>

                        <p>209. Departments’ 121, June 30, 10 a.m. Aranha referred again this
                            morning to the debt matter and remarked that 4 months ago no one here,
                            Brazilian or foreign, thought he could possibly secure a payment at this
                            time on the dollar bonds. It had been necessary to bring about a change
                            in the President’s and the army’s entire attitude. He said that it is
                            “the first step that counts”. Having once brought the President around,
                            he believes that in the future the situation will continue to improve
                            and that we will be able to secure a satisfactory settlement of our
                            whole debt business.</p>
                        <p>The President decided yesterday afternoon to inform the Cabinet next
                            Tuesday that he intends definitely to adopt a policy of full cooperation
                            with the United States and for that reason is making a payment on the
                            dollar bonds and no payments on the bonds held in the European nations.
                            Aranha reminded me that many of the Cabinet are opposed to these
                            payments, but he feels sure, after the President’s declaration, they
                            will change their attitude. “I know the amount is very small,” he added
                            “but the important thing is to implant the principle and to start the
                            ball rolling in the right direction.”</p>

                        <p>Observing “in any event this is a good example for the many other
                            countries, especially those in Latin America, who owe you money and are
                            paying nothing.”</p>

                        <p>211. Second paragraph my 209, July 1, 2 p.m. The Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs tells me that at the meeting held yesterday the President stated
                            that he had definitely decided that a settlement should be made with the
                            holders of Brazil’s dollar bonds and he had suggested that a
                            representative of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council come to Rio
                            in the near future to that end. The Cabinet unanimously approved his
                            decision. The President went on to say that he had definitely decided
                            also on a policy of entire cooperation with the United States. The
                            Cabinet again unanimously approved. The meeting was attended by the full
                            Cabinet and the principal members of the Armed Forces. This of course
                            represents an entire change of the attitude on the part of the President
                            and army from that of a year and a half ago.</p>
                        <p>Aranha added that they were intensely annoyed with a telegram he had
                            received from the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council.</p>

                        <p>125. For the Ambassador from the Under Secretary.<note n="26" xml:id="d376fn26">Sumner Welles.</note> I had this morning a long
                            conversation with Francis White<note n="27" xml:id="d376fn27">President
                                of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.</note> with
                            regard to the Brazilian debt situation. White has prevented his
                            Executive Committee from issuing any statement to the public here and
                            will refrain from sending any further telegrams to the Brazilian
                            Government for the time being. He tells me that it is absolutely
                            impossible for the Council to send any representatives to Rio de Janeiro
                            to undertake negotiations there. They have no personnel that they can
                            employ for that purpose, and they have literally no funds at their
                            disposal to <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0374"/>utilize in payment
                            of the expenses and work of some outside person whom they might
                            engage.</p>
                        <p>As I explained to the Brazilian Ambassador here, while I recognize fully
                            and appreciate greatly the efforts made by Aranha and I likewise
                            recognize the value of the principle involved in the decision now
                            reached by the Brazilian Government, the failure of the Brazilian
                            Government to live up to the letter of the assurances officially given
                            last winter has without question created a very unfortunate effect upon
                            public opinion in the United States. The most helpful step that could
                            now be taken would be the announcement on the part of the Council or on
                            the part of the Brazilian Government that negotiations will be commenced
                            on a definite date to be set as near in the future as possible for the
                            purpose of arriving at a definite agreement for the resumption of
                            service on that portion of the debt held in the United States. Since it
                            is absolutely impossible for the Council to send a representative to
                            negotiate in Rio de Janeiro, I hope you will urge as strongly as
                            possible upon Aranha the desirability of sending a representative of the
                            Brazilian Government to New York for this purpose. If such a step could
                            be taken in the near future, I believe it would greatly remedy the
                            unfortunate impression which now exists. Such a step would likewise
                            avoid the possibility that negotiations for resumption of service on the
                            American held debt might be confused with similar negotiations with
                            regard to the debt held in England or in France. In the latter
                            connection White informed me that he had received word from Lord
                                Bessborough<note n="28" xml:id="d376fn28">President of the Council
                                of Foreign Bondholders, London.</note> by cable from London this
                            morning that the British had been invited to send representatives to
                            discuss resumption of debt service in Rio at the end of the present
                            month. In his reply White will maintain the position that the American
                            negotiations are separate from the negotiations of the British and
                            French creditors.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph me the result of your conversations with Aranha.

                        <p>215. For Under Secretary. Department’s 125, July 6. Aranha says that he
                            is convinced that if they send a representative to the United States to
                            undertake the negotiations, the negotiations will have no chance of
                            success. He said “… I am willing to supply the necessary <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0375"/>funds for the expenses and work of a
                            representative of the American bondholders incidental to his coming
                            here. As soon as the Bondholders Committee is ready to give us the dates
                            the Brazilian Government will be glad to announce the opening of the
                            negotiations on the date the Committee chooses. I repeat that the
                            negotiations in the United States would get absolutely nowhere. I am so
                            deeply involved in this business that I want them to prosper”.</p>

                            July 27. Dr. Munro can stay until September 9 if necessary, but must

                        <p>219. For the Under Secretary. My 218, July 17, 7 p.m.<note n="30" xml:id="d379fn30">Not printed.</note> Unless the Council changes its
                            belligerent attitude it will not be possible to accomplish anything
                            satisfactory on the debts. If their telegrams do nothing else, they give
                            Aranha an opportunity for building up a case <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0376"/>for washing his hands of the whole business. … Aranha
                            has talked so much about the telegrams that there is now a very hostile
                            atmosphere created toward the Council even all over the Foreign Office.
                            …</p>
                        <p>Whether Aranha is sincere or not every time he gets a telegram from the
                            Council it takes me considerable conversation to get him back into the
                            mood of saying that he will go ahead with making arrangements for the
                            negotiations with our bondholders.</p>
                        <p>Aranha finally went on to say that his present plan is to lay down a
                            policy that Brazil will pay debts out of her commercial capacity to pay
                            having regard to her balance of trade with each separate country. The
                            result in our case of course would be that our bondholders would be
                            favored; the French also to some extent; and the British not at all.</p>

                        <p>131. Your 219, July 18, 4 p.m. The Council states that it has sent two
                            telegrams to Aranha, the first on July 1, reminding the Brazilian
                            Government of its agreement to resume service on July 1 (which the
                            Department did its best to persuade the Council not to send), and the
                            second on July 11, setting forth the arrangements for Dr. Munro’s visit.
                            The Council states that failing to have a reply from Aranha as to
                            whether the arrangements were satisfactory, it has been compelled to
                            release the passage which it had reserved for Dr. Munro on the plane
                            leaving Miami July 23. A new reservation has been made on the next
                            plane, leaving Miami July 26.</p>
                        <p>The Council has informed the Department that it will send no
                            more-telegrams but it cannot instruct Dr. Munro to proceed to Brazil
                            unless it receives a reply from Aranha indicating that the arrangements
                            outlined in its telegram of July 11 are satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The Department is fully aware of the difficulties confronting Aranha and
                            appreciates what he has done to advance matters even to this point. It
                            is hoped that he can be induced to take the next essential step of
                            telegraphing the Council as soon as possible in order that Dr. Munro can
                            leave on July 26.</p>

                        <p>225. Department’s 131, July 20, 1 p.m. Aranha approves designation of
                            Munro and suggests that he arrive here by the 15th of August. The
                            Brazilian Government will then be in a position to take up the debt
                            matter seriously. He does not believe that the discussions need continue
                            more than a couple of weeks. He suggests also that the Council fix a
                            definite amount for Munro’s expenses. He will not, however, pay for
                            telephone conversations. (In my opinion the Council made a mistake in
                            accepting Aranha’s offer to pay these expenses. …) He [desires] the
                            Department to transmit the invitation to Munro to the Council as he is
                            not willing at their [<hi rend="italic">this?</hi>] time to telegraph to

                            as to the situation arising from the war menace. A rumor that the debts
                            might be paid in milreis was denied as not worth attention.]</p>
                        <p>In closing I urged him to press the Minister of Finance for some action.
                            He said that he would do so.</p>

                        <p>284. My 278, August 31, 4 p.m. Brazilian financial circles are in a state
                            of intense depression today but it is my opinion that when the present
                            confusion clears up the Brazilian authorities will be in a position to
                            negotiate a settlement with our bondholders. A member of the Brazilian
                            Debt Commission gave Munro yesterday a memorandum in which the figure
                            $12,000,000 was mentioned as the amount Brazil might possibly be able to
                            set aside for annual payment on all of her foreign bonds. Aranha
                            mentioned the same figure to me yesterday as a “possible maximum”.</p>
                        <p>However, Brazilian authorities will probably now plead inability to make
                            commitments at this juncture in face of loss of important European
                            markets.</p>
                        <p>Principal British bondholders representative is endeavoring leave Rio as
                            soon as possible. Munro will remain until the 9th. (In any event there
                            is no air passage available before that date.)</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Dr. Dana
                            Munro had another talk with the Minister of Finance yesterday afternoon.
                            The Minister said that of course everything was being changed by the
                            outbreak of war in Europe, that its repercussions had left them little
                            time to think about the debt question during the past week, but that
                            obviously the resulting uncertainty made it impossible to do anything
                            about debt payments at present. He went on to say that if Brazil’s
                            export proceeds begin to show an improvement and conditions thus become
                            favorable following the present uncertainty he will be glad to take up
                            the debt matter again. He had made the same statement the day before to
                            Sir Bertram Hornsby, the representative of the British bondholders.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Munro has accordingly arranged to return to the United States on the
                            plane leaving here Saturday. While the outbreak of war has prevented any
                            immediate concrete accomplishment on his part, his trip has enabled him
                            to become familiar with the way things are going here, and any
                            continuation of the negotiations that may be desirable can be carried on
                            from the United States, probably through the Brazilian Ambassador
                            there.</p>
                        <p>As Dr. Munro took leave of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the latter
                            assured him that he would be glad to carry on with him any
                            correspondence about the debts that might be appropriate, and took
                            occasion to reiterate that as far as he, the Minister, was concerned,
                            the earlier communications from the Foreign Bondholders’ Protective
                            Council had not left him very well disposed toward negotiations with the
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>The French and British bondholders’ representatives have given Dr. Munro
                            the impression that the present situation in Europe makes them so
                            desirous of an immediate settlement that they would be willing to accept
                            almost any terms, however unfavorable, that the Brazilians might offer
                            them now. However, Sir Bertram Hornsby, who is the principal British
                            negotiator, is leaving today to return to London, and it is understood
                            that Mr. René Berger, the French representative, is also preparing to
                            leave, indicating that they consider it hopeless to try to obtain even
                            an unfavorable settlement in the present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Phillimore, the second British representative, is still here but
                            this is primarily because he is now working in the British Embassy, <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0380"/>helping with its suddenly
                            increased volume of business. The Portuguese negotiator never actually
                            came to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to previous correspondence
                            having to do with negotiations for the resumption of payments on the
                            Brazilian foreign debt, I have the honor to report that in informal
                            conversation today with the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs I
                            remarked to him that although I appreciate fully the present
                            difficulties of the Brazilian Government in the way of making a
                            settlement at this time of their foreign debts, I do not expect the
                            Brazilian Government to take advantage of this situation and attempt to
                            put off indefinitely the resumption of the interrupted conversations.
                            The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he concurs with me on
                            this.</p>

                        <p>392. My despatch No. 2003, November 3, 1939.<note n="32" xml:id="d387fn32">Not printed.</note> Brazil’s improved exchange
                            position under temporary war conditions is reviving the question of
                            servicing the foreign debt. The Minister of Finance has told the
                            European bondholders representatives he likes the so-called Schroeder
                            Plan under which if agreed upon Brazil would pay annually on the whole
                            debt a fixed service of 3,000,000 pounds sterling plus a variable
                            service contingent upon an increase in the price of certain exports. The
                            plan is going forward by next air mail. It is familiar to the J. Henry
                            Schroeder Banking Corporation of New York though possibly not to the
                            Bondholders Protective Council.</p>
                        <p>The Europeans will oppose it in its present form. Moreover, they would
                            prefer a temporary settlement although they are extremely eager for
                            immediate payments on one basis or another. They are preparing <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0381"/>counter-proposals and have also
                            made certain objections to the above plan which the Minister said he
                            would study. He told them he would call them within a few days to a
                            meeting at which he wanted to discuss specific proposals.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs keeps me currently informed; he tells me
                            Souza Costa suggested Schroeder Plan because he believes European
                            representatives will reject it. Both Ministers want suggestions from me.
                            If Council cares to express an opinion on Schroeder Plan or make other
                            suggestions or proposals I can put Adams in touch with Costa.</p>
                        <p>British representative tells me he will suggest a scale of payments to
                            the Brazilian Government which would be favorable to British interests
                            and detrimental to ours. If we sit quietly by and take no part in the
                            conversations the British, French and Portuguese representatives may
                            eventually secure a settlement and we might find ourselves left out in
                            the cold.</p>

                            consideration before any other Brazilian foreign debt and that in any
                            settlement it would receive terms at least as favorable as those
                            extended to the creditors of any other nationality. This remains, of
                            course, our expectation. The Department assumes that as and when you may
                            find it necessary to recall statements to this effect by the Brazilian
                            Government you will do so and will make completely clear the fact that
                            any settlement with investors of other nationalities that ignored the
                            dollar debt or had as a direct or indirect consequence discrimination
                            against the holders of the dollar debt or unjust terms would of course
                            create great criticism here.</p>
                        <p>The Department is ready to discuss the matter of resumption of debt
                            service with the Brazilian Government.</p>
                        <p>For your information only as to the request of the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs and the Finance Minister to you for suggestions, the Department
                            would prefer to postpone making such suggestions for a short while. We
                            probably will apply ourselves to the task of trying to work out an
                            adjustment of the Colombian bonds in the immediate future and believe we
                            will be in a better position to deal with this <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0382"/>Brazilian situation then. However, of
                            course, if there is any danger of a development seriously threatening
                            the interests of the holders of dollar bonds, we might have to revise
                            this plan.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department fully informed.</p>

                        <p>235. The Department has been apprized of the receipt by the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council of a telegram of November 23 from the
                            Council of Foreign Bondholders in London expressing the hope that this
                            Government will press the Brazilian Government to formulate debt service
                            proposals without delay.</p>
                        <p>The Department was subsequently approached by the Financial Counselor of
                            the British Embassy and by the Counselor of the French Embassy,
                            independently, for a statement affirming this Government’s support of a
                            general settlement of the Brazilian foreign debt. The British official
                            left an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> stating that the British
                            Council believes the Brazilian Government to be prepared to formulate
                            proposals on the basis of the 1934 Aranha plan and that the British
                            Government hoped the Department would accede to the British Council’s
                            suggestion that you be requested to approach the Brazilian Government in
                            the premises. (The British and French representations to the Department
                            apparently result from the reported attitude of the Finance

                        <p>Any independent settlement reached with the Europeans prior to a
                            settlement of the dollar portion of the Brazilian debt might not only
                            provoke violent criticism by American bondholders but it might also, by
                            creating an opening for Congressional criticism, prejudice the future of
                            our cooperative financial relations with Brazil (Aranha’s explanation in
                            your despatch no. 2112<note n="35" xml:id="d389fn35">November 24, not

                            the way open for a “more generous arrangement with us” to the contrary
                            notwithstanding).</p>
                        <p>It is therefore suggested, if you perceive no objection, that at an

                                <item>The Department continues to believe that a settlement in the
                                    near future of the American portion of the debt is highly
                                    desirable. (This Government is in fact now giving special
                                    attention to the South American bond problem).</item>

                                    Government, as part of the general plan for solving the debt
                                    problem and as an indication of Brazil’s willingness to make a
                                    definitive settlement, is now exploring the European angle with
                                    the agents at present in Rio de Janeiro. It is hoped however
                                    that the Brazilian Government will give careful consideration to
                                    the effect which a solution of the European phase alone would
                                    have on Congress and on public opinion in this country,
                                    vis-à-vis Brazil, unless it will work out its settlement with
                                    dollar bondholders simultaneously, at least, with anything it
                                    works out with other bondholders. Certainly no scheme should be
                                    concluded before a settlement with dollar bondholders is
                                    reached.</item>

                                <item>The Department hopes that the present studies being undertaken
                                    by the Brazilian Government will result in providing a
                                    satisfactory basis for negotiations, and that this basis must
                                    assure dollar bondholders equitable treatment as compared with
                                    other bondholders. The comparative position of the dollar
                                    issues, including state and municipal issues, should be
                                    recognized as they were in the original Aranha plan, which was
                                    accepted as being relatively fair as between the holders of
                                    different issues.</item>

                            review briefly below the debt situation.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, on invitation from the Brazilian Government,
                            representatives from the United States, English and French bondholders
                            came here last August to begin debt negotiations; the war intervened;
                            the United States representative returned to the United States; the
                            other representatives remained here and continued negotiations (joined
                            later by a Portuguese representative); these European representatives
                            finally reached understandings with the Minister of Finance on the basis
                            of which they could probably conclude an agreement acceptable to their
                            principals. The Minister of Finance offered them a permanent settlement
                            (of the total debt in all currencies) with annual service of 3,000,000
                            pounds sterling rising perhaps to 5 after a year or two. The Europeans
                            were willing apparently to accept this figure on one basis or
                            another.</p>
                        <p>They are not willing to accept lower terms than they were in August for
                            two reasons: war conditions in their countries and the fact that their
                            personal reputations as negotiators are at stake were they to leave
                            empty handed after all these months here. They would prefer to have the
                            above sum allotted to the Federal debt, ignoring for the present <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0384"/>the State and municipal issues
                            in which we are more interested, and persuaded the Minister to agree to
                            this. At this juncture I took action last week to prevent either a
                            settlement of the Federal debt alone or any other agreement with the
                            Europeans prior to negotiating with us. The Europeans are, of course,
                            continuing to urge an immediate settlement.</p>
                        <p>For some time the Minister of Finance has been desirous of our taking
                            part in the negotiations (and now insistently so) but my hands were tied
                            by Department’s telegram 223, of November 15, noon. In the meantime
                            Aranha, as frequently reported, has been urging that a settlement should
                            be made first with the Europeans and then he said a more favorable
                            settlement could be made with us later.</p>
                        <p>If we are not going to negotiate until later and oppose any settlement
                            before then I should like to make this clear to the Brazilian Government
                            because the whole business is getting into a muddle.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs continues to urge us not to have
                            anything to do with the Europeans … I have no doubt Aranha sincerely
                            means this. However, it is my impression that once lower terms were
                            accepted by the Europeans we would run into obvious practical
                            difficulties in getting better terms for our bondholders for the Federal
                            bonds at least: President Vargas says he is “interested in doing
                            something for the Americans” but if faced with an European invoice on
                            terms very favorable to Brazil he might readily adopt the position that
                            we should be as easy on Brazil as they were (having in mind the fact
                            that the public and particularly the army in general still do not see
                            why the debt should be paid at all).</p>
                        <p>In view of their trade balances the Europeans are not in as strong a
                            bargaining position as we are although they will use what pressure they
                            can especially the fact that the English and French are now making
                            considerable “war purchases” here. Were we to use real pressure we could
                            either increase the above figures or obtain real preferential treatment;
                            but this would be resented of course.</p>
                        <p>If we do wish to participate in the negotiations I should appreciate any
                            instructions the Department may wish to give regarding constructive
                            proposals—especially whether to propose maintenance of the relative
                            status of the various issues in all currencies as defined in the Aranha
                            plan. This would leave the total amount to be paid on the entire debt as
                            the sole major matter for negotiation and determination.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, we cannot leave the situation as it now stands: we must either
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) negotiate ourselves or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) attempt to stop all discussions between the Brazilians and
                            the Europeans (this of course would be opposed by both those sides.)</p>

                        <p>249. Your 456, December 28, 2 p.m. In view of Aranha’s statements last
                            March we have proceeded with various phases of the cooperative
                            arrangements in the belief that Brazil would fulfill its undertakings.
                            Therefore we have confidently expected at least equal treatment with
                            respect to debts. Public opinion here (of bondholders, the press and in
                            Congress) has closely followed developments since the conversations,
                            such as failure to resume service on July 1, the suspension of
                            negotiations with the Council and the several operations of the
                            Export-Import Bank which have favored Brazil more than any other
                            American republic. The Department must therefore again emphasize the
                            importance of avoiding any postponement or appearance of postponement of
                            action on behalf of American bondholders in deference to European
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the Department does not wish to take any action which
                            will discourage the gratifying desire manifested by the Brazilian
                            Government to reach a settlement and feels that this opportunity to
                            further a prompt settlement for the holders of dollar bonds should not
                            be lost.</p>
                        <p>The Department is consequently orally informing the British and French
                            representatives (please see Department’s 235 of December 12, 4 p.m.)
                            that this Government will actively support at Rio the interests of
                            American bondholders, that it will not countenance any partial
                            settlement favoring European bondholders at the expense of American
                            bondholders, and that any agreement must make some provision for all
                            dollar bonds.</p>
                        <p>You are therefore authorized in your discretion to participate informally
                            and independently in debt discussions with the appropriate Brazilian
                            authorities for the purpose of ascertaining what terms the Brazilians
                            are prepared to offer.</p>
                        <p>If the Brazilian Government is prepared to enter into discussions of the
                            dollar debt, as we greatly hope, the Department will give immediate
                            consideration to the question of whether the Council can play a useful
                            role in those discussions, and as to whether it should send a
                            representative to Rio.</p>
                        <p>The basis of any terms must be comprehensive, i. e., there must be
                            provision for all dollar bonds in some schedule similar to the Aranha
                            plan. To leave the State and municipal debts in default—a condition
                            created largely by the Brazilian control of exchange—while payments were
                            being received by European bondholders on a large volume <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0386"/>of securities would cause great
                            dissatisfaction which would hinder us in all our dealings with Brazil in
                            the economic and financial sphere.</p>
                        <p>The amounts currently discussed are small for such a settlement and the
                            application of the proportions of the Aranha plan would result in
                            payments on some categories so small as to defeat the purposes of a debt
                            settlement. For this reason it might be difficult to conclude a
                            permanent settlement at this time. You will in this connection recall
                            that in the discussions with Aranha last February this point was brought
                            up and his letter to the Secretary of State mentioned that a
                            transitional arrangement would initially be adopted, to be followed,
                            upon an improvement in Brazil’s foreign commerce, by an equitable and
                            satisfactory permanent settlement. Our surmise is that a plan based on
                            small payments would be far more likely to secure acceptance if placed
                            on a temporary basis.</p>

                        <p>461. Department’s 249, December 29, 7 p.m. [Here follows passage
                            commending Aranha’s good faith and his efforts in the bond payment
                            matter with the statement that Aranha was now in a better frame of mind
                            with respect to the situation than at any time since the suspension of
                            payments.] President Vargas has said several times recently and repeated
                            yesterday that he is interested in doing something for “American and
                            Portuguese bondholders only”.</p>
                        <p>I sent my 456, December 28, 2 p.m., for three reasons: <list>

                                <item>The situation described was brought about by the fact that the
                                    European representatives remained here after the outbreak of the
                                    war and continued persistent efforts to protect their interests
                                    the best way they could. [Apparent omission] did not suspend the
                                    “negotiations with the Council” as the Department apparently
                                    believes: Costa asked Munro to remain here and continue
                                    negotiating but Munro had to return for his Princeton classes;
                                    also at the time in view of the outbreak of the war the outlook
                                    for an early settlement seemed hopeless.</item>

                                <item>In the meantime in view of Department’s No. 223, November 151

                                    telegram No. 249).</item>

                            other creditors the Minister of Finance is endeavoring to find a
                            reasonable basis for a solution of the debt problem which, however, will
                            be communicated to those creditors only after an agreement has been
                            reached with the American bondholders for the resumption of dollar
                            payments.” The Minister of Finance is informing the European
                            representatives that he can resume conversations with them only after
                            some sort of understanding on the subject with the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the last paragraph of the Department’s telegram I agree that

                                    reaches 2,500,000 pounds, more or less, with the United States.
                                    In case exchange freedom is reestablished, this amount, as well
                                    as the arrears with other countries, would weigh on exchange as
                                    a depressing element.</item>

                            <item>Official figures: $6,000,000. In addition estimated $4,500,000 for
                                unsold stocks of United States origin. Also $2,500,000 which is an
                                estimate of needs in excess of daily quotas over and above limits
                                established by the bank and which companies operating on the basis
                                of daily quotas allege represents a legitimate claim. Total
                                $13,000,000. (The estimate given above for needs in excess of daily
                                quotas would undoubtedly be contested by the Bank of Brazil which
                                would claim that this amount has already been absorbed in past

                                    from day to day in accordance with maturities and new contracts

                                <item>I venture to point out that the amount of the outstanding
                                    contracts appears to be relatively unimportant as regards the
                                    discussions with Aranha. If an agreement is arrived at resulting
                                    in the supply of adequate exchange for future imports, I am
                                    convinced that American exporters will not push for immediate
                                    payment of the outstanding contracts. These contracts are being
                                    liquidated promptly on maturity by the Bank of Brazil and the
                                    Embassy has no reason to fear that this practice will be

                            adds that his resignation will in all probability take effect upon the
                            promulgation of the new decree law at which time a new director will be
                            appointed.</p>

                            16.500 milreis. Banks may purchase future export drafts but cannot sell
                            future exchange for importations. Commercial banks will grant spot
                            exchange for current importations. Banks may not maintain “bought”
                            exchange position in excess of $5000 for 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>Commercial banks as yet have not quoted rates for the purchase of the 70%
                            of the export bills nor for the liquidation of import bills but it is
                            believed that the rates will be known late today.</p>
                        <p>The decree law took effect today.</p>
                        <p>Please inform Department of Commerce.</p>

                        <p>110. Embassy’s telegram 107, April 9, 7 p.m. Referring to article No. 3
                            of the exchange decree law Aranha informed me this morning that the
                            Government had found it necessary to increase from 10%, as agreed in
                            Washington, to 30%, the Government’s share of export drafts. He
                            explained this was on account of the international situation and
                            furthermore in order to enable the Government to build up a reserve to
                            be used in making a payment on Brazil’s dollar bonds.</p>

                        <p>112. In conversation today with Aranha and with the Exchange Director of
                            the Bank of Brazil both informed me that as soon as the acceptance
                            credits of $19,200,000 agreed upon at Washington are available, prompt
                            action will be taken to clear up American exchange arrears. In view of
                            this present cooperative attitude on the part of the Brazilian
                            authorities, I think it would be well to make these acceptance credits
                            available to the Bank of Brazil without further delay.</p>
                        <p>I venture to suggest the Embassy be advised by telegraph as to when these
                            acceptance credits will be opened.</p>

                        <p>113. Department’s 57, April 11, 6 p.m. Supplementing Aranha’s statement
                            in my 110, April 11, noon, the Director of Exchange this morning
                            informed me that it was found necessary to increase the proportion of
                            the Government’s share of exchange derived from export drafts from 10%
                            to 30% because it was decided that 10% was inadequate based upon last
                            year’s official remittances which amounted to 9,549,998 pounds. This
                            amount is roughly 17% of Brazil’s total exports in 1938, which amounted
                            to approximately $295,000,000. Moreover it <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0395"/>was deemed advisable to establish a reasonable reserve
                            fund for governmental purposes. The Director informs me in confidence
                            that the Government may allocate part of the reserve fund for
                            remittances of earnings and dividends.</p>
                        <p>Although the Bank of Brazil has not fixed a limit for its bought position
                            on compensation marks, the Director informs me that it is his intention
                            to maintain the position at a safe level for normal trading operations
                            with Germany. With respect to the compensation mark situation the
                            Director states that the bank has now adopted the following policy: The
                            Bank of Brazil will maintain the monopoly and will allow German banks to
                            purchase compensation marks only for the liquidation of their own
                            collections and all transactions will be subject to the control of the
                            Bank of Brazil. The Director states that he has issued instructions to
                            alter the quotations on compensation marks in accordance with the
                            fluctuations of exchange of international acceptance on the free market.
                            Although the German banks are now quoting a selling rate of 6 milreis
                            and a buying rate of 5 mil 500 reis for compensation marks, the Director
                            states that he will take steps at once to bring these quotations into
                            line with the policy outlined above.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Exchange is entirely disposed to allocate exchange for
                            the remittance of dividends and earnings when the exchange position of
                            the bank permits. The Director has called for a statement of the actual
                            amount of arrears of earnings and dividends now due to American
                            companies operating in Brazil. At my suggestion the Director will today
                            receive the manager of the local subsidiary of the American and Foreign
                            Power Company to discuss their exchange problems.</p>
                        <p>The Director states that the Government decided upon an official buying
                            rate of 16.500 milreis in order to acquire at this lower rate exchange
                            for official requirements of the Government. It appears to the Embassy
                            that an official selling rate for dollars based in part upon the
                            official buying rate of 16.500 milreis is more advantageous to American
                            exporters than the former rate of 17.300 milreis. For example, today
                            banks are selling dollars in liquidation of import bills at 18.500
                            milreis exclusive of the 5% tax. If the official buying rate were 17.300
                            the selling rate in the free market for dollars for payment of imports

                        <p>On the day the decree law went into effect firms offered export drafts on

                            milreis yesterday. The milreis firmed today with banks buying 70% of
                            export drafts at from 18.300 to 18.400 milreis and banks are selling
                            dollars for the liquidation of import bills at from 18.420 to 18.500
                            milreis exclusive of the 5% tax.</p>

                        <p>58. Your 112, April 11, 6 p.m. Export-Import Bank is prepared to make
                            acceptance credits available promptly on receipt of advices re
                            allocation of total amount $19,200,000 among commercial banks which are
                            to conduct actual operations. In this connection Export-Import Bank has
                            been awaiting reply to Mr. Pierson’s<note n="54" xml:id="d405fn54">Warren L. Pierson, President, Export-Import Bank of

                            Brasil (Satelgeral). Upon receipt of such advices the Export-Import Bank
                            will notify the agent commercial banks, which will in turn transmit
                            individually by airmail to the Banco do Brasil the final details of the
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Terms of arrangement are substantially as follows: Banco do Brasil is to
                            draw on designated banks within amounts separately allotted drafts of a
                            tenor not exceeding three months sight signed by duly authorized
                            officers and for individual amounts to be specified by the drawees. Said
                            drafts are to be accepted by the drawees and thereafter discounted by
                            them at the rate of 3.6% per annum proceeds being held at disposal of
                            Banco do Brasil. One day prior to maturity of acceptances Banco do
                            Brasil to pay not less than 10% of face amount in cash and present a
                            renewal draft for balance for acceptance and discount. One day before
                            maturity of renewal acceptance Banco do Brasil is to pay a further 10%
                            or more of amount of original draft in cash and present another renewal
                            draft for balance for acceptance and discount. And so on except that the
                            cash payment at time of seventh renewal is to be not less than 20% of
                            amount of original draft, leaving assuming no augmentation of payments
                            20% for the final draft. Thus all drafts would be liquidated in full
                            within 2 years. No original draft may be presented for acceptance after
                            June 30 of this year and no renewal draft after March 30, 1941 it being
                            understood and agreed that all acceptances shall be retired on or before
                            June 30, 1941.</p>
                        <p>The proceeds of these acceptance credits are, of course, to be used by
                            the Banco do Brasil only for the purposes envisaged in the exchanges of
                            letters with Aranha at Washington.</p>

                        <p>59. Your 113, April 12, 1 p.m. Reference is made to the exchange
                            arrangements mentioned in Section 1 of the letter of Aranha to the <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0397"/>Secretary of State, dated March

                            detail in the documents transmitted to the Embassy with instruction no.
                            307 of March 9, 1939.<note n="58" xml:id="d406fn58">Not
                            printed.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s position that, while minor modifications were of
                            course expected, it was anticipated that no important changes would be
                            made without prior discussion. The Department is of the opinion that the
                            increase from 10 to 30 percent in the proportion of export drafts which
                            must be sold to the Bank of Brazil at the official rate is of
                            considerable importance. Nevertheless it feels that the present
                            situation is acceptable if the increased yield is devoted primarily to
                            external debt service and transfer of earnings. We feel that the
                            Brazilian government should keep us fully and currently informed as to
                            the disposition of this official exchange.</p>
                        <p>Regarding transactions in compensation currencies, the Department assumes
                            that the understandings indicated in the memorandum of February 17,
                                1939,<note n="58" xml:id="d406fn1">Not printed.</note> will be
                            carried out in substance.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the penultimate paragraph of the Embassy’s telegram, the
                            Department, although it is not of the opinion that the point must be
                            pressed further, fails to agree with the Embassy’s argument. Since the
                            spread between the official and free buying rates is not fixed, the free
                            rate being a market rate, it would be expected on purely theoretical
                            grounds that if the official buying rate were 17.300 milreis, the free
                            buying rate would be slightly lower than 18.300 to 18.400, and the free
                            selling rate correspondingly decreased.</p>

                            made to points 4, 5 and 6 of the memorandum of February 17, 1939,
                            regarding transactions in compensation currencies which was transmitted
                            to the Embassy with instruction no. 307, March 9, 1939.<note n="59" xml:id="d408fn59">Neither printed.</note> The Brazilian
                            representatives agreed that the cross selling rate between the
                            compensation mark and the dollar should be maintained at not greater
                            than 2.95 compensation marks to the dollar, and further agreed in
                            principle that an attempt should be made to retain the existing spread
                            between the buying and selling rate of the compensation mark, exclusive
                            of tax, of 8⅓ percent of the selling rate, but stated in the event that
                            it seemed advisable they would wish to feel free to amend policy in the
                            latter matter, discussing the subject with us.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes that the present cross rate between the free selling
                            rate of 18.500 milreis to the dollar and the selling rate for
                            compensation marks of 6.100 milreis is 3.03 compensation marks to the
                            dollar. The spread between the selling rate of 6.100 milreis and the
                            buying rate of 5.700 milreis for compensation marks is 6.6 percent.</p>
                        <p>The Department assumes that the understandings regarding transactions in
                            compensation currencies will be carried out in substance, but places at
                            the discretion of the Embassy whether or not to take these specific
                            points up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Department notes
                            with interest that there has been a substantial reduction in the Bank of
                            Brazil’s bought position in compensation marks.</p>
                        <p>Please inform the Department, but without, however, bringing the matter
                            in any way to the attention of the Brazilian Government, whether any
                            progress is being made towards the establishment of a Central Reserve
                            Bank and whether there are any indications that the Brazilian Government
                            will request a loan of gold such as was envisaged in the recent

                        <p>126. Department’s 65, April 20, 4 p.m. The Director of Exchange informs
                            me that he intends gradually to bring the cross selling rate between the
                            compensation mark and the dollar and the spread between the compensation
                            mark and the dollar into line with the agreements arrived at in
                            Washington. He would not make a definite promise as to when this will be
                            accomplished as he states that the bank wishes to avoid perturbing
                            rudely trade between Brazil and Germany and working hardships on
                            Brazilian firms who already have contracts for purchases of German
                            merchandise. (In my opinion a contributing factor is the strong pressure
                            of the Sao Paulo cotton interests to protect their sales in Germany) the
                            Director assured me that he will continue to maintain a strict control
                            of the commerce between the two countries and to prevent the Banco do
                            Brasil’s “bought” position from becoming too large.</p>
                        <p>Commercial banks are purchasing export drafts on the free market at
                            18.740 to 18.750 and selling free exchange for payment of import drafts
                            at 18.900 to 3 milreis.</p>
                        <p>The selling rate for the compensation mark remains at 6.100 and the
                            buying rate at 5.700.</p>
                        <p>While I understand that the question of the Central Reserve Bank is being
                            studied no great progress appears to have been made and from present
                            indications the Brazilian Government will not request the loan of gold
                            in the near future.</p>

                        <p>77. Your 135, May 4, noon. The two Chicago Banks state they mailed
                            letters to the Banco do Brasil on April 25. The Chemical National Bank
                            states that it definitely mailed three copies of its letter in one
                            envelope, but to expedite matters it is forwarding two more copies.
                            Negotiations with the Guaranty Trust Company are pending and a final
                            determination is expected on Monday.</p>

                        <p>150. The Bank of Brazil today closed exchange for maturities and daily
                            quotas for February 17 and 18.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Exchange informs me that although he has not yet received
                            the letter from the Continental Illinois Bank and a final decision
                            regarding the participation of the Guaranty Trust Company he has decided
                            to proceed with plans for liquidating the arrears of American firms. If
                            the Guaranty Trust Company continues to reject the proposal he will
                            either give their quota of $2,000,000 to a new bank or distribute it
                            among the banks already included in the group. Before doing so however
                            he will consult the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>The Bank of Brazil’s original estimates of American firms exclusive of
                            earnings and dividends totaled $47,000,000. The Embassy pointed out that
                            this figure was too high and that it probably included commercial
                            arrears of other countries which invoice merchandise to Brazil in
                            dollars. At the request of the Embassy the Bank of Brazil reexamined the
                            records and is checking with all the commercial banks operating in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The revised estimate of American arrears now approximates $26,000,000.
                            The Director of Exchange states that in order to make up the difference
                            between the acceptance credit of $19,200,000 and the foregoing figure of
                            $26,000,000 the bank will use part of its current credits in New York
                            and London which amount to $16,000,000 and 600,000 pounds (sterling)
                            respectively.</p>

                        <p>The Director states he will send to the Export-Import Bank on May 13 a
                            letter outlining the procedure for the liquidation of American arrears.
                            He states that it is his intention to make a public announcement next
                            week both in the United States and Brazil concerning the payment of
                            American arrears.</p>

                        <p>80. Your 150, May 9, 1 p.m. The Export-Import Bank yesterday telegraphed
                            the Banco do Brasil that the Guaranty Trust Company has decided not to
                            participate, and requested that its quota be distributed to the other
                            banks suggesting the addition of a Cleveland bank to the group.</p>
                        <p>The Department notes the difference between the revised estimate of
                            American arrears of $26,000,000 and the total of $13,944,000 furnished
                            by Dr. Souza Dantas in his letter of March 8, 1939<note n="61" xml:id="d413fn61">Not printed.</note> to Mr. Warren Lee Pierson. It
                            is possible that a portion of this difference represents new arrears
                            resulting from the increased lag in closing exchange for maturities and
                            daily quotas. Please inform the Department to what extent, if any, this
                            is the case, what other explanations there may be for the difference,
                            and whether the foreign dollar and sterling balances of the bank have
                            increased correspondingly over the last 2 months or so.</p>

                            $13,944,000 furnished by Dr. Sousa Dantas in his letter of March 8,
                                1939,<note n="61" xml:id="d414fn61">Not printed.</note> to Warren
                            Lee Pierson chiefly represents new arrears resulting from the increased
                            lag in closing exchange for maturities and daily quotas. My opinion is
                            that Dr. Sousa Dantas’ figures were too <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0402"/>low. The Bank of Brazil is still checking the records
                            of commercial banks in order to ascertain the true amount of American
                            commercial arrears and the Director of Exchange is of the opinion that
                            the final figures may be lower than $26,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The foreign dollar and sterling balances of the bank have increased
                            correspondingly over the last 2 months, mainly because of the seasonal
                            sale in free foreign exchange of the Sao Paulo cotton crop.</p>

                        <p>157. As the Department is aware the Bank of Brazil has not granted
                            exchange for a number of shipments of merchandise imported into Brazil
                            before September, 1937, by firms operating on open accounts and daily
                            quotas. The Embassy has constantly reminded the Bank of Brazil of the
                            importance of allocating this exchange. Today the Bank authorized
                            purchases in the free market of exchange covering importations cleared
                            through Brazilian customhouses before September, 1937, and for which
                            exchange has not yet been granted. Inasmuch as these transactions are
                            limited to firms operating on daily quotas and open accounts, the Bank
                            has decided to increase their daily quotas by 1000 pounds each until the
                            firms’ arrears are liquidated. Firms must present proof of actual
                            importation and sale of merchandise in Brazil.</p>

                        <p>160. Department’s 80, May 10, 6 p.m. The Bank of Brazil today took steps
                            to liquidate exchange arrears of American firms by forwarding to the
                            participating banks into the United States 90-day sight drafts
                            corresponding to the credit allotted to each bank, and a letter
                            outlining the procedure for liquidating the arrears. The chief points of
                            the letter are summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>The American banks will confirm by telegraph to the Bank of Brazil the
                            actual opening of the credits on May 22nd. Bank of Brazil will release
                            to the press in Brazil and the United States the following notice: <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0403"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Bank of Brazil offers to liquidate promptly all pending
                                    collections covering merchandise of American origin for which
                                    milreis have been deposited subject, however, to a discount of
                                    six-tenths of 1 percent. If the American exporter does not wish
                                    to take advantage of this offer the Bank of Brazil will
                                    liquidate said deposits by 60 days exchange contracts without
                                    discount (interest charge). The American exporters who avail
                                    themselves of the offer of prompt liquidation of their
                                    collections are requested to take immediate steps to issue the
                                    necessary instructions of their respective collecting banks. If
                                    said instructions are not received by the collecting banks
                                    within a period of 20 days from the date of this announcement,
                                    the Bank of Brazil will reserve the right to liquidate these
                                    collections by means of 60 days exchange contracts.”</p>

                        <p>Although the foregoing notice refers only to collections (drafts) not
                            covered by exchange contracts, the Director of Exchange informs me that
                            similar treatment will be accorded to the deposits of firms operating on
                            daily quotas and open accounts for which contracts have not yet been
                            granted.</p>
                        <p>On the same date the Bank of Brazil will advise holders of exchange
                            contracts here that it will liquidate the contracts by sight draft on
                            American banks subject, however, to interest charge correspondence 3.6%
                            per annum. The holders of the contracts (chiefly firms operating on open
                            account and daily quota) will have 10 days in which to accept or reject
                            the offer. If they reject it they will receive exchange upon maturity of
                            the contracts. It is understood that the Bank of Brazil will liquidate
                            arrears on the basis of the exchange rate and the exchange tax in effect
                            at the time of the deposit of the milreis.</p>
                        <p>Bank of Brazil states definitely that it must impose an interest charge
                            correspondence 3.6 per annum. The Director states that although the
                            acceptance credits will cost Bank of Brazil 4.86% over a period of 2
                            years it is willing to restrict the charge to the basis of 3.6% per
                            annum for all American arrears.</p>
                        <p>The Director states that the interest charge will not apply to the drafts
                            of American companies under $1000 for which no exchange contracts have
                            been granted but he does not want to disclose this information. I repeat
                            that the plan refers only to American arrears.</p>

                        <p>94. The Export-Import Bank has informed the Department that the Bank of
                            Brazil proposes to charge six-tenths of 1 percent to American exporters
                            who receive immediate payment of their claims.</p>
                        <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0404"/>
                        <p>This has disturbed the Export-Import Bank inasmuch as it was not
                            contemplated at the time the credit was arranged that such charges would
                            be made. After full consideration, however, the Bank has concluded that
                            no complaint should be lodged with the Bank of Brazil on this ground.
                            You may, however, when appropriate occasion presents itself, indicate
                            informally to officials of the Bank and of the Government the
                            disappointment of the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>For your information the basis of the Bank’s decision not to make any
                            complaint is that the six-tenths of 1 percent for 60 days is equivalent
                            to 36/10 percent per annum, which is what it costs the Bank of Brazil to
                            make the cash immediately available. In addition, the funds now advanced
                            will go to shippers who made sales with the full knowledge that exchange
                            was being provided upon a delayed basis and who undoubtedly made
                            provision therefor in their prices.</p>

                            has finally been able to persuade the Director of Exchange that the Bank
                            of Brazil should not collect the discount of 0.6 per cent (six tenths of
                            1 per cent) in liquidating deposits for payment of merchandise of
                            American origin made from February 19 to April 8 inclusive for which
                            exchange contracts have not been granted. This decision which becomes
                            effective at once applies to all deposits whether for collections, open
                            accounts or daily quotas. The Bank has instructed its agencies in Brazil
                            to liquidate promptly all of these obligations. This ruling does not
                            affect the payment of exchange contracts already allocated which the
                            Bank is now paying subject to an interest charge corresponding to 3.6%
                            per annum.</p>
                        <p>Please request the Export-Import Bank to notify the 12 participating
                            banks of this decision and the Department of Commerce to advise

                        <p>179. A list of American arrears is proceeding satisfactorily and the
                            Director of Exchange informs me that all American arrears not covered by
                            exchange contracts will be paid in full before the middle of June.</p>

                        <p>The Bank of Brazil has instructed its agency in Bahia to suspend the
                            purchase of German compensation marks in payment for cocoa for
                            exportation to Germany. This decision was made after the bank received
                            notice that German firms had contracted for 240,000 bags of Bahia cocoa.
                            (Director of Exchange suspects that the German firms intend to dispose

                        <p>204. Department’s 119, June 26, 7 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. It is estimated that the 30% of exchange acquired by the Bank
                                    of Brazil at the official exchange rate which will approximate
                                        <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0406"/>$75,000,000
                                    annually has already produced $15,000,000. The present
                                    unexpended balance of the latter figure amounts to $2,373,000.
                                    About $50,000,000 may cover all the currently estimated annual
                                    official exchange requirements of the Government (Embassy’s
                                    telegram 113, April 12). The balance will be used as a working
                                    fund for the Bank of Brazil. Since the new exchange regime began
                                    the official exchange requirements of the Government have been
                                    averaging about $50,000,000 annually the balance has permitted
                                    the Bank of Brazil to check sharp breaks in exchange rates
                                    without entering the market as the largest buyer. When expedient
                                    the bank also draws on the balance to pay quotas of $360,000
                                    daily (Embassy’s despatch No. 1396, June 26<note n="63" xml:id="d421fn63">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                                <p>Earning and interest transfers are not regularly made but the
                                    bank has in exceptional cases granted exchange for earnings and
                                    administrative expenses. In some instances it grants weekly
                                    quotas and when the amounts are small it sells exchange for the
                                    entire amount (Embassy’s despatch No. 1155 [<hi rend="italic">1255</hi>], April 29 and telegram 159, May 13<note n="64" xml:id="d421fn64">Neither printed.</note>). These
                                    remittances are made through the special free exchange market
                                    and not from the 30% fund of official exchange. The selling rate
                                    on the special free market is now 21 mil 850 reis plus a tax of
                                    10%. The Bank of Brazil has sanctioned private transactions
                                    provided that the foreign exchange offered represents new
                                    capital for investment in Brazil. In such cases the bank
                                    receives 30% of the exchange at the official rate and imposes a
                                    remittance tax of 10%. Such transactions have been made recently
                                    at rates approximating 25 milreis for the 70%. The Director of
                                    Exchange informs me in confidence that the present tax of 10% on
                                    the special free market will shortly be reduced to 5%, also that
                                    commercial banks will be permitted to purchase personal checks
                                    not in excess of $500 each at the buying rate on the special
                                    free market. This will tend to restrict bootleg operations. The
                                    director States that commercial arrears of countries other than
                                    the United States and Germany for which exchange has not been
                                    closed amount to 15,522,640. He intends to expedite the
                                    liquidation of these arrears and when accomplished to inaugurate
                                    a plan of regular remittances of earnings and dividends. The
                                    delay in the liquidation of these arrears results from current
                                    negotiations with the Bank of Brazil for unfreezing agreements
                                    similar to the American agreements.</p>
                            <p>2. American commercial arrears have been cleared up although some of
                                the drafts are still en route to the United States. Commercial
                                payments are being made to Americans on a current basis. The
                                director again informs me that a detailed statement of the
                                settlement of American <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0407"/>arrears as described in the second paragraph of your telegram will
                                not be available for about 15 days because of the delay in receipt
                                of information from banks in remote parts of the country (Embassy’s
                                despatch No. 1339, June 2 and 1346, June 5<note n="65" xml:id="d421fn65">Neither printed.</note>).</p>
                            <p>3. On June 1 the Bank of Brazil’s “bought” position in compensation
                                marks amounted to 3,400,000 compensation marks. During [apparent
                                omission] German firms purchased approximately 36,000 metric tons of
                                Sao Paulo cotton with the result that on June 29 the “bought”
                                position reached 15,985,488 compensation marks (Embassy’s telegram
                                189, June 12 and despatch No. 1359, June 12<note n="65" xml:id="d421fn1">Neither printed.</note>). The director informed
                                me that the cotton will be exported in such a way as to allow the
                                market to absorb the compensation marks and reduce the risk of the
                                bank.</p>

                        <p>269. Owing to the European situation the Bank of Brazil is restricting
                            the purchase of exchange to dollar export bills. The bank is selling
                            dollar exchange at 19 milreis 950 for dollar collections received by it
                            and for daily quotas. Firms applying for other exchange for the
                            liquidation of import bills are requested to deposit milreis at the
                            rates in effect on August 24 or purchase from other banks at prevailing
                            rates.</p>
                        <p>Other banks are restricting purchases to actual requirements. They are
                            paying 19 milreis 950 to 20 milreis for export bills and selling dollar
                            exchange for their own collections at approximately 20 milreis 150.</p>
                        <p>The Director of Exchange informs me that the bank’s position in pound is
                            just about equal to the current unpaid obligations in pound. Also that
                            the bank’s position in German compensation marks is approximately
                            7,400,000 compensation marks and that in the event of war the bank could
                            liquidate this position without loss.</p>

                        <p>317. The expected switch in orders to the United States is very
                            noticeable. The principal obstacle is the exchange of cash in the United
                            States before shipment. This is further complicated by Brazilian
                            exchange regulations.</p>
                        <p>In view of the number of appeals received by the Embassy from Brazilian
                            importers, the Embassy today discussed this matter with the Director of
                            Exchange and obtained an important concession.</p>
                        <p>Although the banks are permitted to open credits abroad (my telegram
                            number 251 of August 17, 1939<note n="66" xml:id="d425fn66">Not
                                printed.</note>) they are reluctant to do so because the Bank of
                            Brazil is not guaranteeing the delivery of future exchange. The Director
                            of Exchange now assures me that the bank will close future exchange for
                            credits opened in the United States for the purchase of essential
                            products. This action will facilitate purchases of steel products,
                            chemicals, pulp, et cetera formerly imported from European countries.
                            Each case will be decided upon its own merits.</p>

                            merchandise cleared through Brazilian customhouses.</p>
                        <p>The exchange balance of the bank now approximates $7,200,000. The bank

                            19.830 and milreis 19.980 respectively. Exchange operations are
                            normal.</p>

                        <p>329. The exchange situation is very favorable. There is adequate cover

                            19.880 (and selling at milreis 19.980). The milreis continues to firm on

                            for monthly exchange quotas for these items. Companies whose records
                            have been approved by the Bank will receive monthly quotas within the
                            exchange possibilities of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>American companies that have not applied for this exchange should do so
                            at once.</p>

                        <p>It was made clear that any informal trade-agreement conversations
                            undertaken would be conducted on an <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi>
                            basis; Mr. Hawkins stated that he would report the results of the
                            conversations to the Committee on Trade Agreements, and Señor Gazitúa
                            (who is returning to Chile at the end of August) indicated that he would
                            report to his Government.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that the discussion of a possible trade agreement
                            could be divided into three parts: the general provisions, the
                            concessions which would be requested of Chile, and the concessions which
                            we might be able to grant to Chile. It was decided to discuss first
                            Chilean export products to the United States. In this connection, it was
                            explained that no commitment whatever could be given regarding any
                            concession prior to notice and hearings in this country, and therefore
                            we could merely indicate those Chilean products which, on the basis of
                            preliminary study, might be considered for concessions in a trade
                            agreement. Señor Gazitúa expressed interest in all products so indicated
                            and, in addition, on the basis of data prepared by the Chilean
                            Government, inquired about the possibility of considering tomatoes,
                            celery, processed garlic (later Señor Gazitúa indicated that no garlic
                            in paste, etc. is exported from Chile to the United States), cherries,
                            and chick peas. He also inquired as to whether, if it should be found
                            that duty reductions could be granted on peaches and prunes, such
                            reductions might be considered in the case of peaches for the period
                            January 1 to April 15 and in the case of prunes for the period December
                            15 to March 30. After consideration of these inquiries, Señor Gazitúa
                            was informed that evidently imports from Chile into the United States of
                            tomatoes and celery (the duty on which was reduced by 50 percent from
                            April 15 to July 31 in the United Kingdom agreement) are negligible;
                            that it might be possible to consider Chilean chick peas on the basis of
                            size; and that the duty on fresh cherries had already been reduced by 50
                            percent in the Canadian agreement. Señor Gazitúa was also informed that
                            it would appear that consideration could be given to the seasonal
                            periods he suggested in regard to peaches and plums if it should be
                            found possible to grant concessions on those products.</p>
                        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa inquired as to the major suppliers to the United States of
                            limes and lemons during the period from June 1 to September 30 and the
                            amounts supplied in that period. He also inquired—whether the manganese
                            concession in the Brazilian agreement covers Chilean manganese; asked
                            about glue for carpenters, the duty on soap bark cut in pieces; and
                            indicated that Chile might be interested in baldo leaf.</p>
                        <p>Concerning copper, Señor Gazitúa was advised that further study was being
                            given to that product. It was pointed out that the question of copper
                            was an involved one and Señor Gazitúa indicated that the matter of a
                            possible concession on copper would be largely left to our
                            determination.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa indicated that in regard to a number of products, which our
                            preliminary studies had not indicated as possible concession items,
                            Chile was interested only in most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the question of tariff concessions by Chile, Señor Gazitúa
                            was informed that we did not contemplate requesting drastic duty
                            reductions which would worsen Chile’s exchange position. He was
                            informed, however, that the United States would desire an improvement in
                            or continuance of existing Chilean customs treatment on such American
                            export products as automotive vehicles and parts, rice, lumber, raw
                            cotton, radios, cotton yarn, refrigerators, typewriters, etc.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa referred to the possibility of a concession on automobiles
                            on a weight classification basis, (mentioning particularly the new
                            Crosley light-weight car), and to the fact that the development of rice
                            production in Chile would make a concession on that product difficult.
                            In regard to lumber, it was indicated that there were imports into Chile
                            of Douglas fir and some imports of Southern pine. Señor Gazitúa stated
                            that American typewriters encountered strong competition in Chile from
                            German typewriters and that there is domestic production of parts in
                            Chile. He also stated, in connection with cotton, that Chile had made
                            tariff quota reductions in cotton cloth (Tacna cloth) to Peru. Señor
                            Gazitúa also mentioned that articles, such as razor blades and
                            cigarettes, which are now subject to smuggling into Chile might be
                            considered as concession items.</p>
                        <p>Our position, as embodied in the pertinent general provisions, regarding
                            internal and compensating taxes and charges (other than ordinary customs
                            duties) imposed on the importation of scheduled products, was fully
                            explained. Señor Gazitúa indicated no objection in regard to these
                            matters. He stated that Chile has internal taxes only on tobacco,
                            liquors and sparkling wines. In regard to the tax on tobacco, he said
                            American tobacco was not now accorded equal treatment <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0415"/>with Cuban tobacco and assumed that we
                            would wish this adjusted under the internal tax provisions of an
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The “standard” provisions concerning the bases and methods of determining
                            dutiable value in the case of ad valorem rates were discussed and Señor
                            Gazitúa requested an informal memorandum setting forth this Government’s
                            construction of these provisions. He also requested an explanation of
                            the method used by our Treasury in regard to determining the dutiable
                            value of Chilean products subject to ad valorem rates. In this
                            connection, he stated that the conversion rate used by our Treasury in
                            the case of Chilean products was the Chilean official exchange rate,
                            which is not used in Chile for commercial transactions, rather than the
                            higher export draft rate, and that this resulted in the collection of a
                            greater amount of duty on those Chilean products to which ad valorem
                            rates apply. He also stated that the Chilean Government now converts
                            currency for duty purposes in terms of the gold peso but might wish to
                            change its conversion rate.</p>
                        <p>This Government’s position in regard to quantitative restrictions was
                            explained at length in general discussion and on the basis of the
                            pertinent articles. Señor Gazitúa indicated general concurrence both as
                            regards the provisions and the explanation given him as to the method of
                            administering quotas contemplated by those provisions.</p>
                        <p>Our position in regard to the imposition of quotas on scheduled products
                            was carefully explained and the usual grounds on which quotas could be
                            established on such products was outlined. In addition it was indicated,
                            subject of course to the <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> character
                            of the conversations, that an agreement might also permit the
                            establishment of quotas for the protection of the exchange value of the
                            currency of either country.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa indicated that Chile had established quotas on a number of
                            products and stated that the present Chilean quotas on automobiles,
                            while not imposed for any of the reasons which would permit a quota
                            under an agreement, were established to benefit American automobiles as
                            compared with German automobiles.</p>
                        <p>It was proposed to Señor Gazitúa that the Chilean Government, under a
                            trade agreement with the United States, change from its present method
                            of controlling imports by means of prior permits and exchange rates to a
                            product quota system administered in accordance with the quota
                            provisions proposed by this Government, the United States obtaining a
                            proportional share, based on a previous representative period, of any
                            quota established. It was pointed out that if this method of import
                            control were adopted by Chile quotas could be established on any
                            product, including scheduled products if necessary to maintain the
                            exchange value of the Chilean currency.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa stated that a product quota system of this nature would
                            mean a restriction of imports of products subject to quotas from
                            countries with which Chile has compensation agreements even <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0416"/>though compensation currency should be
                            amply available to pay for such imports. He stated, however, that
                            Chile’s compensation agreement with Germany is the only obstacle to the
                            suggested method of import regulation since it would result in a
                            curtailment of Chile’s exports to Germany. In this connection he stated
                            that Chilean exports of lentils, apples and wine to Germany had
                            increased; that these are additional and not diverted exports, and that
                            the increased German demand for these products had caused artificially
                            increased production in Chile. It was pointed out to Señor Gazitúa, that
                            it is considered only fair that the control of imports be borne
                            equitably by all supplying countries.</p>
                        <p>Although indicating that, under present circumstances, he would not
                            recommend the suggested change in Chile’s import control system to his
                            Government because he was convinced his Government would not accept it,
                            Señor Gazitúa stated that Chile will eventually adopt such a system. He
                            stated that he would strongly recommend to his Government that it
                            endeavor to divert Chile’s export trade from compensation to free
                            currency countries. Señor Gazitúa said that he realized that sales
                            promotion work regarding Chilean agricultural products and manufactured
                            novelties would have to be undertaken in this country. Señor Gazitúa
                            referred to the high freight rates on Chilean shipments to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>After discussing the question of exchange availabilities, Señor Gazitúa
                            stated that Chile is doing well by United States trade now in the matter
                            of exchange. He suggested that a trade agreement contain exchange
                            provisions which would assure exchange coverage for normal United States
                            exports to Chile, and provide that additional exchange would be accorded
                            American products as it became available. This formula was objected to
                            because of its bilateral character.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa later suggested that no exchange provisions be included in
                            a trade agreement but that there be an exchange of notes, not included
                            in the agreement and unpublished, assuring United States trade all
                            exchange facilities available. The assurances contained in the proposed
                            notes would look to the eventual elimination of Chile’s compensation
                            agreements and provide that this Government, if it should not be
                            satisfied with Chile’s treatment of United States trade, could terminate
                            the agreement.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to Señor Gazitúa that, while there is no question of
                            Chile’s good intentions, his proposal would leave United States trade
                            without any assurances regarding competition from compensation
                            countries. It was also pointed out that all notes are published by this
                            Government and that any provisions providing for termination of the
                            agreement would have to be a part of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa said he would submit a draft of his proposal and was
                            informed that any proposal he wished to submit would be carefully <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0417"/>studied. He was also requested
                            to give careful consideration to our standard exchange provisions and
                            suggestions regarding the control of imports on a product quota
                            basis.</p>

                        <p>Señor Campbell called at the Department to leave a copy of the definitive
                            list of products<note n="12" xml:id="d434fn12">Not printed.</note> in
                            which the Government of Chile would be interested in securing
                            concessions in a trade agreement with the United States. The list
                            consisted of three parts (of which the first two are attached): a group
                            of items on which tariff reductions were requested (some on a seasonal
                            basis); another group on which the binding of the present tariff
                            treatment was desired; and a third list of items on which
                            most-favored-nation treatment was desired. It was explained to Mr.
                            Campbell that it was not necessary to give any consideration to the
                            third group of items as Chile would continue to receive
                            most-favored-nation treatment on such products without their being
                            specifically referred to in an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Señor Campbell was informed that consideration would be given as rapidly
                            as possible to the list which he had presented. He indicated that the
                            list had not yet been approved by his Government and that it would
                            therefore be necessary to transmit it to Santiago as soon as we had
                            expressed our opinion regarding the various items therein with respect
                            to the possibility of including them in the public announcement of
                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Chile. It was indicated
                            that it was desired to issue that announcement during the period of the
                            Panama Conference,<note n="13" xml:id="d434fn13">See <ref target="#pg_15">pp. 15</ref> ff.</note> preferably on September

                        <p>I called at the Chilean Chancery and spent about two hours discussing
                            with Señor Gazitúa and Señor Campbell the list of products which had
                            been approved by the Trade Agreements Committee for publication in
                            connection with the announcement of trade-agreement negotiations with
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to Señor Gazitúa that although no change in substance
                            in the tariff classifications of the items appearing on the list would
                            be made, it was probable that various changes of a technical nature
                            would be made in the listing of certain of the items in order to have
                            them conform to the proper legal terminology. I mentioned that this was
                            particularly true with respect to copper.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation, Señor Gazitúa raised questions
                            about various of the items which he had introduced into the
                            conversations held between August 10 and 17 and with regard to certain
                            items appearing in the list of Chilean exports to the United States
                            which had been sent to the Department several days previously. It was
                            indicated to Señor Gazitúa that the Chilean products which had been
                            considered by the trade-agreements organization prior to the formulation
                            of the list which was being handed to him today covered more than 95 or
                            96 percent of imports into the United States from Chile and included
                            practically every item of any importance at all in that trade, and while
                            in view of such extensive consideration it was not believed it would be
                            possible to include in the list for publication any additional items,
                            further study would be given to a few products, particularly certain
                            typical Chilean furs or fur skins.</p>
                        <p>In order to make every effort to issue the announcement of negotiations
                            on September 25, during the Panama Conference, Señor Gazitúa agreed to
                            cable at once to his Government the list of products handed to him and
                            endeavor to secure his Government’s approval of it as a minimum list, it
                            being understood that while, of course, there could be no assurance that
                            any other items would be added to the list, it might be possible that
                            further consideration within the next two or three days would reveal one
                            or two additional products which might be included. Señor Gazitúa also
                            agreed to ask his Government to expedite consideration of the general
                            basis for the proposed agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0419"/>
                        <p>In answer to an inquiry, Señor Gazitúa stated that he believed it would
                            be helpful if the American Embassy in Santiago were requested to assist
                            in expediting consideration by the Chilean Government of the general
                            basis and the list of products. I indicated that a telegram would be
                            sent to the Embassy along those lines. (Such a telegram was sent later
                            in the evening of September 19.)<note n="13a" xml:id="d435fn13a">

                  </p>
                        <p>It was made clear to Señor Gazitúa at various points in the conversation
                            that what we were discussing at the moment was merely the list of
                            Chilean products for publication, a procedure which was distinct from a
                            consideration of such products in connection with concessions which
                            might be granted upon them.</p>

                        <p>122. 1. In case you have not received instructions 2 and 3 of September
                                15<note n="14" xml:id="d436fn14">Neither printed.</note> referred to
                            in the Department’s telegram 118 of September 13, agreement was reached
                            with Gazitua on all important general provision questions except
                            exchange control, which was left open for discussion during the
                            negotiations on the understanding that the Chileans would be requested
                            again to accept the “standard” article. (It is understood Gazitua has
                            sent text to Santiago),<note n="15" xml:id="d436fn15">For text, see
                                telegram No. 125, September 23, 6 p.m., to the Ambassador in Chile,
                                    <ref target="#pg_412">p. 412</ref>.</note> If in the then
                            existing circumstances it were still unacceptable, it would nevertheless
                            be written into the agreement with a protocol suspending during
                            continuance of special circumstances those parts with which the Chileans
                            could not comply. Thus far Gazitua has received no indication that his
                            Government has approved the foregoing as a basis for announcement of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. Approval was given today to the list of Chilean products to be
                            published in connection with the announcement. Gazitua is now cabling
                            the list to Santiago for approval. The list, while not indicative of the
                            concessions to be granted, covers more than 95 percent of imports from
                            Chile and it is not believed the trade-agreements organization would
                            approve additional items. As you know, consideration with respect to the
                            possible granting of concessions will be limited to the items in that
                            list in the absence of later additional public announcement and
                            hearings. The list approved today covers all items requested for
                            inclusion by Gazitúa except one or two unimportant products.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>3. As it is greatly desired that Chilean negotiations be announced during
                            the Panama conference preferably September 25, it is hoped that the
                            Chilean Government will approve within the next three days the general
                            basis and list mentioned above. You should therefore keep in close touch
                            with the appropriate officials in an endeavor to expedite consideration
                            and approval.</p>

                        <p>161. We are informed that the Government is eager to accept the basis for
                            negotiations but that it cannot reach a decision without definite
                            information regarding the suspension feature in the protocol. It
                            definitely indicated that it cannot accept the standard exchange article
                            under conditions imposed by the war today and that Gazitua is instructed
                            to send definite information on the protocol. With the major German
                            trade definitely lost the standard article would jeopardize the
                            remaining trade with the other compensation countries. We are agreed
                            here that their point of view is reasonable if not inevitable. Please
                            provide Gazitua and this Embassy with details on proposed protocol.</p>

                        <p>126. Your 161, September 25, 1 p.m. Basis for a protocol suspending
                            certain features of “standard” article in the event of Chilean inability
                            to comply fully therewith at time of negotiations, will be found in
                            memorandum of conversation with Gazitua of September 9,<note n="19" xml:id="d440fn19">Not found in Department files.</note> enclosed
                            with instruction no. 2 of September 15.<note n="20" xml:id="d440fn20">Not printed.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>Point 2 of that basis would refer probably to Chilean inability to supply
                            exchange without delay for all imports from the United States, if it
                            were found impossible to use quotas as the sole means of controlling
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>A definite answer cannot be given on point 4 at present, as this will
                            naturally depend on the outlook at the time of negotiations, but you may
                            assure the Chileans in strict confidence that we are disposed to take
                            fully and sympathetically into account their economic position at that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Other points would not seem to require comment.</p>

                        <p>Señor Gazitua called by appointment to discuss the question of announcing
                            negotiations for a trade agreement between the United States and Chile.
                            He was informed that subject to final approval by the Secretary, which
                            it was anticipated would be received shortly, we were now prepared to
                            issue the announcement at any time.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua referred to the fact that he had received instructions from
                            his Government on two points: that agreement should not be given by him
                            to the announcement of trade-agreement negotiations until this
                            Government had given assurances that the Compañía Sudamericana de
                            Vapores would be admitted to the West Coast steamship conference; and
                            that lemons would be included in the list of products to be considered
                            by the United States in connection with the agreement. On the latter
                            point Señor Gazitua indicated that he had received later instructions
                            that his Government would not insist upon including lemons in the
                            published list, but that his original instructions had not been changed
                            on the first point.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out to Señor Gazitua with respect to the shipping matter,
                            that this was a question entirely distinct from that of the trade
                            agreement and as far as this Government was concerned the issuance of
                            the trade-agreement announcement could not be made contingent upon a
                            solution of the shipping problem. It was indicated also that the Chilean
                            steamship line had only made application to the conference under its
                            current proposal on September 15; that the conference had agreed to hold
                            hearings on or about October 3, which was relatively prompt action; that
                            the Maritime Commission could not enter the picture until the conference
                            had acted on the Chilean application; and that the Department would
                            continue as it had in the past to suggest to the Maritime Commission the
                            desirability of prompt and thorough consideration of the Chilean case.
                            In the meantime, it was not believed that the Department could take any
                            further action. It was further indicated <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0423"/>to Señor Gazitua that the Maritime Commission was an
                            independent Government agency operating under its own legislation and it
                            would not be appropriate for the Department to attempt to exert any
                            pressure on the Commission.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua stated that in view of the foregoing he did not see that
                            there was anything further that he could do for the moment regarding the
                            trade-agreement announcement as he did not wish to take the
                            responsibility, in view of the instructions from his Government, of
                            agreeing to the announcement without assurances on the shipping matter.
                            He indicated that he might possibly receive further instructions from
                            Santiago, and in the meantime he would attempt to secure advance
                            assurances of favorable action by the conference on the shipping matter
                            from one of the officials of that group. If such assurances could not be
                            secured, the trade-agreement announcement would have to be delayed at
                            least until after the hearing by the shipping conference the early part
                            of next week.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua was told that he would be informed of the Secretary’s
                            decision on the trade-agreement announcement as soon as that had been
                            received.</p>

                        <p>166. Referring to the Department’s No. 126, September 25, 8 p.m. Ortega
                            has just promised to prepare this afternoon a statement for the press
                            accepting our offers for the trade agreement which statement he hopes to
                            deliver to me after discussing its wording sometime between 7 and 9
                            o’clock this evening. The announcement of intention to negotiate could
                            then be given to the press simultaneously at Santiago, Panama, and
                            Washington during the night or tomorrow morning.</p>
                        <p>If Department desires announcement thus expedited I suggest that
                            arrangements be made for action upon a telegram from this Embassy this
                            evening although past experience indicates the possibility that some
                            delay may yet arise.</p>
                        <p>Ortega’s acceptance is based upon his understanding that the Department
                            will definitely use its best efforts to secure the admission of the Cía.
                            Sudamericana de Vapores to the steamship conference; and it would be
                            well for the Department to confirm this understanding at the earliest
                            possible moment.</p>

                        <p>128. Your 166, September 30, 2 p.m. It is not possible for us now to get
                            an announcement to the press for Sunday’s papers. The earliest
                            practicable time for announcement would therefore be Monday forenoon,
                            for immediate release. In order to clear the way as promptly as possible
                            for simultaneous announcement here, at <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0425"/>Santiago, and at Panama Monday morning, it is suggested
                            that you telegraph Ortega’s proposed statement in order that we may send
                            you a reply Sunday. If it is too lengthy to telegraph in full, please
                            telegraph a summary with full quotations of any passages bearing upon
                            the two following points.</p>
                        <p>As you know, it is a cardinal point in our procedure that no binding
                            commitments are made regarding our tariff rates prior to our public
                            hearings following announcement of intention to negotiate. It is
                            therefore important that the Chilean announcement contain no statement
                            or implication which might seem to indicate that any such commitments
                            have been made. Of course they have not in fact been made.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean announcement should also not contain any statement or
                            implication to the effect that the question of admitting the C. S. A.
                                V.<note n="25" xml:id="d444fn25">Compañía Sudamericana de
                                Vapores.</note> to the steamship conference has been made the
                            subject of any understanding or commitment in connection with the
                            announcement of trade agreement negotiations. Gazitúa was informed
                            Wednesday that this shipping matter is a question entirely distinct from
                            the question of trade agreement negotiations, and that so far as we are
                            concerned the announcement of trade agreement negotiations cannot be
                            made contingent upon a solution of the shipping question.</p>
                        <p>We have as a matter of fact facilitated Gazitúa’s direct contact with the
                            Maritime Commission in connection with this shipping question. The C. S.
                            A. V. presented its current application to the conference only on
                            September 15. The conference has scheduled hearings for Monday or
                            Tuesday, which is prompt action in the circumstances. If the conference
                            should reject the application, the Commission would then be in a
                            position to review the case, but until the conference has acted the
                            Commission is not in a position to take action. Gazitúa was informed
                            that in that event the Department would urge upon the Commission the
                            desirability of prompt and full consideration of the case, but that it
                            would not be appropriate for the Department to attempt to exert pressure
                            upon an independent Government agency.</p>

                            Washington was reserved for Department and Under Secretary Welles.
                            Announcement here in this morning’s local press is relatively brief,
                            inconspicuous and discreet and does not refer in any way to shipping
                            conference problem. It does not mention list of articles for tariff
                            concessions or imply any commitment by the United States either
                            specifically or generally, merely indicating that Chile’s sales in the
                            United States of products formerly sent to Europe should be increased
                            and hinting that intention to negotiate shows good relations between the
                            United States and Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>Ortega has gone to the country for the week end and could not recall
                            release to press here already used as outlined above. I am asking
                            American and other news agencies at Santiago not to use story but to
                            have their office at Washington and Panama consult with the Department
                            and delegation regarding it.</p>

                        <p>Señor Gazitua called by appointment at Mr. Duggan’s office to discuss
                            difficulties in connection with the announcement of trade-agreement
                            negotiations between the United States and Chile, which had risen as a
                            result of a request by the Chilean Government that the Department give
                            assurances regarding the admission of the Compañía Sudamericana de
                            Vapores to the West Coast shipping conference as a condition to assent
                            by that Government to the announcement of trade-agreement
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The above question was discussed both in general and in relation to the
                            time at which trade-agreement negotiations might be announced. With
                            respect to the general question, Señor Gazitúa read in translation
                            telegrams exchanged between him and his Government on the matter, as a
                            result of which it was pointed out to him that <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0427"/>he appeared in his messages to his
                            Government to have gone beyond the statements which had been made to him
                            during the past few days by various officers of the Department. It was
                            again indicated clearly to Señor Gazitua that the matter was one which
                            had to be settled in the first instance by the steamship lines
                            concerned; that if the shipping conference at the hearings scheduled for
                            October 3 rejected the application of the Chilean line for admission,
                            the Maritime Commission would only then be in a position to review the
                            case and any action by the Department would necessarily be limited to an
                            expression of interest in the case and a request that the Commission
                            expedite consideration of the matter.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that there appeared to be some doubt that the Chilean
                            Government had received an accurate indication of the Department’s
                            position in the shipping matter, the suggestion was made that perhaps an
                                <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> or memorandum might be prepared
                            setting forth correctly the Department’s position and that this might be
                            initialed by both Señor Gazitúa and officers of the Department. (It was
                            decided later, however, to have the matter cleared with the Chilean
                            Government through our Embassy in Santiago.)</p>
                        <p>With respect to the immediate question of the time of the announcement
                            once a definite understanding had been reached with the Chilean
                            Government on the shipping matter and its relation to the announcement
                            of the trade-agreement negotiations, it was agreed that the announcement
                            would have to be delayed until the shipping matter was settled.</p>

                        <p>130. Your 168, October 1, 11 a.m. After further discussion with Gazitua
                            this morning we still have some doubt as to how accurately the Chilean
                            Government understands our position regarding the shipping conference
                            question. In view of your 166, September 30, 2 p.m. and 167, September
                            30, 10 p.m., it is essential to be assured of mutual understanding on
                            this point before we issue our announcement of trade agreement
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly please present the following statement in writing to the
                            appropriate Chilean authorities with a view to obtaining such assurance:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As the Chilean Embassy here states that it has informed its
                                    Government, there is no link whatsoever between the shipping
                                    conference matter and the announcement of trade agreement
                                    negotiations. Our position is that on the shipping matter we are
                                    strictly limited to the expression of informal interest to the
                                    Maritime Commission with a <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0428"/>view to expediting the Commission’s
                                    consideration in accordance with its usual procedure. The
                                    Commission would be in a position to act only if the conference
                                    should reject the application. Since the Commission is an
                                    independent semi-judicial agency, the Department’s action would
                                    have to be strictly limited to urging upon the Commission the
                                    desirability of prompt and full consideration of the case; it
                                    would not be appropriate or helpful for the Department to exert
                                    pressure to influence the Maritime Commission’s ultimate
                                    decision.”</p>

                            endeavor to clear this matter as speedily as possible since we must
                            withhold our announcement until we receive a reply indicating full

                            particularly in view of the announcement already made at Santiago,

                        <p>Señor Gazitua and Señor Campbell called by appointment to discuss in a
                            preliminary way the procedure to be followed for the negotiation of the
                            proposed trade agreement between the United States and Chile, now that
                            the announcement of intention to negotiate had been issued on October
                            2.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins pointed out that it was our desire that the negotiations for
                            the proposed agreement be conducted in Washington, indicating that with
                            negotiations with other countries in prospect it would not be feasible
                            for the Department to send any representative to Santiago in the near
                            future to assist in the Chilean negotiations. Mr. Hawkins also mentioned
                            the desirability of proceeding as rapidly as possible with work on the
                            general provisions, with the exception of the exchange and quota
                            articles, which would by mutual agreement be left open for discussion at
                            a later date.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua indicated that he believed it would be agreeable to his
                            Government to have the negotiations take place in Washington as he had
                            already been authorized to carry on the discussions here up to the
                            present time. With respect to the discussion of the general provisions,
                            he agreed that it would be desirable to proceed immediately with these
                            questions but requested that the Department ask our Embassy in Santiago
                            to request the Chilean Foreign Office to expedite consideration of the
                            preliminary text of provisions which he had transmitted to his
                            Government in August but regarding which he had not yet received any
                            reaction. It was agreed that such an instruction would be sent to the
                            American Embassy in Santiago.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua raised again a question which he had brought up at a
                            previous meeting, namely, the procedure followed in the United States by
                            the Treasury Department in determining the dutiable value of imports on
                            which duties are levied on an ad valorem basis. He pointed out that in
                            the case of melons imported from Chile it appeared that the Treasury
                            Department was doing two things which it was felt were unfavorable to
                            Chilean exports of that commodity: there was being utilized as the rate
                            for converting Chilean to United States currency the “official” Chilean
                            exchange rate of 19.37 pesos to the dollar, a rate which was not used in
                            Chile for general commercial purposes; and the selling price in the
                            United States of melons imported from Chile was being taken as a basis
                            for the assessment of ad valorem duties rather than the f. o. b. price
                            in Chile. Señor Gazitua pointed out that, in his opinion, the rate for
                            converting currencies for customs purposes which should be used was the
                            so-called export draft rate of 25 pesos to the dollar. Señor Gazitua was
                            informed that within the next few days an officer of the Treasury
                            Department would be invited <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0430"/>to
                            discuss with him at the Department the practices followed by the
                            Treasury Department in the two matters mentioned above and the reasons
                            therefor.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua also raised a question as to the exact nature of the
                            product which had been listed in connection with the public announcement
                            of intention to negotiate as spermaceti wax, and it was agreed that he
                            would be furnished with information on this question.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Counselor also raised certain specific points regarding the
                            classification for customs purposes in this country of peas and beans
                            imported from Chile and he was informed that we would be glad to discuss
                            this and similar questions with him when our technical studies had
                            advanced sufficiently.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitua mentioned that consideration was being given by his
                            Government to the tentative list of products on which this Government
                            might be interested in securing concessions in the trade agreement, and
                            he indicated that his Government was giving favorable consideration to a
                            number of these, including products the duty on which was so high as to
                            encourage a great deal of smuggling into Chile.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Chilean representatives would be supplied within
                            the next few days with a copy of the current text of the “standard”
                            general provisions and that it would be desirable as a means of
                            expediting consideration by their Government of the general provisions
                            if each article were to be translated and submitted to their Government
                            as soon as agreement had been reached here with respect thereto.</p>

                            telegram no. 131 of October 2, 1939, 7 p.m., announcement of intention
                            to negotiate a reciprocal trade agreement with Chile was issued during
                            the evening of October 2 for use in newspapers appearing the following
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>Since that date a conversation has been held by officers of the

                            the negotiations be conducted in Washington. Due to the necessity of
                            sending officers of the Department abroad to assist in the negotiation

                            desirability of providing the Chilean Embassy as soon as possible with
                            their comments on the general provisions of the agreement on which it is
                            understood Señor Gazitua submitted a report to his Government in August.
                            It is desired to utilize the next few weeks for discussion of those

                            quota articles, as definitive negotiations cannot take place with

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 22 of October 11, 1939, with reference to
                            the consideration by the Chilean Government of the general provisions of
                            the projected Chilean-American trade agreement, on which it is
                            understood that the Counselor of the Chilean Embassy at Washington
                            submitted a report to his Government in August.</p>
                        <p>On consultation with Señor Cayetano Vigar, Chilean Under Secretary of
                            Commerce, it is learned that the latter has now received a copy of the
                            current text of the “standard” general provisions. He has undertaken to
                            study these at once, omitting the provisions respecting exchange and
                            quotas, and he hopes to transmit his comments to the Chilean Embassy at
                            Washington within the next week or so if possible. It is assumed that
                            the general provisions as reported by Señor Gazitúa in August have now
                            been superseded, so that comments on the revised provisions will be more
                            suitable. In connection with approving the announcement of intention to
                            negotiate the agreement the Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            indicated to Mr. Frost on September 30th a general acceptance of the
                            provisions proposed <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0432"/>by Señor
                            Gazitúa; but this attitude was not based upon any detailed study here,
                            and the latter is now being made by Under Secretary Vigar.</p>
                        <p>Señor Vigar raised no objections in respect to the Department’s intention
                            of negotiating the agreement at Washington, and appeared to understand
                            the difficulties which the Department would encounter in detailing
                            officers to Santiago in order to pursue the negotiations here. It is
                            believed, however, that he plans to follow the course of the discussions
                            rather closely; and if this Embassy can be of service at any time I
                            should of course be glad to receive instructions. A copy of the current
                            text of the standard general provisions might perhaps be helpful to the
                            Embassy, and is presumably being forwarded by the Department.</p>
                        <p>It may be of interest to report that Señor Vigar, while appreciating the
                            value of the trade agreement, does not anticipate that a sufficient
                            volume of Chilean agricultural exports to the United States can be built
                            up to correct radically the Chilean shortage of international exchange.
                            He referred to the relative smallness of the fruit trade, and to the
                            fact that dried vegetables have not been needed in large quantities by
                            the United States; and he also volunteered the statement that it can
                            hardly be expected that the United States will take Chilean copper in
                            quantities sufficient to affect adversely the American copper industry.
                            His mind is still running on the necessity of promoting industries
                            within Chile which will obviate certain of her imports of manufactured
                            goods; and he spoke particularly of ship-building in this connection. He
                            feels that it will be difficult for Chile to purchase new vessel tonnage
                            abroad at prices which she can afford; while she already possesses a
                            rudimentary ship-building industry, with many of the elements which
                            could justify its expansion. It appeared that he has not yet held
                            extensive conversations with Señores García and Pedregal of the Fomento
                            Corporation, since his return; but he apparently plans to advocate
                            industrial developments, as indicated, in early discussions with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I shall endeavor to keep in contact with Señor Vigar to ensure his prompt
                            submission to the Chilean Embassy at Washington of the comments desired
                            by the Department, and will report from time to time as the situation
                            develops.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the conversations being
                            conducted here looking toward the negotiation of a reciprocal trade
                            agreement between <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0433"/>the United
                            States and Chile, it now appears that it will not be possible to hand
                            definitive proposals on the two Schedules to the Chilean representative
                            in Washington earlier than about December 6 or 7. As nearly a week will
                            be required for these proposals to reach the Chilean Government if they
                            are transmitted by air mail, it will probably be necessary, in view of
                            the time element discussed later, to send them to Santiago by telegraph.
                            As it is believed that telegraphic communication can be more
                            expeditiously handled through the Department than through the Chilean
                            Embassy in Washington, our definitive proposals on the Schedules will be
                            telegraphed to you as soon as they have been handed to the Chilean
                            representative here, and you will be requested to transmit them to the
                            appropriate officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as quickly as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the general provisions of the proposed agreement, the
                            Chilean Embassy has already transmitted this Government’s proposals on
                            all of the twenty articles, together with a Spanish translation of those
                            articles made by the Chilean Embassy which had previously been submitted
                            for the Department’s comment.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed for the Embassy’s information a text in English and
                            Spanish of the twenty articles proposed by this Government.<note n="30" xml:id="d453fn30">Not attached to file copy.</note> A comparison of
                            this text with the mimeographed text of the “standard” provisions
                            transmitted with the Department’s instruction no. 26 of October 24,
                                1939,<note n="31" xml:id="d453fn31">Not printed.</note> will reveal
                            a few changes, particularly in Articles I, VII and XX. With respect to
                            the last sentence in Article VII, this was inserted at the request of
                            the Chilean representative and has not yet been submitted to the Trade
                            Agreements Committee. Article XX has been drafted with existing Chilean
                            practice in mind, and would require that the agreement be ratified by
                            the Chilean Congress within one year from the date of its provisional
                            entry into force. The inclusion of the clause in parenthesis in Article
                            XII is conditional upon acceptance by the Chilean Government of Article
                            IV in the form proposed by this Government.</p>
                        <p>There is also enclosed a draft headnote<note n="31" xml:id="d453fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> in English and Spanish for Schedule I, which may be
                            used in the proposed agreement. It will be noted that this is similar to
                            the headnote which may be used for Schedule II, with appropriate change
                            for the name of the country.</p>
                        <p>In case it should be found necessary during the next few weeks to
                            communicate with the Embassy by telegraph regarding the general
                            provisions, reference will be made to the enclosed text and not to the
                            mimeographed version. As of interest to the Embassy there is also
                            enclosed a copy of the informal memorandum handed the Counselor of the
                            Chilean Embassy on November 25<note n="31" xml:id="d453fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> regarding Articles III, <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0434"/>IV and XII of the proposed agreement, a translation of
                            which Señor Gazitua has already sent to his Government.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the proposed agreement in general, it is considered
                            essential by the Department that signature take place by January 1,
                            1940. It is desired, therefore, that you stress with the appropriate
                            Chilean officials the desirability of proceeding as rapidly as possible
                            at this time with consideration of the general provisions, and later, of
                            our proposals on the schedules.</p>

                            action in the trade agreement negotiations will not prejudice the plans
                            he may have made in this respect. This Government would be very pleased
                            to have Señor Wachholtz come to the United States for conclusion of the
                            agreement if he should find it practicable to do so.</p>
                        <p>Our definitive proposals on the schedules should be in the hands of the
                            Chilean Embassy by December 9 and will also be telegraphed to you by
                            that date, in accordance with instruction no. 48. The proposals on the
                            general provisions have been in the hands of the Chileans for some time.
                            Every effort has been made to grant the fullest concessions possible in
                            order to facilitate the Chilean action upon which the negotiations will
                            then be dependent.</p>
                        <p>The situation with respect to the possibility of further financial
                            assistance to Chile remains the same as stated under point (2) of the
                            Department’s telegram no. 140 of October 14, and it likewise continues
                            to be undesirable that there be any publicity which might prejudice
                            congressional action on the program of financial cooperation.</p>

                            agreement:</p>

                        <p>The foregoing offer was also made subject to the condition that this

                            grapes and modify the seasonal period.</p>
                        <p>The descriptions of the products listed above are not in the exact form
                            in which they will appear in the agreement, but changes will not affect
                            the substance of any concession offered.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information, bindings may be offered on the
                            following products if the Chileans insist:</p>

                            included in the original offers because of Chile’s minor importance as a
                            supplier.</p>
                        <p>A reduction in the tax on copper definitely cannot be granted.</p>
                        <p>The above items cover all those appearing in the public notice of October
                            2 except pears, which had been rejected as a concession for <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0436"/>Argentina, a much more important
                            supplier than Chile, onions, on which no concession was possible on
                            account of a crop surplus here and purchases of excess stocks by the
                            Surplus Commodity Corporation, and beans, which are discussed below.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing offers are subject, of course, to Chilean acceptance of our
                            Schedule I requests, which will be sent you shortly, and to agreement
                            upon the general provisions.</p>
                        <p>The Department transmitted to you by pouch on December 6 the text of the
                            note proposed for presentation to the Chilean Ambassador containing our
                            Schedule Two proposals, which included an offer on beans. Subsequently
                            the Trade Agreements Committee reconsidered that offer and voted that it
                            should not be proposed to the Chileans. In transmitting the proposals
                            outlined above to the Chileans, therefore, you should omit beans. If
                            asked to explain the absence of that item, give the same reason as noted
                            above for onions.</p>
                        <p>Please convey the appropriate parts of the foregoing to the Chilean
                            officials as soon as possible, stressing most strongly the need for
                            expeditious consideration of our proposals, both those above and on the
                            general provisions. Please keep the Department currently informed by
                            telegraph of developments.</p>

                            Government on October 2, 1939 a public notice of intention to negotiate
                            such an agreement, together with an accompanying list of products on
                            which the United States would consider the granting of concessions, the

                            importation <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0438"/>into Chile,
                            concerning which a memorandum is also enclosed.<note n="35" xml:id="d457fn35">Not printed, but see telegram No. 164, December 9,

                                428</ref>.</note> The offers of the United States set forth in the
                            attached memorandum are, of course, contingent upon agreement being
                            reached on the general provisions to be included in the trade agreement,
                            which are now the subject of discussions between representatives of our
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>In setting forth the concessions which my Government is prepared to grant
                            to facilitate the importation of Chilean products into the United
                            States, full account has been taken of the desirability of bringing the
                            present negotiations to an early conclusion. The concessions offered,
                            therefore, represent the maximum which my Government finds itself in a
                            position to grant. Likewise, in preparing the list of United States
                            products upon which concessions are requested of Your Excellency’s
                            Government, every effort has been made to restrict the requests therein
                            to a minimum which can be accepted by the Chilean Government without
                            difficulty or undue delay, and which will represent a fair equivalent
                            for the benefits offered for Chilean products.</p>

                        <p>Señor Gazitúa called on the Assistant Secretary by appointment, to
                            receive the proposals on Schedules I and II which had been formulated by
                            this Government for the proposed trade agreement between the United
                            States and Chile.</p>
                        <p>In giving the proposals to Señor Gazitúa, Mr. Grady noted that copper had
                            not been included in Schedule II for the principal reason that the
                            trade-agreements organization, after a very thorough study of the
                            subject, had come to the conclusion that a reduction in the import tax
                            to the extent permitted in a trade agreement would be of little value to
                            the Chilean Government. Señor Gazitúa admitted that his Government had
                            not, in the original stages of the conversations, placed particular
                            emphasis on copper, but stated that in view of the extreme opposition
                            which had developed in the United States against any concession on
                            copper and the considerable comment which had appeared in the Chilean
                            press, his Government might feel it necessary to explain why that item
                            would not appear in the proposed trade agreement. <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0439"/>Mr. Grady suggested that we might be
                            able to supply Señor Gazitúa with some information for such an
                            explanation.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa noted particularly the absence of dried beans and onions
                            from the list of products on which the United States was prepared to
                            offer concessions and stated that he believed his Government would find
                            it extremely difficult to conclude an agreement which did not contain
                            concessions on those products. Señor Gazitúa was assured that onions and
                            beans had been the subject of thorough investigation by the
                            trade-agreements organization and it was finally concluded that, in view
                            of the existing domestic situation of crop surpluses and purchases by
                            the Federal Surplus Commodity Corporation of excess stocks, no
                            concessions could be offered.</p>
                        <p>Upon leaving Mr. Grady’s office the conversation was continued in the
                            Trade Agreements Division and Señor Gazitúa was supplied with
                            statistical information on those products appearing in the published
                            list of October 2 which had not been included among those on which
                            concessions had been offered by the United States. Señor Gazitúa stated
                            that he would transmit the proposals to his Government by airmail on
                            December 11 and he was informed that, in accordance with a previous oral
                            understanding, the lists of concessions offered and requested by this
                            Government were being sent to our Embassy in Santiago for expeditious
                            presentation to the Chilean Government.</p>

                        <p>221. Department’s numbers 163 and 164, December 9, 1 p.m. Estimates here
                            indicate that the Department is offering reductions on Chilean exports
                            to the United States whose value in 1938 was between 200 and 250,000
                            dollars. Moreover Chile’s production and exports of the products is not
                            susceptible of great expansion. In other words the offer is so
                            restricted as to have little value. On the other hand the reductions
                            sought for American products sold to Chile affect some 3 to 3½ million
                            dollars worth of trade.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the submission of such a proposal is not only likely to be
                            rejected but our Good Neighbor policy toward Chile is certain to be
                            seriously discounted, unless we offer Chile concessions on red kidney
                            beans, onions, bulk wine, et cetera, and at the same time greatly reduce
                            our requests from it in our Schedule I.</p>
                        <p>We are actually asking Chile to give up in customs revenue more than the
                            total value of the trade on which we are making reductions which is less
                            than 1 percent of Chile’s exports to the United States. <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0440"/>If we cannot make further concessions
                            as above suggested and reduce our demands the postponement of
                            negotiations indefinitely on some pretext or other would probably do
                            less damage to us here. Request instructions.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Because I am genuinely
                            alarmed over the nature of the trade agreement proposals to be made by
                            us to Chile I have thought it my duty to write personally to Secretary
                            Hull setting forth the very strong and unanimous conviction, not only of
                            myself, but of Mr. Frost, the Counselor, Mr. Bohan, the Commercial
                            Attaché, and Mr. Trueblood, the Second Secretary. In fact there is not
                            one man in the Embassy who does not share the views therein expressed.
                            We are offering precious little to a country that needs help, but that
                            would not be bad if we ourselves were asking proportionately little, but
                            the contrary is the fact.</p>
                        <p>We have great investments here, and looking to the future, we are afraid
                            that unless we are able to do something more for Chile than the meager
                            $5,000,000 credits there may be a reaction which will change the feeling
                            for us here. And there is grave danger that from sheer desperation and
                            necessity she may be forced to suspend payment on the American debt to
                            get the dollars to buy in America the things she needs.</p>
                        <p>You will note from the letter what the British are doing.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry you got the wrong impression about the Alessandri matter.<note n="36" xml:id="d460fn36">On his return to Chile from a European
                                trip, ex-President Arturo Alessandri stopped in the United States
                                and was received by President Roosevelt and other high officials,
                                including the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary of State,
                                but no public statements were made by them.</note> It never occurred
                            to me that he should not be received. In view of his action in sending
                            to the anti-Government press here complimentary things said, not for
                            publication, by Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles, I had no doubt it was my duty
                            to warn Washington of what had been done to the end that you might not
                            say anything to him as a matter of cordiality that could be used by the
                            opposition press as an implied expression of a preference for the former
                            Government.</p>

                                    the concessions offered on some products of my country represent
                                    the maximum which Your Excellency’s Government finds itself in a
                                    position to grant, and that the tariff concessions requested on
                                    certain products of the United States have been restricted to a
                                    minimum, which could be accepted by my Government without
                                    difficulty or delay. You also state that such concessions on
                                    products of the United States represent a fair equivalent for
                                    the benefits offered to certain Chilean products.—</item>

                                <item>—Commercial relations between Chile and the United States,
                                        although very cordial, have been suffering from various
                                        obstacles in the last few years, due to the scarcity of
                                        foreign exchange<note n="37" xml:id="d461fn37">See <ref target="frus1937v05#pg_430">

                                        available in Chile to cover the cost of the articles which
                                        exporters of the United States have desired to send into
                                        Chile.—</item>
                                    <label/><item>This lack of exchange has its origin in the balance of
                                        payments between the two nations, which is decisively
                                        favorable to the United States.—

                                <item>—One of the most effective means for solving the problem of
                                    the scarcity of exchange in Chile, is the increase of Chilean
                                    exports to the United States. Approximately 90% of Chilean
                                    imports come in here free of duty, and consist of fertilizers,
                                    iodine, iron ores, sulphur and other products in minor
                                    quantities. The balance of 10% represents agriculture products,
                                    which are harvested in Chile at seasons opposite to those in the
                                    United States. As is natural, in negotiating a Trade Agreement
                                    with the United States, my Government must of necessity request
                                    tariff concessions on these latter products subject to duties.
                                    From this derives the interest with which I awaited the decision
                                    on the tariff concessions asked by this Embassy, and which were
                                    transmitted to me in Your Excellency’s note of the 9th,
                                    instant.—</item>

                                <item>—Having thoroughly studied these concessions, as well as the
                                    concessions which Your Excellency’s Government has requested on
                                    some products of the United States, it would seem that the Trade
                                    Agreement under discussion does not have as its main purpose the
                                    improvement of the balance of payments between the two nations.
                                    In this connection I should like to call attention to some data
                                    which it is felt should be taken into consideration in the
                                    current negotiations: <list>
                                        <item>First. Due to the nature of the products and to
                                            reasons of competition with similar domestic articles,
                                            exports from the United States to Chile have increased
                                            steadily during the last few years notwithstanding the
                                            lack of exchange available in Chile, while Chilean
                                            exports to the United States diminished in almost 40%
                                            during 1938 as compared with the preceding year.—</item>
                                        <item>Second.—If we analyze imports of Chilean articles in
                                            the United States for which tariff concessions are
                                            offered and compare them with exports of United States
                                            goods to Chile for which tariff concessions are asked,
                                            it may be well noted that while the former amounted to
                                            $239,000 in 1928 [<hi rend="italic">1938?</hi>] the
                                            latter amounted to $1,794,000, not in 1938, but in 1937,
                                            when exports of United States articles to Chile had less
                                            value than in 1938.—</item>
                                        <item>Third.—That in the event such exports from Chile for
                                            which tariff concessions are offered are doubled, which
                                            does not seem probable, the value of such doubled
                                            exports would amount to only 27% of the normal annual
                                            exportation to Chile of articles from the United States
                                            for which tariff concessions are requested.—</item>
                                    </list>
                        </item>

                                <item>—For the reasons pointed out, and taking into account the
                                    difficulty of obtaining any improvement in the balance of
                                    payments between the two countries unless substantial tariff
                                    concessions are considered for those products which Chile
                                    exports to the United States subject to duties, I beg leave to
                                    request that Your Excellency be good enough to use your good

                        <p>Señor Gazitúa called to discuss certain questions in connection with the
                            general provisions of the proposed trade agreement, concerning which he
                            had received cabled instructions from his Government.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Article I, on most-favored-nation treatment, the proposal
                            of the Chilean Government was for the use of the formula developed by
                            the League of Nations on this subject.<note n="40" xml:id="d464fn40">League of Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official Journal</hi>, Special
                                Supplement No. 138, p. 128.</note> Señor Gazitúa was informed that
                            his Government’s proposal was acceptable in principle, subject to a
                            close examination of the actual language of the League of Nations’
                            formula in relation to that proposed by this Government, but it was
                            believed that the final clause of the League of Nations’ formula, on
                            exceptions for frontier traffic and customs unions, should remain in
                            Article XVI with other exceptions, as set forth in the draft proposed by
                            this Government.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Article V, on monopolies, the Chilean Government
                            expressed a desire that this be eliminated from the proposed agreement.
                            It was indicated to Señor Gazitúa that we wish to retain this Article,
                            and before considering its elimination, we would wish to know the
                            reasons why the Chilean Government desired to have it dropped.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government also desired to eliminate Article IX of the
                            proposed draft which provides specifically that the schedules annexed to
                            the agreement and the notes included in them will be considered as
                            integral parts of the agreement. It was indicated to Señor Gazitúa that
                            we might eliminate Article IX provided the appropriate changes were made
                            in Articles VII and VIII to the effect that the schedules were to be
                            considered parts of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>In Article XIV, the general safeguard provision, the Chilean Government
                            desired to have a thirty day escape clause inserted. Señor <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0445"/>Gazitúa was informed that such a
                            proposal would be acceptable to this Government and that appropriate
                            changes should be made in the first and third paragraphs of Article
                            XX.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa stated that his Government desired to have Article XVI
                            broadened to include exceptions to most-favored-nation treatment in
                            connection with trade between Chile and its contiguous countries (Peru,
                            Bolivia and Argentina). He was informed that this Government was opposed
                            in principle to such exceptions to most-favored-nation treatment, that
                            the Cuban exception on our side was a special case based on historical
                            considerations and was much less comprehensive than the Chilean proposal
                            respecting contiguous countries, that it would be to Chile’s
                            disadvantage if the United States were to permit exceptions in the case
                            of Canada and Mexico, (which we would not in any case desire), and
                            finally that in view of the fact that various countries with which Chile
                            has treaties or agreements do not reciprocate in the matter of
                            exceptions of contiguous countries, the exception proposed by Chile
                            would have little practical significance. On the basis of the foregoing,
                            this Government could not agree to the Chilean proposal.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the third paragraph of Article XVII, respecting the
                            constitutional limitations on the authority of the Federal Government in
                            the United States with respect to the sale, taxation or use of imported
                            articles, the proposal of the Chilean Government was to make this
                            provision reciprocal. It was indicated to Señor Gazitúa that there would
                            be no objection to this proposal.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa pointed out with respect to Article XX, the termination
                            provisions, that his Government had stated that only the schedules and
                            the related general provisions could be put into effect provisionally,
                            the entry into force of the remaining general provisions being subject
                            to ratification by the Chilean Congress. It was suggested to Señor
                            Gazitúa that he inquire of his Government whether it was believed
                            possible that the agreement could be ratified by the Chilean Congress
                            within thirty days following signature, and if so that the provisions of
                            Article XX be drafted so as to provide for the entry into force of the
                            entire agreement on that basis. If it should develop that Congressional
                            ratification could not be secured within thirty days then the suggestion
                            was made that the schedules and related general provisions be put into
                            effect provisionally thirty days after signature and the remainder of
                            the agreement following exchange of the instruments of proclamation by
                            the President of the United States and of ratification by the Chilean
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Señor Gazitúa said that he would send a cable immediately to his
                            Government conveying the foregoing information.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Claude</hi>: I have received your letter of
                                December 13. In regard to the trade agreement proposals, it seems to
                                me from information furnished by the State Department that you may
                                not have taken sufficiently into account in your appraisal of the
                                situation that in an arrangement of this kind the binding of duties
                                may be of as much or greater importance than duty reductions from a
                                long-range viewpoint. I am told that on the basis of both duty
                                bindings and reductions, our proposals cover 55 percent of our
                                imports from Chile <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0447"/>in 1938,
                                whereas our requests cover only 39 percent of Chilean imports from
                                this country. One of the bindings which we offered was on nitrate,
                                and we were able to make this offer only after considerable
                                discussion necessitated by certain views expressed by the War
                                Department. Your computation does not seem to give weight to the
                                importance of this concession to Chile.</p>
                            <p>I agree that on the whole, the concessions we are now able to offer
                                leave something to be desired. It must be kept in mind, however,
                                that we are facing bitter opposition to the continuance of the
                                trade-agreements program which will come to a head when the Trade
                                Agreements Act comes up for renewal at the next session of Congress.
                                In these circumstances, it is necessary to proceed with caution.</p>
                            <p>With regard to our requests for tariff concessions from Chile, it may
                                be that these can properly be regarded as excessive, but it must be
                                borne in mind that in formulating our requests, we naturally must
                                indicate what would serve our interest. If the Chilean Government
                                considers them unreasonable and will indicate the ground on which it
                                finds them so, we will, of course, be glad to reconsider them.</p>
                            <p>We are hopeful that Pedregal can present specific proposals for the
                                proper utilization of the $5,000,000 credit, for the mutual benefit
                                of both countries. As yet, however, there seems to be little of a
                                concrete nature to report. I have asked the State Department to keep
                                you currently informed.</p>
                            <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that I arrived in Santiago by plane returning from the United States on
                            Tuesday, February 21st last. This morning, having had an appointment to
                            visit the Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="44" xml:id="d467fn44">Abraham Ortega.</note> for the purpose of signing and exchanging
                            notes prolonging the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>,<note n="45" xml:id="d467fn45">See <ref target="#pg_403">pp. 403</ref> ff.</note>
                            he raised the question of my visit to Washington and I took the occasion
                            to explain to him briefly the situation at the time I left: which was to
                            the effect that the charter of the Export-Import Bank having been due to
                            expire <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0448"/>in June next the
                            question of its extension was then before Congress and until this had
                            been decided and the exact terms of the new or revised charter were
                            known, it would be impossible to give any definite reply to the Chilean
                            Government on the proposals submitted by the Minister of Finance. I
                            explained to the Minister, however, that I felt sure that once the
                            question of the Bank’s charter had been settled our Government would be
                            disposed to give every consideration to the Chilean proposals. I
                            ventured to suggest, however, that the amounts involved were very high
                            and that it would probably be advisable to take up first the most urgent
                            and necessary measures which I presumed would be those involving
                            supplies and materials to be used in reconstruction arising out of the
                            earthquake disaster. I also explained to the Minister that the 3 percent
                            rate of interest mentioned in the Chilean Government’s memorandum was, I
                            felt, too low, and that I thought that the Bank would probably not be
                            able to consider a figure below 4½ to 5 percent. Subject to these
                            qualifications, however, I felt sure that if the charter of the Bank
                            were renewed, our Government would do what it could in the matter of
                            extending credit to Chile for the purchasing in the United States of
                            needed materials.</p>
                        <p>Following my interview with Señor Ortega I received word that the
                            Minister of Hacienda would like to see me later in the afternoon, and I
                            have just returned from a conversation of more than an hour with Señor
                            Wachholtz. I was accompanied by the Counselor of the Embassy,<note n="46" xml:id="d467fn46">Wesley Frost.</note> but the Minister
                            himself was alone.</p>
                        <p>I outlined to Mr. Wachholtz the situation as I had given it to the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, only in more detail as of course Señor
                            Wachholtz is more familiar with the various proposals and is the one
                            bearing the brunt of trying to secure favorable consideration by
                            Congress of the Government’s proposed tax bill. Señor Wachholtz appeared
                            tired and worn and showed plainly the effect of the arduous two weeks he
                            had been through in his negotiations with Congress since my
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>After expressing appreciation of the sympathetic reception which I told
                            him his proposals had received in Washington, he asked me whether I
                            could give him any assurances as to the possibility of loans from the
                            United States either from the Government or bank loans of some nature or
                            other. I told him quite frankly that all that I could do was to assure
                            him that once the charter of the Bank had been renewed I felt sure our
                            Government would be willing to receive him or any delegate he might
                            decide to send with a view to examining the various proposals, but
                            reiterated that I thought it would be a wise move on his part to reduce
                            the amounts for the present, at any rate to essentials and to materials
                            for projects most urgently required. <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0449"/>I said that of course anything having to do with
                            necessary earthquake reconstruction would naturally commend itself to
                            the particular sympathy of the Government and the people of the United
                            States, and that I wondered whether it would not be a wise move to begin
                            with certain of these measures, then later perhaps presenting the more
                            urgent aspects of his general economic (<hi rend="italic">fomento</hi>)
                            plan. At the same time I explained to the Minister as I had already done
                            in my talks with him prior to my departure that a determination by the
                            Chilean Government to continue with the maintenance of the present debt
                            plan and a moderate attitude toward American companies and investments
                            in Chile would do more in my opinion to secure favorable consideration
                            of the various projects he had in mind than any other factor. Not
                            unnaturally, perhaps, I said New York and even Washington were looking
                            with some apprehension as to what the new Government’s attitude might be
                            in these directions, and I felt it my duty to state quite frankly that
                            drastic action against the American companies would make it very
                            difficult, if not impossible, for our Government or for one of its
                            agencies, e. g. the Export-Import Bank, to consider favorably or with
                            the same sympathetic approach the plans the Minister was putting
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he understood the situation clearly but that on
                            the other hand he was in a very difficult position as the Government
                            must have money and must get it somewhere. We suggested that possibly
                            the abandonment for the present at least of the proposed construction of
                            two cruisers might help out. The Minister admitted that this would yield
                            a saving of $4,000,000 a year which over his proposed 5 year period
                            would certainly amount to a very considerable sum. However, he refused
                            to commit himself on this subject and both Mr. Frost and I received the
                            distinct impression that the Government’s decision on this point, which
                            both parties have avoided publicly discussing, has not yet been
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked if I could give him any indication as to up to what
                            amounts the Export-Import Bank would be willing to give credits to
                            Chile. I replied that I felt that discussion of amounts was futile at
                            this time, certainly until we had some further word as to the terms
                            under which the charter of the Bank would be renewed.</p>
                        <p>The Minister went on to say that credits for the purchase of needed
                            materials in the United States would not be enough, that actual cash
                            would also be required, and that this they would have to secure from
                            outside Chile. Pressed on this point he explained that using as a basis
                            of argument a total of $80,000,000 over a five-year period this would be
                            $16,000,000 a year, of which he thought 70 percent could be in materials
                            furnished, but the remaining 30 percent would have to be cash.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>The Minister asked me whether I could give him definite information as to
                            our Government’s proposals with regard to the charter of the Bank. I
                            explained that the hearings were in progress when I left and that
                            various changes had been suggested, among them being one to restrict to
                            $100,000,000 the total amount which the Bank could have outstanding at
                            any one time in the form of credits. I understood that the bill renewing
                            the charter of the Bank had been favorably acted upon by the Senate with
                            this proviso and returned to the House, where I thought it possible that
                            further changes might be made, perhaps even in the direction of
                            increasing the amount mentioned above. The Minister seemed to be
                            somewhat concerned over the limitation suggested, adding that he thought
                            it probable that Brazil alone would be able to use up the $52,000,000
                            remaining,—$48,000,000 being the sum which he understood was already
                            outstanding. I told the Minister that I felt sure that every
                            consideration would be given to Chile’s needs and that frankly for the
                            present more than that I could not say. The Minister seemed to be most
                            anxious to know whether, under the new or revised powers of the Bank, it
                            would not be possible to have a cash loan in some form made available. I
                            told him that this was a question which I could not answer: that up to
                            the present I understood that the Bank’s powers had not included loans
                            of that type and from the tenor of Congress when I left it seemed
                            unlikely that the powers of the Bank would be enlarged in this
                            direction: that the general inclination seemed on the contrary to be to
                            restrict the powers of the Bank.</p>
                        <p>I told Señor Wachholtz, who appeared to be very discouraged at the
                            prospects before him, that I expected within the next few days that we
                            would have more definite word with regard to the renewal of the Bank’s
                            charter and that then I hoped to be in a position to discuss the whole
                            question with him in more definite form. He said that his main
                            difficulty was that in his sessions with the Congressional Committee he
                            was being pressed as to the possibility of an external loan being
                            accorded Chile, and until he was able to give some definite reply on
                            this point the situation was going to remain difficult if not critical
                            for the Government. I told him that naturally the question of loans by
                            private banks, or agencies not connected with the Government, was
                            outside of my jurisdiction and was a question which he and his
                            Government would have to take up with the banks themselves. I said that
                            much as I should like to give him some encouragement I could not
                            properly do so at this time: that it would only create misunderstanding
                            later if we were to give him the impression now that something along
                            these lines might be forthcoming or he on his part should give the
                            impression to the Congress here that a loan or loans of some nature from
                            the United States would be forthcoming later. I did say, however, that I
                            felt that if he would be willing to proceed for the present <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0451"/>on the basis of continuing under the
                            present foreign debt arrangement and to show a moderate attitude in
                            dealing with American companies and others having investments in Chile
                            and content himself with securing consideration of the immediate needs
                            of the Government through credits extended by the Export-Import Bank, I
                            felt that such procedure would create a most favorable impression abroad
                            and very possibly increase Chile’s credit to the extent of later
                            enabling them to secure loans or credits of some sort along the lines
                            which he had envisioned.</p>
                        <p>The Minister admitted that perhaps what I said might well be true, but
                            frankly the Government was faced with a difficult problem and that he
                            feared that more immediate assistance would be required and that for
                            this purpose the Government might find it necessary to have recourse to
                            the American companies for financial assistance as well as possibly
                            revising their stand on the foreign debt. In any case he said he would
                            proceed very carefully, particularly bearing in mind what I had said
                            about the necessity of doing nothing to upset the favorable impression
                            which the Chilean Government had already created and the good will with
                            which he knew the government at Washington would approach the proposals
                            he had placed before them in his memoranda<note n="47" xml:id="d467fn47">Not found in Department files.</note> which I had taken with me on

                            is in entire accord with your excellent presentation of this

                        <p>The Department is now giving earnest and urgent consideration to the
                            Chilean situation and hopes to be able within the next few days to
                            telegraph you an indication of what this Government may be in a position

                        <p>The Department continues to be greatly interested in the development of
                            events in Chile, especially as bearing upon American investment and
                            trade. The position in Washington at the moment appears to be as
                            follows:</p>
                           <p>(1) It is believed that it is essential to keep before the
                                        Chilean Government the necessity of avoiding all action
                                        vis-à-vis American interests of a confiscatory or
                                        discriminatory character. It is expected that the Chilean
                                        Government will deal with them according to the established
                                        rules of international law. American enterprise of course
                                        must make an equitable contribution to the needs of the
                                        country and government.</p>
                                    <p>We hope of course that the Chilean Government will not
                                        suspend payments on its dollar external loans. The
                                        maintenance of such payments would make any action by this
                                        Government easier to carry through and complete suspension
                                        would make American governmental assistance difficult.
                                        However, the Department is not prepared to take a rigid
                                        stand in this matter and if, as part of its general program,
                                        the Chilean Government should reduce debt payments for a
                                        limited period, it might be that we would not assume a
                                        critical position.</p>
                                <p>(2) The Chilean economy appears to be in real difficulty. Neither
                                    the Chilean Government nor the American enterprises operating
                                    within the Chilean economy can expect to overcome the necessity
                                    for adjustments or sacrifices by securing large scale financial
                                    assistance from the American Government. Nor would such a
                                    policy, involving as it might the creation of substantial new
                                    debt without proper adjustment of underlying conditions, be
                                    mutually beneficial in the long run.</p>
                           <p>(3) Keeping clearly in mind these observations, the American
                                        Government would like to be helpful in the circumstances. It
                                        is therefore fully prepared to give consideration to such
                                        proposals for financial assistance or cooperation as the
                                        Chilean Government may wish to present. However, before any
                                        action could be taken on such proposals this Government, and
                                        the Treasury and the Export-Import Bank in particular, would
                                        have to be convinced that the whole program contemplated by
                                        the Chilean Government promised to establish a sound working
                                        basis for Chile, and that the assistance requested of the
                                        United States would be a fair contribution to the general
                                        adjustment undertaken by the Chilean authorities and the
                                        private economic interests involved. Furthermore, such
                                        assistance could probably only be carried through with the
                                        consent of Congress as it would likely involve the necessity
                                        of raising the present limit upon the operations of the
                                        Export-Import Bank or other congressional authority.</p>
                                    <p>If the Chilean authorities formulate any requests or you wish
                                        to formulate any, the Department will discuss them promptly
                                        with the Treasury and Export-Import Bank. For your own
                                        guidance: <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0453"/>

                                            <item>The Chilean plans for expenditures amounting to 25
                                                hundred million pesos seem over-ambitious if they
                                                are contingent upon raising four-fifths of the
                                                amount by foreign loans. We doubt whether an
                                                appreciable amount, if any, could be raised abroad.
                                                It would seem that the program should be started on
                                                a small enough scale to give reasonable assurance
                                                that it can be financed internally and externally
                                                and that any credits granted may be repaid within a
                                                reasonable period of time.</item>

                        <p>64. At a meeting held yesterday between representatives of the

                            the Export-Import Bank, it was agreed that it would be desirable to
                            extend an invitation to the Chilean Minister of Finance to come to
                            Washington to discuss economic cooperation between Chile and the United
                            States as soon as his Government had drawn up a specific economic and
                            rehabilitation plan to place before us. It was also agreed to proceed to
                            attempt to secure from the Congress increased loaning powers for the
                            Export-Import Bank, probably in the form of loaning powers specifically
                            reserved for transactions with the other American republics. In addition
                            it was agreed that if the Chilean Government submitted a request for a
                            loan of gold, similar to that <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0454"/>envisaged in the Brazilian arrangements,<note n="50" xml:id="d470fn50">See <ref target="#pg_348">pp. 348</ref> ff.</note> as a part of a
                            reasonable program of economic cooperation, an endeavor would be made to
                            secure congressional authorization.</p>
                        <p>The Department is very perturbed over the vacillating attitude of the
                            Minister of Finance reported in your despatch no. 636 of April 19.<note n="51" xml:id="d470fn51">Not printed.</note> It feels in particular
                            that an essential condition of any arrangement for economic cooperation
                            would be an assurance from the Chilean Government that at least the
                            present small interest payments on the external debt be continued. In
                            view of this attitude of the Minister of Finance it is suggested that in
                            your discretion you may find it desirable to discuss the entire
                            situation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the President
                            outlining the Department’s position as indicated in previous telegrams,
                            and extending the invitation mentioned above if you deem it
                            expedient.</p>

                        <p>73. Department’s telegram No. 64, April 25, 1 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>]
                            p.m. After a talk with the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs for
                            Commerce in which I brought the substance of the Department’s telegram
                            No. 64 to his attention we agreed that it would be advisable for me to
                            have another talk with the Minister of Finance and to extend to him an
                            invitation to go to Washington for the purpose mentioned in the
                            Department’s telegram. I found the Minister of Finance in a much more
                            optimistic mood following the successful passage of his reconstruction
                            bill. He expressed appreciation of the invitation and assured me that it
                            is his intention to prepare more specific plans to place before us and
                            probably to have one or more officials proceed to Washington when these
                            are completed. He hopes this will be not later than the middle of May.
                            He thinks it would not be advisable to proceed himself for the present,
                            first, because his presence will be required here and also as his visit
                            might create comment. He might, however, follow later after the
                            preliminaries had been concluded.</p>
                        <p>At the same time he has asked me to assure the Department, as did the
                            Under Secretary for Commerce, that while the authorization to use the
                            funds set aside for the debt service remains in the law just passed the
                            Government has no intention of availing itself of this power. He
                            intimates that the clause once reinserted could not, for political
                            reasons, be deleted.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that yesterday
                            Señor Wachholtz, the Chilean Minister of Hacienda, who was a dinner
                            guest in my home, took occasion late in the evening to bring up the
                            question of his visit to Washington, a question which I had studiously
                            avoided.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he had received information to the effect that
                            the Export-Import Bank still has substantial funds at its disposal, due
                            to the fact that the Brazilian Government has not availed itself of the
                            credits offered by the Bank. I replied that my personal impression has
                            been that the Bank may still be in a position to grant moderate credits
                            to Chile, although I have had no information to the effect that this was
                            due to any non-implementation of our Brazilian undertakings. The
                            Minister stated that the Corporations of Fomento and Reconstruction will
                            desire credits for electrical machinery, road-making machinery, and
                            agricultural machinery, possibly to the amount of 10 or 15 million
                            dollars. He added that he has received offers of credits from Germany,
                            and without intimating that he will refuse them nevertheless suggested
                            that he prefers American credits in so far as feasible. He inquired
                            whether any credits granted by the Export-Import Bank could be made
                            direct to the two Corporations in question. I answered that in general
                            the credits were granted to American export firms, but that it has not
                            been my understanding that the granting of direct credits to the
                            Corporations would be entirely impossible. He mentioned that he would
                            not wish the credits to be granted to the Chilean Government (perhaps
                            alluding to the Brazilian arrangements) but rather to the Corporations,
                            so that the transaction would be a commercial one between the Bank and
                            the Corporations. Finally he alluded once more to the possibilities for
                            the conclusion of a trade agreement between Chile and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I am disposed to feel that, without the faintest solicitation on my part,
                            Señor Wachholtz has thus more or less outlined the terms under which he
                            would consider a visit to Washington to be generally advantageous. At
                            the outset of our talk he mentioned that he has been feeling that the
                            present time is not very propitious, either from the standpoint of
                            Chilean internal politics or the standpoint of American internal
                            politics, for negotiations, and from his remarks it was evident that he
                            has given a good deal of attention to the situation in the United
                            States. As these statements were merely prefatory to his further
                            statements outlined in the preceding paragraph, it seems evident that
                            they <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0456"/>were intended principally
                            to assume a tactical position before indicating the conditions which
                            might render the Washington visit fruitful.</p>
                        <p>There would appear to be no doubt that the types of machinery specified
                            by Señor Wachholtz will be needed here in the near future, and that they
                            will be imported either from Germany or the United States. It seems not
                            unlikely that imports will be made from both countries, and that the
                            share which comes from the United States will be determined to a good
                            extent by the granting or the withholding of Export-Import Bank credits.
                            There are two motives which would impel the Minister to conclude
                            contracts in the United States, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) his belief
                            that American machinery is on the whole superior, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) his desire to demonstrate to his countrymen that the
                            present Chilean Government and the Corporations which it has created
                            command confidence in the United States. The second motive is presumably
                            much the stronger of the two. It may be added that Señor Wachholtz would
                            probably be pleased by the personal prestige and honors incidental to a
                            journey by him to Washington; and also that he is friendly to the United
                            States and is by no means indifferent to the building up of amity and
                            goodwill from genuinely patriotic and idealistic motives.</p>
                        <p>I must frankly state that his interest in the trade agreement seemed to
                            be minor; although, as the Department is aware, in my own mind the trade
                            agreement is more important from the standpoint of the general and
                            permanent relations between the two countries. I have the impression
                            that the considerations which render it important are less familiar to
                            the Minister than are the considerations directly affecting the
                            financial plans which he has sponsored for the economic upbuilding of
                            Chile, although this is not the case with regard to the group of
                            superior officers who have been for years associated with the Chilean
                            Government and its problems, and which includes Señores García,<note n="52" xml:id="d472fn52">Desiderio García, Under Secretary for

                            and Guillermo Gazitúa.<note n="57" xml:id="d472fn57">Guillermo Gazitúa,
                                Counselor of the Chilean Embassy in the United States, formerly an
                                economist in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>If the Department should decide that the Wachholtz visit is still
                            desirable, after an examination of the terms which he has sketched, I
                            should personally still be disposed strongly to urge that an attempt be
                            made to reach the stage of announcing the intention to negotiate a trade
                            agreement with Chile synchronously with any announcement which may be
                            made respecting Export-Import Bank credits. The two announcements taken
                            together would manifestly constitute an important event in
                            Chilean-American relations, whereas the granting of <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0457"/>credits alone, in the limited amounts
                            which it is understood might be managed, could perhaps not very readily
                            be presented to the public as of outstanding importance. It would
                            moreover leave unsatisfied the group of informed and patriotic Chilean
                            economic officials who continue to be earnestly preoccupied by the
                            balance of payments between the two countries, and would thus be
                            inconclusive.</p>
                        <p>… I have the impression that Señor Wachholtz is now so firmly entrenched
                            in his position, and enjoys so thoroughly the confidence of President
                            Aguirre, that he will expect and insist upon carrying through the
                            negotiations personally rather than transferring them to Foreign Affairs
                            Minister Ortega or any other official. If he is accompanied by Señores
                            García and Goytia, as the latter has hinted tome is apt to be the case,
                            there would seem to be no reason why a delegation headed by him could
                            not negotiate fully as effectively as one headed by the Foreign
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>It need not be added that any expression of the Department’s views for
                            the guidance of the Embassy would presumably be most helpful to
                            Ambassador Bowers when the latter reaches Chile in the immediate
                            future.</p>

                        <p>127. Referring to my airmail despatch No. 856 of August 19, 1939
                            Wachholtz today through Goytia and Commercial Attaché orally but
                            definitely requested Embassy to ascertain at once whether Export-Import
                            Bank can grant the Corporation of Fomento direct credits to not less
                            than 10 million dollars if possible for 3 years, 5 million dollars to be
                            used during remainder of 1939 primarily for purchase of agricultural
                            machinery, balance to be used as occasion arises during 1940 for
                            electrical and other machinery. Question of interest rate was not
                            discussed. Goytia brought out again the fact that the Corporation is
                            being constantly urged by the German Embassy to avail itself of
                            favorable offers of German agricultural and other machinery. In this
                            connection the Department’s instructions are requested as to whether if
                            the response is favorable Wachholtz should be invited again to visit
                            Washington in the immediate future at which time the granting of the
                            credits would be announced. Also whether Department’s announcement of
                            intention to negotiate a trade agreement with Argentina<note n="58" xml:id="d473fn58">Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 26, 1939, pp. 166–170.</note> may signify
                            that a solution of the exchange question has <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0458"/>been formulated which might permit a similar
                            announcement as to a Chilean-American trade agreement during Wachholtz’s
                            presence in the United States. It should be borne in mind that the
                            credits mentioned above are desired at the earliest possible time.</p>

                        <p>108. Your 127, August 24, 1 p.m. As you are aware the activities of the
                            Export-Import Bank are severely restricted as a result of the failure of
                            the House of Representatives to consider a bill including a provision
                            which would have increased the lending power of the Bank. Nevertheless,
                            the Export-Import Bank has indicated that it is prepared to consider the
                            extension of credits of up to $5,000,000 to facilitate exports during
                            the next 6 months of American equipment urgently required by the Chilean
                            development program. Under the present circumstances the Export-Import
                            Bank is not in a position to undertake any commitments beyond this
                            amount, but it would, of course, consider further credits if its lending
                            functions were increased at some subsequent date.</p>
                        <p>The operation would take the form of facilitating the financing of
                            specific exports by American concerns, and would in no sense be a
                            “direct” credit which would place freely disposable funds in the hands
                            of the Chilean authorities. There would be no objection to sales of
                            American products to the Corporation of Fomento, but it would be assumed
                            that this was a governmental agency. The mechanism would probably be a
                            discounting by the Export-Import Bank, with or without partial or full
                            recourse, of notes received by American exporters from the Chilean
                            purchaser. It is assumed that provision would be made for amortizing the
                            notes out of the proceeds of the new copper and other revenues.</p>
                        <p>It will be necessary for this Government to have full information as to
                            what materials and equipment would be included in the $5,000,000 amount,
                            and the relation of these specific requests to the whole Chilean
                            development program. It is assumed that first purchases will be for the
                            most urgent purposes.</p>
                        <p>The rate of interest on such credits of 8 years is a matter for
                            discussion with the Chilean authorities. The rate of interest for
                            similar arrangements with other countries has been set at 5 percent.
                            There is at present some discussion of moderate reduction in this rate,
                            but a rate of three percent appears to be out of the question.</p>
                        <p>Regarding your inquiry concerning a visit by the Minister of Finance to
                            Washington, this Government has already invited Wachholtz to come to
                            this country, and will be pleased to receive him.</p>
                        <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>Extensive informal preliminary discussions regarding a trade agreement
                            are taking place between members of the Department and the Chilean
                            Counselor of Embassy. Information regarding this phase of possible
                            discussions with the Minister of Finance will be made available to you

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s confidential
                            telegraphic instruction No. 108 of August 26, 5 p.m., and to my telegram
                            No. 144 of September 9, 2 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>] p.m., I have the
                            honor to report that on September 11th I visited the Chilean Minister of
                            Hacienda, don Roberto Wachholtz.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister of the substance of the Department’s telegram
                            above cited, leaving with him a brief minute for the guidance of the
                            officials of the Fomento Corporation. The latter had already been
                            informally apprised, through conversations with Señores Goytia and
                            García of the attitude of the Department and of the Export-Import
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>Señor Wachholtz promised to secure the full information requested by the
                            Department as to the precise equipment and materials to be acquired
                            through the credit of five million dollars, together with the relation
                            of these purchases to the program of the Corporation as a whole. There
                            is some question as to whether complete details can be furnished, as the
                            Corporation’s plans, while now in fairly complete form, have not been
                            worked out fully on all specific points.</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0460"/>
                        <p>Señor Wachholtz likewise confirmed the statement made by officials of the
                            Fomento Corporation to the Commercial Attaché that the Corporation hopes
                            for an interest rate of four percent. He was informed that this
                            indication had already been telegraphed to the Department and that the
                            latter’s reaction would be conveyed to him when received.</p>
                        <p>The Minister voluntarily brought up the matter of a visit by him to
                            Washington during the latter part of the present calendar year, and
                            stated that he intends to accept the Department’s invitation at that
                            time. I had previously been informed, by Señor Goytia, that it will be
                            difficult for Señor Wachholtz to leave Santiago until the annual budget
                            law shall have been enacted by the Chilean Congress, which is apt to
                            occur by about the middle of November. Señor Wachholtz referred to the
                            possibility of the conclusion of a trade agreement between the two
                            countries, and I informed him that the Department had indicated to me
                            its favorable interest in this matter prior to my departure from
                            Washington.</p>

                        <p>121. Your 144, September 9, 1 p.m. The Export-Import Bank has allocated
                            $5,000,000 for the discounting of notes received by American exporters
                            from the Chilean Fomento Corporation in connection with the purchase of
                            American equipment urgently required during the next 6 months by the
                            Chilean development program. Such notes are to bear 4 percent interest
                            and to be amortized in semiannual instalments during a period of 8
                            years. It is expected that provision would be made for amortizing the
                            notes out of the proceeds of the new copper and other revenues.</p>
                        <p>The utilization of the $5,000,000 credit is contingent upon the favorable
                            consideration by the Export-Import Bank of individual specific requests,
                            and it will of course be necessary for this Government to have full
                            information as to what materials and equipment would be included, and
                            the relation of these to the whole Chilean development program.</p>
                        <p>As was indicated in the Department’s 108, August 26, 5 p.m., the
                            Export-Import Bank will reserve the right to work out each individual
                            transaction with the American exporters involved, with or without
                            partial or full recourse to such exporters.</p>

                        <p>178. For the Under Secretary. Wachholtz Minister of Finance and thought
                            to be strong man of the Government asked to see me at my house this
                            afternoon for certain advice. He is prepared to accept the invitation to
                            Washington and to sail on <hi rend="italic">Santa Lucia</hi> arriving at
                            New York on November 15. He sets forth certain purposes of the visit as
                            follows: first, to do what he can to facilitate the commercial treaty;
                            second, to discuss the possibility of getting additional credits from
                            the Export-Import Bank; third, to go over the development plans here in
                            detail and to get in touch with material people concerning purchases
                            required under these plans; fourth, to improve the exchange situation by
                            arranging if possible a longer term loan from Central Bank; fifth, he
                            refers to conversations between Chilean and our delegates at Panama City
                            about the needs of a better defense and patrol of the Pacific Coast and
                            he proposes to discuss this matter with us.</p>
                        <p>He wishes some intimation of what we may want to discuss so he can take
                            with him the necessary documentation.</p>
                        <p>If he goes he will be accompanied by Pedugal [<hi rend="italic">Pedregal</hi>], Vice President of Fomento Corporation, Alfonso
                            Fernandez, head of the Amortization Board, and possibly De la Cuarda,
                            head of Exchange Control Commission.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted while most of the matters he mentions are under his
                            jurisdiction, one at least is a matter for Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            though in that case, the first, there are features his department would
                            determine. In the meanwhile he wishes no publicity.</p>
                        <p>My impression is his visit would greatly clarify things in which we are
                            interested. Since he must have a definite reaction to his visit in time
                            to make reservations, please reply at earliest possible moment.</p>

                        <p>140. Your 178, October 11, 8 p.m. Please inform the President, Ortega and
                            Wachholtz that this Government has been gratified to learn of their
                            interest in an official visit to Washington in accordance with the
                            invitation already extended. The invitation was extended specifically to
                            the Minister of Finance in view of the primarily financial character of
                            the problems which it was expected would be discussed at the time of the
                            invitation. As you point out, however, the scope of discussions would
                            now be broadened to cover additional subjects not directly of a
                            financial nature. Therefore please indicate to the Chilean Government
                            that this Government would be very glad to receive whichever Minister
                            the Chilean Government deems it desirable to send.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the matters for discussion which you mention, the visit as
                            planned would very appropriately coincide with the inception in
                            Washington of the Inter American Economic and Financial Advisory
                            Committee created at the Panama consultation.<note n="59" xml:id="d480fn59">Resolution XIII, Organization of the Economic

                                    for the later stages of the formal trade agreement negotiations.
                                    Following the hearings which begin on November 27 and the
                                    analysis of briefs submitted, these negotiations will probably
                                    not get under way until December 15, and for some time
                                    thereafter will probably consist of detailed commodity
                                    discussions of a technical nature.</item>

                                <item>With regard to your points 2 and 4, reference is made to the
                                    Department’s No. 108 of August 26, 5 p.m. As therein indicated,
                                    the Export-Import Bank exhausted every resource in order to set
                                    aside the $5,000,000 for the discounting of notes to be
                                    delivered to United States exporters in payment for purchases by
                                    the Fomento Corporation. It will thus be impossible to extend
                                    further credits of any sort unless and until the Congress
                                    increases the loaning powers of the Bank. It cannot be stated
                                    definitely now when such Congressional consideration will take
                                    place.</item>
                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>In the event it is decided to have the visiting Minister arrive on
                            November 15 as tentatively indicated, it is very important that any <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0463"/>publicity in connection with
                            the visit should not state as one of its purposes the discussion of
                            further credits, until after Congressional consideration of the program
                            of financial cooperation. Such publicity might be unfavorably received
                            by the Congress if it occurred prior to its consideration of granting
                            the additional powers necessary to permit the extension of such credits,
                            and might prejudice the whole program of financial cooperation with the
                            other American Republics. Also, in the event of the arrival of the
                            visiting Minister prior to trade agreement public hearings, any
                            publicity giving the impression that an important Chilean official was
                            discussing the matter of carrying on negotiations might have unfortunate
                            repercussions in this country, both with the public and the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances outlined, the stated purposes of the visit if
                            made in November should necessarily be definitely limited to the
                            inception of the Advisory Committee, defense conversations and
                            discussions of the implementation of the $5,000,000 credit already
                            extended. If the visit were to be postponed a fortnight or more, there
                            would be no objection to publicity regarding the trade agreement
                            negotiations aspect of the visit.</p>

                            inopportune since he would have to return with nothing to show for the
                            journey. Pedregal of the Fomento Corporation could settle the use of the
                            5 million. He said his policy of reasonable conservatism which is real
                            has centered upon him the fire of others with less sense of financial
                            responsibility and he could not afford to strengthen the hands of his
                            enemies by going and returning empty handed.</p>

                                of naval defense, he indicated his understanding that his Government
                                is interested, but that he would not be a natural negotiator and
                                that no publicity would be desirable.</item>

                            <item>The fact is that the war has placed Chile in a very embarrassing
                                financial position which is expected to extend a few months and she
                                needs support now. In this connection he mentioned the authorization
                                (by law 6334) to suspend payments on the American debt which would
                                benefit Chile greatly but added he did not want to do it.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Frost interpreted this as a hint of pressure but it did not impress me
                            that way. He had literally put his cards on the table regarding his
                            personal position and I think he mentioned the possibility as something
                            unfortunate that might be forced upon Chile in her serious embarrassment
                            precipitated by the war.</p>
                        <p>Clearly he will not visit Washington unless reasonably assured some
                            practical results for Chile and his position certainly is politically
                            sound from local considerations.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate the Department’s comment on points 2 and 3.</p>

                        <p>147. Your 187, October 17, 5 p.m. With respect to your paragraph 2, the
                            Brazilian arrangements contemplated a short term acceptance credit to
                            the Banco do Brasil, all of which has been utilized, and a general
                            commitment subject to individual consideration of specific proposals.
                            Unlike the general commitment of $5,000,000 recently undertaken for
                            Chile, the Brazilian general commitment specified no amount and as a
                            consequence the Export-Import Bank has not set aside any specific funds
                            at all for the purpose, whereas in the case of Chile the $5,000,000 has
                            been allocated specifically. As stated in the Department’s 140, October
                            14, 1 p.m., there will be no further funds to undertake operations
                            either with Brazil or Chile pending congressional action.</p>
                        <p>With regard to your paragraph 3, authorization for an increase in the
                            lending powers of the Export-Import Bank will be requested of the
                            Congress at the earliest convenient moment. At the present juncture, the
                            Department is unable to forecast whether this request will be made of
                            the Congress at the special or regular session.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit herewith a
                            memorandum of my conversation with Señor Pedregal made by Mr. Frost who
                            was present <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0465"/>during the
                            conversation. Absolutely convinced as I am that the President, Wachholtz
                            and Ortega look on a possible suspension of debt payments as a calamity
                            to Chile, I told Señor Pedregal that I was positive that a frank
                            discussion of the whole situation in general could be had without
                            creating the impression in our minds that a threat was implied or
                            intended. I am sure that the Department would like to hear just what is
                            in the minds of the responsible leaders of the Government here and that
                            a frank and full exposition such as he gave me here will furnish the
                            Department with useful background for all the negotiations regarding
                            credits and the commercial treaty.</p>

                            <p>Señor Pedregal visited the Ambassador on the morning of October 27th,
                                and discussed the substance of the Department’s telegram No. 147 of
                                October 21, 2 p.m., which had been conveyed to him by Señor
                                Wachholtz. He expressed appreciation for the information thus
                                furnished, and indicated that in conversation between himself and
                                Señor Wachholtz the conclusion had been reached that there is ground
                                for hoping and expecting results from a visit to Washington at a
                                later time. Meanwhile he requested the Ambassador’s advice as to the
                                desirability of a journey to the United States by himself (Señor
                                Pedregal) in the immediate future.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador stated that in his personal opinion such a journey by
                                Señor Pedregal could be very useful, particularly in affording to
                                the Department direct and detailed information as to the Chilean
                                point of view. The Ambassador felt that, while the Department is
                                already aware of the effects of the war and of last January’s
                                earthquake upon the Chilean national economy, a personal
                                presentation of these factors would be helpful. The extent to which
                                Chile’s foreign trade has been affected, and to which her productive
                                capacity is handicapped by reconstruction necessities, merits full
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>In the second place the Ambassador suggested that if or when the
                                question of the suspension of debt payments arises in conversations
                                with regard to additional credits, Señor Pedregal might frankly
                                indicate that anything he could say on this point would be on the
                                understanding that the Department would not ascribe to his remarks
                                any hint of menace. The Ambassador felt that by candidly explaining,
                                as Señor Pedregal had done in the Embassy last week, the earnest
                                desire of the Chilean Government to avoid suspension it would be <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0466"/>possible to secure the
                                approval of the Department for a realistic discussion of the
                                political and other elements with which the Chilean Administration
                                will have to deal.</p>
                            <p>Señor Pedregal expressed very genuine appreciation of the
                                Ambassador’s kindness in furnishing these two suggestions, in
                                response to the request which he had made upon the Ambassador. He
                                stated that, in accordance with conversations with Señor Wachholtz
                                he might proceed to Washington on the Chilean S.S. <hi rend="italic">Aconcagua</hi>, sailing November 15th, to reach Washington
                                about the 5th of December. This would permit him to furnish details
                                as to the $5,000,000 credit, and information as to the desirability
                                of further credits, prior to the termination of the public hearings
                                on the trade agreement. During the latter part of December, after
                                the conclusion of the hearings just mentioned, it might be possible
                                for Señor Pedregal to discuss the adaptation of the plans of the
                                Fomento Corporation to the tariff concessions which the trade
                                agreement could include. He realized that the trade agreement would
                                not be ready for signature by the end of December, when he would
                                probably be leaving Washington to return to Santiago; but had in
                                mind that he might advantageously study in collaboration with the
                                Department the mutually complementary features of the aims of his
                                corporation on the one hand and of the trade agreement on the other.
                                He might be accompanied by the head of the Amortization Institute,
                                Señor Alfonso Fernandez, and possibly by a member of the Exchange
                                Control Commission or of the staff of the Sub-Ministry of
                                Commerce.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Bowers promised to furnish Señor Pedregal with personal
                                letters of introduction, and to consult with him at least once again
                                prior to the beginning of the journey.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit herewith a
                            memorandum of a conversation with Señor Wachholtz, Minister of Finance,
                            and Señor Pedregal, active head of the Fomento Corporation, who was
                            leaving for Washington for discussions there with the nature of which
                            you are familiar. The conversation was in the nature of a final talk
                            before leaving and was on the initiative of the Minister of Finance, who
                            laid stress on the fact that Pedregal goes with his complete confidence
                            and as his personal representative. Aside from the fact that Señor
                            Pedregal deserves every consideration and attention on his own
                            personality and record, this emphasis on the part of the Minister would
                            seem to call for it.</p>

                        <p>I have found Señor Pedregal frank, business-like in his directness, and
                            of good will, and have assured him that he can talk in Washington with
                            our officials with equal frankness without fear of having his motives
                            misinterpreted. I have urged him, in other words, to paint a complete
                            picture of the Chilean situation as he and the Minister of Finance see
                            it, and have assured him that he will be heard sympathetically.</p>

                            <p>The Minister opened by stating that Señor Pedregal was being sent to
                                Washington with the full and complete confidence of the Chilean
                                Government, for whom he was authorized to speak. In the United
                                States at the present time are Señor Manuel Bianchi, Chilean
                                Ambassador to Spain, and Señor Alfonso Fernandez, head of the
                                Amortization Institute, with whom Señor Pedregal will consult. While
                                the Chilean Government has believed it better not to constitute
                                these three gentlemen into a formal commission, it apparently wishes
                                the American Government to treat them informally as
                                commissioners.</p>
                            <p>The Minister then adverted to Chile’s outstanding need for dollar
                                exchange, referring to the large volume of demands for dollars with
                                which the Exchange Control Commission now has to cope, covering
                                desired imports or commodities formerly procured from Europe. In
                                this connection he stated that the Chilean Government did not assume
                                the proposed trade agreement to constitute anything more than a very
                                limited corrective in furnishing dollar exchange, and requested
                                general comments from the Ambassador in regard to the trade
                                agreement.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador in reply indicated that the opposition to the
                                agreement in the United States had been political and based on local
                                economic interests, and should not be taken in Chile as indicating
                                any unfriendliness on the part of the American Senatorial and other
                                critics toward Chile. He further intimated the desirability that any
                                further studies or decisions to be made in Chile in connection with
                                the agreement be concluded at the earliest possible time, in order
                                that the instrument be signed by the end of the present month.
                                Minister Wachholtz stated that he would endeavor to facilitate the
                                studies still <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0468"/>outstanding,
                                as he could appreciate the circumstances which call for an early
                                termination of the negotiations if they are to be successful.</p>
                            <p>Referring to Chile’s need for dollar exchange, the Minister mentioned
                                the ocean freight situation, and stressed Chile’s need for ships. He
                                hoped that the American Government might be able to assist Chile in
                                acquiring additional tonnage (a matter which Mr. Pedregal had
                                previously mentioned as one of his errands to Washington); and
                                suggested that the only alternative would be for Chile to secure a
                                greater share of the traffic now handled by the American steamship
                                line here. While the C.S.A.V.<note n="60" xml:id="d484fn60">Compañía
                                    Sudamericana de Vapores.</note> has been admitted to the

                                    24, <ref target="#pg_416">p. 416</ref>.</note> this has only
                                been under conditions which he feels will impede it in taking over a
                                fair share of the traffic. In other words, he would like either more
                                ships or a greater share in the trade, and wishes the American
                                Government to interest itself. (This point was based on the earnest
                                Chilean contention, apparently well-founded, that Chile’s need for
                                dollars to pay ocean freights each year constitutes a very heavy
                                drain upon her dollar resources.)</p>
                            <p>The Minister then mentioned the need of his Government for experts in
                                the applied sciences. He stated that the Fomento Corporation
                                contemplates the establishment of experimental and research
                                laboratories to deal in a practical way with the various raw
                                material resources which Chile possesses. The securing of experts
                                and scientists to get this project under way would be difficult,
                                because of the high salaries commanded or demanded by American
                                consulting engineers, chemists, etc.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador referred to the standing offer of the American
                                Government to furnish experts from the technical bureaus of the
                                Departments of the Interior and Agriculture; and after some
                                discussion and elaboration the Minister failed to indicate any
                                definite reaction.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Chañaral (or Paipote) smelter, the Ambassador,
                                speaking purely from a psychological and political standpoint,
                                ventured the suggestion that it might be advisable not to include
                                among the first projects undertaken under the five million dollar
                                grant one which would manifestly injure important American interests
                                and perhaps give rise to criticism and opposition in the United
                                States of a potentially embarrassing character. Both Señores
                                Wachholtz and Pedregal at once expressed comprehension of this view,
                                and Señor Pedregal stated that he has arranged to visit New York
                                before going to Washington and to confer with the President of the
                                American Smelting and Refining Company. He hopes and expects to
                                reach an understanding with the latter before approaching the
                                Washington authorities; and, in accordance with the Ambassador’s
                                hint, will have <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0469"/>other
                                projects to submit in case it appears that the smelter project, in
                                which he has special faith, would entail difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Señor Pedregal indicated that he would furnish the Embassy with
                                biographic data which might be given appropriate use at Washington
                                and New York through the Embassy’s good offices. Both gentlemen
                                expressed appreciation of the attitude of the American Government,
                                and the Ambassador bade Godspeed to Señor Pedregal.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report as of possible
                            interest to the Department that from several sources members of the
                            staff of the mission have heard suggestions that the present (in view of
                            Chile’s great need for money) would be a particularly advantageous time
                            for Chile and the United States to reach an agreement transferring
                            ownership of Easter Island from the former to the latter. While none of
                            the people who have mentioned the idea is especially influential (two,
                            however, have close friendships among Leftist leaders), it is not
                            without some significance that the idea is being propagated, and it is
                            not inconceivable that in time Chilean official circles may decide to
                            explore the possibilities.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy is keeping under reference in this connection the
                            Department’s strictly confidential instruction No. 315 of February 4,
                                1938.<note n="61" xml:id="d485fn61">Not printed. It stated that
                                “while the United States Government has entertained at no time the
                                desire to acquire or to lease Easter Island, it does in fact have a
                                definite interest in any proposed sale or lease of this island to a
                                non-American power.” The Chargé was authorized to express to the
                                appropriate Chilean authorities this interest of his Government

                                <item>Have you considered a different angle? Easter Island is unique
                                    in possessing remains of prehistoric men—the great recumbent
                                    stone figures which have never yet been adequately explained. No
                                    serious scientific excavation work has been done on the Island.
                                    It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that it be
                                    preserved to science for all time. In this respect it is a
                                    little like the Galápagos Islands.<note n="62" xml:id="d486fn62">See <ref target="frus1935v04#pg_517">

                                <item>Would it be possible to tie up Easter Island and the Galápagos
                                    in a Pan-American trusteeship; the Islands to be preserved for
                                    all time against colonization and for natural science? Ecuador
                                    and Chile (if a reasonable sum could be arrived at) would be
                                    paid for the Islands over a period of years, the sovereignty to
                                    vest in the trustees; the trustees to protect them and prevent
                                    their use for military purposes. I do not like the idea of a
                                    lease. The payments would be made by all the American Republics
                                    over a period of years and in proportion to the total wealth of
                                    the Republics. This would put, of course, the greatest burden on
                                    the United States.</item>

                        <p>115. Referring to the Department’s circular, June 27, 7 p.m.,<note n="63a" xml:id="d487fn63a">
                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_1">p. 1</ref>.</note> taking advantage of the
                            regular weekly audience I saw the Foreign Minister at noon and brought
                            the matter discussed in this telegram to his attention. He expressed
                            great interest in it stating emphatically that he considered it of great
                            importance and utility especially at this time when the international
                            situation was so critical.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out however that due to its limited financial resources it
                            would be difficult for Chile to take advantage of the facilities which
                                <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0471"/>the joint resolution would
                            make available. After stressing how exposed the Chilean coast was and
                            how important Chilean raw materials would be in time of war he left the
                            implication that it would definitely be to our advantage to assist Chile
                            to obtain adequate instruments of defense (please see second paragraph
                            of despatch No. 603 of April 5th<note n="64" xml:id="d487fn64">Not
                                printed.</note>). The Minister also referred as a potential source
                            of danger to the large number of Japanese in Peru and to the German
                            problem here in Chile.</p>
                        <p>He then referred in this connection to the importance of Easter Island
                            especially in the event of a war involving Japan and mentioned the
                            possibility of its being utilized by the United States as a link in the
                            naval and aerial defense of this hemisphere. He thought that while there
                            could be no transfer of sovereignty, public opinion here would agree to
                            its being used in that way in view of the present troubled situation. He
                            said that he had last night expressed similar ideas to the Ecuadoran
                            Minister here (who I gather is contrary-minded) regarding the Galápagos
                            Islands, adding that he thought the present situation called for
                            courageous action which might, as in this instance, run somewhat counter
                            to sentimental ideas of ownership, et cetera.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Foreign
                            Minister Ortega seemed genuinely preoccupied over the international
                            situation when I saw him on June 28th as I reported in the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 115. His spontaneous reference to the possibility of Easter
                            Island’s being taken over by the United States and used as a naval and
                            aerial defense post shows that high officials here are apparently giving
                            careful thought to future eventualities. This attitude undoubtedly
                            reflects to some extent a feeling on the part of this Administration
                            that Easter Island is not of any particular value to Chile and that if
                            it were possible to turn it over to our Government for a consideration
                            it might be a good business transaction at a time when Chile urgently
                            needs funds.</p>
                        <p>This aspect of the matter, however, was not mentioned by the Foreign
                            Minister, nor did I feel it desirable to press him for further details
                            of this nature. He made it clear, however, that he did not feel <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0472"/>it would be possible for Chile
                            to surrender her sovereignty over the Island. I suppose that what Señor
                            Ortega had reference to was some sort of a lease agreement under which
                            Chile would retain sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>He stated frankly that he had discussed the question of the Galápagos and
                            Easter Islands with the Ecuadoran Minister here, showing that Chile may
                            be endeavoring to persuade the Ecuadoran Government to take a similar
                            view regarding the Galápagos, in the belief that Chile would not be able
                            to turn over Easter Island to the United States (in the event our
                            Government should be interested in the Island) unless Ecuador should be
                            willing to do the same with the Galápagos. In this way a united front on
                            the question could be created which would be useful in presenting the
                            matter to Latin American public opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Military Attaché informs me that he has had several persons tell him
                            that it would be a great mistake for our Government to make any
                            arrangements with the present Chilean Government affecting Easter
                            Island. This is undoubtedly a common viewpoint of the Opposition here at
                            present, which would of course resent any operation affecting Easter
                            Island which would result to the financial advantage of the Popular
                            Front regime. The same observation is made regarding the plan of
                            proposed financial cooperation between Chile and the United States.</p>
                        <p>In concluding my interview with the Foreign Minister I limited my remarks
                            to telling him that I would be very glad to forward his observations to
                            the Department.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on the
                            14th instant I called upon the Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            Señor Abraham Ortega, to pay my respects upon return from my absence
                            from Chile, and that the most significant phase of the conversation was
                            with regard to the possibility that Easter Island be fortified by the
                            United States. (See strictly confidential despatch No. 753 of July 1,
                            1939.)</p>
                        <p>The suggestion came up in connection with the question of cruiser
                            purchases by Chile; and as it was in the same connection that the
                            Foreign Minister mentioned the matter to Mr. Trueblood at a previous
                            interview there is ground for assuming that the acquisition of some form
                            of rights by the United States in the Island is connected <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0473"/>in the Foreign Minister’s mind with the
                            furnishing of a cruiser or cruisers on especially favorable terms by the
                            United States. The Minister did not contemplate the alienation of
                            Chile’s sovereignty over the Island but rather some plan which might
                            permit the latter’s use by the American Navy for undefined purposes over
                            an undefined period of years.</p>
                        <p>Señor Ortega inquired whether our Government recognizes that the defense
                            of Latin America, and particularly of the West Coast, would be of vital
                            consequence to the United States if a world conflagration should arise,
                            and I alluded to the recent address made by the Assistant Secretary of
                                War<note n="65" xml:id="d489fn65">Louis Johnson.</note> (see news
                            bulletin of July 5, 1939<note n="66" xml:id="d489fn66">Department of
                                State Radio Bulletin.</note>).</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would much appreciate receiving an instruction as to whether
                            a leasing arrangement would be of interest, and as to whether cruiser
                            construction for Chile in American Navy yards might figure as a setoff,
                            either directly or indirectly. It would seem that the Minister is more
                            than willing to receive proposals from us; and he definitely indicated a
                            desire to secure further views from the American Government at once if
                            possible.</p>

                            despatches Nos. 780 and 781 of July 19, 1939<note n="67" xml:id="d490fn67">Despatch No. 781 not printed.</note> referring to
                            the desire of the Chilean Government to obtain bids abroad for the
                            construction of certain vessels for the Chilean Navy. The Department
                            also received a note of July 28 from the Chilean Embassy<note n="68" xml:id="d490fn68">Not printed.</note> requesting that the Navy
                            Department furnish that Embassy with the names and addresses of
                            shipbuilders of whom it would be proper and convenient for the Chilean
                            Government to ask for tenders on these vessels.</p>
                        <p>While this Government is disposed to be as helpful as possible to the
                            Chilean Government in furnishing this information, and might be prepared
                            in fact, should certain legislation now pending in the Congress be
                            enacted at the present session and should the Chilean Government
                            officially request it to do so, to submit estimates for the construction
                            of some if not all of these vessels in the United States Navy Yards, <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0474"/>it would not in any case be
                            prepared to undertake such construction in exchange either directly or
                            indirectly for a lease of Easter Island.</p>
                        <p>Should the subject again be raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or
                            by any other responsible Chilean official, you are requested to inform
                            them that the United States Government is not interested at the present
                            time in leasing land or rights on Easter Island.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that it need hardly remind you, however, that
                            although this Government is not itself interested in acquiring rights or
                            land on Easter Island, the acquisition of such rights or lands by a
                            non-American power would, of course, be a cause for immediate concern to
                            this Government.</p>

                                    the information of the Committee, however, that although this

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s Instructions Nos. 241 and 242 of August 4
                            and August 12, 1939, respectively, with regard to the general problem of
                            naval strategy in the southern Pacific and to the possibility of the
                            utilization of Easter Island for naval communications or other
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>In the temporary absence of the Foreign Minister I had an informal
                            interview with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Señor Jocelín de
                            la Maza, on the 28th instant. This was in a sense preferable to an
                            interview with Señor Ortega, as subsequently to the preparation <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0476"/>of despatches Nos. 780 and 781
                            it had been learned that Señor de la Maza has been the official most
                            interested in the problems above indicated. In compliance with the
                            Department’s instructions I alluded to the discussions respecting the
                            Galápagos Islands, with which the Under Secretary was familiar, and to
                            the position assumed by the United States at that time, particularly as
                            to the territorial integrity of the Latin American Republics. Señor de
                            la Maza evidently appreciated this latter point, and also indicated that
                            the sentiment in his own country would not regard favorably any
                            openly-announced understanding by which Easter Island could be made
                            available for any type of use by any non-Chilean power.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary was frank in stating that his own interest in Chile’s
                            position in the naval and political strategy of the Pacific has been
                            greater than that of his colleagues in the Foreign Office; but went on
                            to say that he still feels that his country should be an element of
                            strength for the democratic powers in this part of the world. He had
                            previously informed Secretary Trueblood that he would be glad to see
                            political cooperation, as contradistinguished from economic cooperation,
                            between the United States, Chile and other “liberal” American
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>With reference to his possible designation as Chilean Ambassador to
                            Germany he stated that he does not anticipate this designation, although
                            he would be willing to serve if called upon. It appears that he was
                            brought up in a German-Chilean community in the south, and that his
                            primary education was in a German school; so that he at one time was
                            conversant with the German language, a conversancy which he says he has
                            not at all maintained.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Page 8 of my
                            despatch No. 76 of April 25, 1939,<note n="1" xml:id="d493fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> and to report that on the evening of May 10 I dined
                            with the Colombian Minister of Finance, Dr. Carlos Lleras Restrepo. The
                            Minister and I, in the presence of the President’s Private Secretary,
                            Dr. Humberto Salamanca, discussed the Colombian foreign debt and related
                            matters from 10:00 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. The more important phases of our
                            conversation may be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Introduction</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>I again explained to the Minister that, while neither the State
                            Department nor I could or would intervene directly in the debt problem,
                            we were very much interested to see it solved as soon as possible to the
                            satisfaction of all concerned; moreover, when appropriate, we would
                            always be happy to lend good offices and, recalling his and President
                            Santos’ kind offer to keep me informed, I was interested to learn of
                            recent developments.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">History of Negotiations</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that he greatly appreciated our interest. He then
                            recited a history of the debt negotiations, with which he, as
                            Comptroller General under the López administration, had been familiar.
                            He said to begin with the Colombian Government had been confused by the
                            multiplicity of entities claiming to represent bond owners. Even after
                            Mr. Hoover<note n="2" xml:id="d493fn2">Laurence E. de S. Hoover,
                                Secretary, Independent Bondholders Committee for Republic of

                            Committee, the Finance Ministry continued to receive communications from
                            that group. Repeatedly, the Colombian Government, in its desire to
                            adjust the matter, had endeavored to reduce negotiations to concrete
                            bases as, for instance, when President López in December 1935 <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0478"/>had addressed a long
                            communication to Mr. Reuben Clark of the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council, Inc., to which no reply had ever been received. The Government
                            had hoped for an adjustment when Professor Dana G. Munro<note n="3" xml:id="d493fn3">Professor of Latin American history and affairs,
                                Princeton University; representative of the Foreign Bondholders

                            express any opinion as to terms and methods of arriving at a debt
                            settlement, declaring that he could only listen to Colombia’s proposals.
                            Nevertheless, he summarily rejected the definite proposal made to him by
                            President López.<note n="5" xml:id="d493fn5">President López informed
                                Professor Munro before his departure from Bogotá in September 1937
                                that a proposal was being considered which provided for “No
                                reduction of principal; resumption of service with an interest rate
                                of 2 percent to be increased annually by ¼ percent up to a total of
                                3 percent; amortization at the rate of 1 percent to be used for the
                                purchase of bonds in the open market. The President said that a
                                suggested alternative proposal contemplated a 25 percent reduction
                                in principal, and interest at the rate of 2 percent with annual
                                increases of ½ percent up to a total of 4 percent.”
                                (821.51/2141)</note> Dr. Munro was uninterested in such important
                            influences as factors affecting Colombia’s ability to pay—the internal
                            political situation, etc. In short, his and the Council’s function
                            seemed to be not of collaboration but simply to refuse all offers until
                            such time as a satisfactory one happened along. Despite the sterility of
                            Professor Munro’s visit, the Colombian Government continued its
                            endeavors to negotiate and did carry forward conversations with Mr.
                            Francis White of the Protective Council until, in late November 1937,
                            Brazil withdrew its support of coffee prices, whereupon Mr. White
                            discontinued discussions. The Minister of Finance in this connection
                            categorically confirmed the assertion made to me in Washington by
                            Ambassador Miguel López that he and the Colombian Government then
                            expressed their desire to pursue negotiations but the Protective Council
                            refused to do so. On this subject the Department will note that there is
                            a flat contradiction between the statements of the Colombians and of Mr.
                            White. Also, ex-President López, quite independently, has corroborated
                            to me all the aforequoted narration by the Minister.</p>
                        <p>Undiscouraged by these repeated delays, the Minister said, Colombia still
                            had hoped to reach a settlement before the change in administration
                            here, but no progress was made and therefore shortly before President
                            López left office it was suggested negotiations be postponed until after
                            the inauguration of Dr. Santos. Dr. Lleras referred with some bitterness
                            to the cable sent by Mr. Francis White to the incoming President on
                            inauguration day, August 7, 1938.</p>
                        <p>The Minister went on to say he had hoped rapidly to get congressional
                            approval of a debt program, but his ideas were attacked by many Senators
                            and Deputies who, having become accustomed during <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0479"/>five years to a pleasant forgetfulness
                            of obligations, insisted that Colombia emulate Chile,<note n="6" xml:id="d493fn6">See Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Annual Report 1937</hi> (New York, 1938), pp.
                                189 ff.</note> claiming that any other procedure would lead to the
                            Government’s negotiators being out-traded. It was only with difficulty
                            that legislation along these lines had been avoided and it had even
                            proved impossible to pass a law appointing a debt commission. This
                            failure was later remedied when on December 1, 1938 the Debt Commission
                            was appointed under the provisions of an obscure rider to a disrelated
                            law concerning the Ministry of Finance. The Commission had been
                            carefully selected to include members influential in all political
                            factions; in truth, the Conservative members had recently been chosen as
                            two of the five directors of that party. The Commission had met and
                            reviewed the information submitted to it by the Minister; it would not
                            be very active but would be most valuable in getting legislative
                            approval for the debt agreement finally consummated. The Minister said
                            that it was essential first to get an agreement and then to submit it to
                            Congress for approval. Were he to endeavor to obtain a blanket
                            authorization in advance it would be rigid, perhaps unworkable and
                            practically equivalent in its provisions to the unilateral offer made by
                            Chile. It was preferable to present a concrete proposal for acceptance
                            or rejection rather than to throw the general subject into an extended
                            and disordered debate. The Government was willing to exercise pressure
                            to obtain congressional ratification of a satisfactory debt agreement
                            but it could not and would not go beyond reasonable limits nor risk the
                            loss of its prestige and influence with the legislature for the balance
                            of President Santos’ term in office. The disposition of the majority of
                            the Senators and Deputies respecting the debt was well known and it
                            would be absolutely impossible for the Government to suggest terms more
                            severe than those proposed by President López to Dr. Munro in July 1937.
                            The administration was anxious to reach an adjustment as soon as
                            possible; in fact it was imperative that the debt agreement be submitted
                            to Congress, when it convenes on July 20, for approval and for inclusion
                            in next year’s budget. The arrangement when made must be a permanent—not
                            a temporary—one. Dr. Lleras feared if matters were not handled in this
                            way but were put over to a future Congress it would be impossible to get
                            the body’s acceptance of another settlement and Colombia would therefore
                            indefinitely continue in default. Speed was also essential because
                            within the next few months there would be held meetings to establish the
                            participation of the several Departments in the taxes received by the
                            National Government. This reallocation of income could not longer be
                            deferred and would mean reduction in net revenues received by the
                            National Government; thus making still less available for loan
                            service.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>The aforementioned López offer, when renewed with minor changes, would be
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Debt service to be resumed with interest at 2 percent for the
                                    first year, stepping up one-quarter of one percent each year
                                    thereafter until a maximum of 3 percent is reached in the fourth
                                    year, at which rate it would continue until extinction of the
                                    debt; amortization payments to be calculated on the basis of 50
                                    years from the date of original issuance of the loans, Le.
                                    approximately 40 years from the present time. Also, Colombia
                                    would wish to have in the agreement a provision permitting it to
                                    purchase bonds in the open market.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>I inquired how far negotiations had progressed between Ambassador Miguel
                            López and Mr. Francis White of the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council, Inc. The Minister replied that in addition to the necessary
                            data already forwarded to Washington, the Ambassador and his advisers
                            had requested further information which had recently been sent. As soon
                            as it was put in final shape the Minister expected it would be submitted
                            forthwith to Mr. White. It was now so complete there could be no
                            legitimate reason for further delay and he believed an agreement would
                            be reached in a surprisingly short time—within a week or two. He again
                            emphasized the need for speed and promised as soon as he received the
                            final figures from Washington he would give them to me. The data to be
                            submitted to Mr. White by the Government conclusively proves that the
                            aforementioned “López” terms are the best Colombia can offer and
                            represent the country’s maximum ability to pay. Mr. White and others had
                            failed to take into account not only political influences in Colombia
                            but also certain cold facts not apparent in the published statistics,
                            such as, for instance, that Colombian cotton imports last year had been
                            arbitrarily reduced by exchange restrictions, therefore the superficial
                            figures frequently gave an erroneous picture of conditions here.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Opinion of Terms</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>Towards the end of our interview, Dr. Lleras asked for my opinion of the
                            aforedescribed terms. I answered that my purely personal but nonetheless
                            frank conclusion was they were too low and would create a bad
                            impression, hurtful to Colombia’s reputation. I said primarily it was a
                            moral issue and then one of Colombia reestablishing its credit standing.
                            I mentioned the debt agreements with Santo Domingo, Cuba, Uruguay,
                            Province of Buenos Aires, etc., as indicating that a rate of at least 4
                            percent for a permanent settlement was necessary to reestablish
                            Colombia’s credit. I recalled that Argentina had not defaulted, yet last
                            year had to pay about 4½ percent for financing. I also referred to the
                            fact that full service on Colombia’s foreign national debt would only
                            amount to 3.3 percent of the country’s revenues <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0481"/>and the total national debt service to
                            12.6 percent, whereas other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
                            etc., must devote from 18 to 28 percent of their revenues to debt
                            service. The Minister countered by asking how I explained that Chile’s
                            credit had not been injured by her unilateral imposition of terms, less
                            favorable than those contemplated by Colombia; since according to recent
                            press announcements Chile’s credit must be good because her Finance
                            Minister was leaving for Washington there to negotiate a loan with the
                            United States Government. I replied that, as he well knew, Chile was
                            unable to obtain loans from banking or other private sources and was in
                            a serious economic predicament, which might lead to social
                            repercussions, the gravity of which could not be foreseen; while I had
                            no direct information on the subject, assuming the newspapers were
                            accurate, it was my impression that the United States Government might
                            enter into discussions with the Chilean Finance Minister solely in the
                            spirit of the good neighbor to try and help that country out of a
                            difficult situation; and in the final analysis he surely would not place
                            Colombia on as low an economic plane as Chile now had to endure. I added
                            that I did not pretend even if Colombia were to resume debt service in
                            full it would overnight make available long-term financing, which might
                            have to be deferred for some years, but banking credits would be given,
                            I believed, almost immediately and in the end Colombia would benefit
                            substantially. In this connection I recalled how during the Balmaceda
                            Revolution in Chile<note n="7" xml:id="d493fn7">See <ref target="frus1891#pg_313">

                            Government and the Revolutionary Party on the due date of a loan in
                            London had made the payment, each fearing that the other would forget to
                            do sd. I had observed 30 years later how this one act had redounded
                            substantially to Chile’s benefit in the negotiation of other loans in
                            the United States. The Minister said my explanation had entirely
                            satisfied him.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that even granting the memorandum the Minister had
                            promised to send me proved the “López” terms were the limit of
                            Colombia’s ability to pay, nevertheless that fact could only with much
                            difficulty be gotten over to the American public who, rightly or
                            wrongly, would compare Colombia’s action with that of other countries,
                            such as those I had mentioned. Therefore, if Colombia were to insist
                            upon the 2 to 3 percent basis, I feared its credit and moral reputation
                            would suffer. Despite his previous remarks as to Colombia’s inability to
                            improve on the “López” terms, the Minister requested me to give him
                            copies of my memoranda comparing Colombia’s fiscal situation with those
                            of Cuba, Uruguay, etc. Enclosed are copies of the memoranda<note n="8" xml:id="d493fn8">Not printed.</note> I delivered to the
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>I then told the Minister that I appreciated the political obstacles in
                            Colombia which made it difficult to improve on the “López” terms, <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0482"/>therefore I submitted a purely
                            personal idea of my own which probably would not appeal to Mr. White,
                            viz: 3 percent interest on the outstanding national debt would amount to
                            $1,350,000 or approximately 2,400,000 pesos per year, or say X
                            percentage of Colombia’s present annual revenue. The “López” proposal
                            could be made more attractive were 3 percent to be a guaranteed minimum,
                            and an additional fillip given by a proviso that if Government revenues
                            increased the <hi rend="italic">bonds</hi> should receive the aforesaid
                            X percentage of those revenues up to a limit of say 5 to 5½ percent on
                            the face value of the bonds. This might in part compensate the
                            bondholder for the low interest rate (3%) stipulated and I felt it
                            should meet with no objections from Congress since that body ought to be
                            willing to pay somewhat more in interest if national income were
                            increased commensurately. The Minister said he had never thought of such
                            a scheme but perhaps it could be put through and it certainly merited
                            study.</p>

                            perhaps the Government guaranteed debt. The Minister replied
                            affirmatively and said immediately the national debt were out of the way
                            then a proposal would be made to each of the Departments and
                            Municipalities that the Federal Government represent them in their
                            respective debt negotiations. The Government would not take over the

                            be paid but it was in a better position to negotiate than were those

                            national debt adjusted first and then was anxious to reach an agreement
                            with that group since it was impossible to continue renewing the loan
                            every three months and he implied that because of the special

                            attitude frequently was embarrassing to the Ambassador whereas Schroeder
                            could serve usefully as a buffer.</p>

                            said I had received a letter dated May 6 from Mr. Warren Pierson,
                            President of the Export-Import Bank of Washington, informing me of an
                            impression prevailing in the United States that Colombia was daily
                            trading in its own bonds. I had understood the only bonds ever acquired
                            by the Colombian Government were the aforementioned $5,997,500 but I
                            would like to be reassured on this point. The Minister emphatically
                            stated that my understanding was correct and Colombia had not and was
                            not now purchasing any of its own securities. I inquired whom he thought
                            was responsible for the activity in the New York Stock Market. He
                            replied that, in the first place, he had recently received a
                            communication from the banking firm of White, Weld and Company of New
                            York stating that there was no great activity in Colombian bonds; but
                            his guess was that while some buyers might be individual Colombian
                            citizens the largest traders were probably a Chicago group comprising
                            among others the firm of Welsh and Green. I thanked the Minister and

                        <p>During the conversation the Minister commented on the large amount of
                            time lost in transmitting information to and from the United States. I
                            inquired whether he thought it would facilitate and speed negotiations
                            were they to be transferred to Bogotá, in which case I observed it would
                            be imperative for Ambassador López, because of his familiarity with what
                            had gone before, to come here with the representative of the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council. The Minister thought that if
                            negotiations were not rapidly concluded in Washington and New York, as
                            he now hoped they would be, then it might be well to bring the

                            officers was the Minister that I drew his attention to the following <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0484"/>points: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The bond owners mostly had small holdings and were unable
                            to protect their own interests; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the houses of
                            issue either could not or would not intervene; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) his knowledge of the methods of some so-called independent
                            committees surely would satisfy him that their participation was not
                            always beneficial; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the only responsible
                            medium left to deal with was the Protective Council but it had to
                            negotiate on bond defaults all over the world, it was paid by voluntary
                            contributions of only ⅛ of 1 percent after a settlement, it therefore
                            lacked funds, perhaps was short of personnel and was continuously
                            subject to criticism from all sides; (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) these
                            considerations placed the Colombian Government under a greater moral
                            obligation than perhaps it would be otherwise. In short, while he might
                            have been annoyed by the Council he should in all fairness make
                            allowance for the impediments it had to overcome and above everything he
                            should remember that it was absolutely honest and its officers stood to
                            make no personal gain irrespective of the settlements put through. Dr.
                            Lleras said he was glad to learn these details and he had always been

                            approximately 17,500,000 pesos had been reduced in November 1938 to
                            approximately 1,500,000 pesos. The difference was the profit made from
                            the stabilization of the currency and had been used to cancel an
                            8,000,000 peso indebtedness to the Banco de la República, for public

                            restrictions was vitally important in connection with countries, such as
                            Germany, having compensation agreements. The Minister agreed with me on
                            this. I then told him I did not understand how and why Germany was now
                            getting certain free exchange, amounting to approximately $125,000 per
                            month, beyond the amounts contemplated in the renewal (December 1, 1938)
                            of the German-Colombian agreement of May 21, 1937. I understood this
                            special free exchange for Germans was covered by an informal interchange
                            of notes, supplementing the aforesaid renewal of agreement. I was not
                            making any formal protest but it did seem a bit severe on Americans,
                            operating in Colombia, to have the Germans receive this preference. (It
                            should be noted that Mr. Wright of this Embassy repeatedly has tried to
                            get copies of the aforesaid notes from Señor Bayón of the Exchange
                            Control Office who in each instance refused his request.) Dr. Lleras was
                            unaware of this situation, although he said that Mr. <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0485"/>Smith of the National City Bank had
                            told him some time ago that the Germans were receiving certain
                            preferences over the United States but he had given no concrete
                            supporting facts. Dr. Lleras asked me for a copy of the memorandum on
                            this subject, which he noticed I had with me, and said he would
                            communicate the results of his investigations to me. Copy of the
                            memorandum sent to the Minister is enclosed.<note n="11" xml:id="d493fn11">Not printed.</note>

                            to us because, since its enactment the latter’s favorable balance had
                            been reduced from $30,000,000 to $4,000,000. I replied that we were not
                            so much interested in whether balances were favorable or otherwise as we
                            were in extending and freeing commerce in all directions and in
                            eliminating harmful restrictions such as were involved in compensation
                            arrangements. In this connection I pointed out that in 1938 the United
                            States had absorbed 53.6 percent of Colombia’s exports but had only
                            participated in 48.8 percent of her imports, thus creating free exchange
                            for this country; whereas the corresponding figures for Germany were
                            13.7 percent and 17.5 percent. I said I was not complaining but simply
                            calling the facts to his attention.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lleras said that aside from preventing the Germans from swamping this
                            market there were three factors to be considered when removing exchange
                            control: <list>

                                <item>In recent years an important textile manufacturing business,
                                    protected by the import quota restrictions of exchange control,
                                    had grown up here largely in Antioquia. This industry had a
                                    peculiar attraction for the Colombians who would not wish to see
                                    it injured. If exchange control were lifted, cotton piece goods
                                    (yarns?) might flow into this country from the United States in
                                    such volume as to damage or perhaps destroy this business.
                                    Therefore, could the Colombian trade agreement with the United
                                    States be modified to meet this contingency? I told him it was a
                                    matter requiring careful study. I would report to the State
                                    Department and inform him in due course of my Government’s
                                    reaction to this suggestion.</item>

                                <item>Colombia’s economic strength probably would enable its
                                    currency to withstand the removal of exchange control,
                                    nevertheless some additional backing for the currency would be
                                    reassuring. Dr. Lleras recalled that I had spoken to President
                                    Santos concerning a possible loan of gold bullion for
                                    stabilization purposes, once the debt was settled. He believed
                                    such a loan to the Bank of the Republic would be valuable second
                                    line of defense for Colombian currency. He did <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0486"/>not feel our agreement with
                                    Brazil was particularly applicable to Colombia. Would I please
                                    consider and advise him what could be done along these lines.
                                    This I promised to do, also telling him it must necessarily be
                                    consulted with both the State and Treasury Departments. I said
                                    any gold bullion loan would have to be from Treasury to Treasury
                                    and I understood while the Brazilian program had met with very
                                    wide approval nevertheless congressional authorization was
                                    required to put it in effect.</item>

                        <p>I would appreciate receiving the Department’s instructions in respect to

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Export-Import Bank Financing</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>Mention of the Brazilian agreement led to discussion of what assistance
                            might be given to Colombia by the Export-Import Bank. I told the
                            Minister that as in the case of a bullion loan nothing could be done
                            until a debt adjustment was pretty well assured. Dr. Lleras said
                            Colombia urgently needed financial assistance from the Export-Import
                            Bank or from some other source in order to purchase material for the
                            construction of railroads, including rolling stock, road-making
                            machinery and dredges to keep the channels of the Magdalena River clear.
                            Unless financing were obtained, Colombia would have to go without many
                            essential improvements or overburden the budget by paying for the
                            equipment in one or two years. Hence, Export-Import Bank financing would
                            give Colombia greater leeway and thus permit her safely to do away with
                            exchange control.</p>
                        <p>The Minister impressed upon me that even more vital than the foregoing
                            was the adequate and sound financing of the Agricultural Credit Bank.
                            That institution had already discounted with the Bank of the Republic
                            thirteen and a half million pesos of the permissible legal maximum of
                            sixteen million pesos. Of course the discount limitations could be
                            raised by law, but he considered it unsound to do so. The proper
                            solution was to increase the Agricultural Credit Bank’s capital by
                            approximately $3,000,000. The development of this enterprise was a
                            paramount issue and there was no place where our assistance would be
                            more appreciated by both the Colombian Government and people. To raise
                            three million dollars from the budget would be too great a sacrifice,
                            particularly if a debt agreement were reached. He earnestly hoped this
                            additional capital for the bank could be financed by the Export-Import
                            Bank and the Colombian Government would itself willingly assume the
                            indebtedness as a direct obligation.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Minister, I said that once the debt was adjusted I hoped
                            the Export-Import Bank could help with the financing of purchases of
                            railway equipment, road machinery, dredges, etc., but that a direct
                            investment in the Agricultural Credit Bank I feared might be impossible.
                            However, I would be very glad to give the matter consideration and
                            submit it to my Government for study to determine <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0487"/>whether through financial assistance
                            given to the Colombian Government it in turn could make the investment
                            in the Agricultural Credit Bank. The Department’s views on this would be
                            appreciated.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Coastguard Reorganization</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>Dr. Lleras said still another most important manner in which we could
                            materially assist Colombia was in the reorganization of their coastguard
                            service. Some years ago they bought in the United States a couple of
                            secondhand coastguard cutters, which were antiquated, inefficient, and
                            now required expensive repairs. The amount of smuggling along both the
                            Atlantic and Pacific coasts in Colombia was scandalous. Contraband of
                            all kinds was being run into the country, particularly silk and other
                            goods from Japan. To stop this illicit traffic required four or five
                            good cutters which would cost, he believed, about seven to eight hundred
                            thousand dollars. The prevention of smuggling and the resultant
                            collection of customs duties probably in time would finance the purchase
                            of these vessels. Of equal importance, however, was the matter of
                            national security. He said I, of course, was familiar with the rumors
                            concerning alien activities along the Colombian coast (see my despatch
                            No. 75 of April 21, 1939)<note n="13" xml:id="d493fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> and particularly if war were to occur in Europe the
                            operation of these new cutters would be of value not only to Colombia
                            but to the United States. He had discussed the matter with the Minister
                            of War who agreed that a complete study and reorganization of the
                            coastguard must be made, attention being given to personnel, purchase of
                            vessels and other equipment and establishment of a base at Cartagena,
                            including drydock facilities for the cutters. Quotations on cutters had
                            been received from Holland and Germany but since the Colombians were so
                            inexperienced in the matter it would be best for the job to be handled
                            by American experts. The Minister had written to Ambassador López in a
                            preliminary way requesting him to investigate what might be done but as
                            yet had received no reply. He would write again and hoped this matter
                            would be considered favorably by the United States Government.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>Our conversation ended by both of us agreeing to think over the various
                            points and to get together frequently for discussions thereof. In these
                            talks I shall continue to argue in favor of a settlement which will
                            reestablish Colombia’s good name and credit.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lleras gives the impression of being bright, able, honest and
                            possessing good judgment, especially for so young a man. In offering
                            such a sorry prospect for a settlement satisfactory to the bondholders,
                            the Minister, partially as trading strategy, is painting the <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0488"/>gloomiest picture. But the fact remains
                            that the long standing default, the inexpert handling of the matter in
                            the past, favorable economic and credit developments here (see my
                            despatch No. 66 of April 17, 1939)<note n="14" xml:id="d493fn14">Not
                                printed.</note> and internal political influences, all indicate that
                            any substantial improvement over the “López” terms can only be
                            accomplished through the most skillful and intensive efforts. Public
                            and, what is far more important, political sentiment has, as was only to
                            be expected, during the years of default crystallized in favor of a
                            settlement no better than that offered by President López. Even if the
                            Colombian Ambassador and other negotiators become convinced that a
                            higher interest rate should be accepted, it is presently doubtful that
                            the administration would dare support or Congress ratify a settlement on
                            a substantially better basis. We may rail at their incomprehension and
                            even at their Punic faith, but at least an equal share of responsibility
                            for this unhappy situation rests in the United States and their attitude
                            is in line with common experience in governmental debt settlements.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, it is well to face the hard facts that: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) If debt service is not renewed this year on some basis,
                            Colombia may continue to default more or less indefinitely; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) an agreement certainly can now be made on the
                            “López”, or perhaps somewhat better, terms. A bad adjustment is better
                            than none at all. For the bondholders to have 3 percent in hand is
                            preferable to speculating on receiving a higher rate in some
                            indeterminate future, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Hence it is the part of
                            wisdom to make the best deal possible for the bondholders—it will in any
                            case be superior to the Chilean offer—and then get on to the new
                            business of reinforcing both our economic and political standing and
                            prestige in Colombia. The financial assistance we may give to this
                            country will in some measure redound to the benefit of the bondholders.
                            To pursue any other course, as indicated in my despatch No. 66, would be
                            somewhat in the nature of biting off our nose to spite our face.</p>
                        <p>Of course, in my conversations here I have not even hinted at the
                            foregoing; on the contrary I have, if anything, played up the
                            consequences to Colombia’s good name and economy of a failure to agree
                            on better terms.</p>
                        <p>This country so ardently desires our assistance on stabilization,
                            financing, the Agricultural Credit Bank, coastguard service, etc., that
                            it would be good strategy for conversations on these matters to proceed
                            simultaneously with the debt negotiations. These elements may be
                            utilized as effective trading arguments by which, with no sacrifice to
                            the United States Treasury or the Export-Import Bank, the Colombians may
                            be induced to agree to a better bargain for the bondholders. The
                            advantages obtained might also perhaps lead the Colombian Congress to

                        <p>42. Finance Minister last night told me that while Francis White appeared
                            less <hi rend="italic">intransigeant</hi> than previously debt
                            negotiations now appear to be in doldrums and he wanted my assistance to
                            stimulate action so that service may be agreed upon and included in
                            budget to be presented to Congress July 20. (Indications are that
                            Government also desires to present project to Congress looking to
                            removal of exchange control.) Minister is dining with me July 8 and I
                            may have discussion earlier. Therefore would appreciate being informed
                            status of negotiations, specific points on which I may perhaps be
                            helpful, and answers to questions raised in my despatch No. 117, of May

                        <p>56. Your 42, June 29, 1 p.m. The Colombian Ambassador presented a
                            comprehensive memorandum<note n="15" xml:id="d495fn15">Not
                                printed.</note> to the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council
                            incorporating the so-called López offer and Mr. White in a conversation
                            with the Ambassador on June 16<note n="16" xml:id="d495fn16">Memorandum
                                of conversation not printed.</note> indicated that the offer was
                            very low in view of Colombia’s financial position and the higher service
                            on internal issues. The Ambassador said he would refer Mr. White’s views
                            to his Government, and the Council is apparently awaiting a reply which
                            it hopes will contain a better offer. A copy of the Colombian memorandum
                            and of a memorandum of Mr. White’s conversation were sent to you in the
                            air mail pouch which should have reached you yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Although the Department has not made a careful analysis of Colombian
                            finances, it recognizes the weight of some of the considerations <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0490"/>raised by the Council and
                            therefore very earnestly hopes that the Colombian Government will give
                            them a most thorough consideration. If suitable occasion arises at your
                            dinner on July 8, you may, in your discretion, express to the Minister
                            your hope that in view of his detailed knowledge of the whole situation
                            he will be able to find opportunity personally to study the Council’s
                            observations in order that he may arrive at his own conclusions
                            uninfluenced by the opinions of others who do not recognize as he does
                            the desirability of settling the debt default as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Department has no indication of what interest rate the Council might
                            be willing to accept, and believes that it would be preferable at this
                            stage for no suggestion to be made by you even on your own
                            responsibility as to what would be reasonable and fair.</p>
                        <p>For your information the Department has been informed that in order to
                            overcome one of the Council’s objections the Colombian Ambassador has
                            advised his Government to consider the possibility of a reduction in the
                            rate of interest on internal bonds proportionate to that proposed on the
                            external bonds.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Minister’s reference to the Chilean debt settlement,
                            as set forth in your despatch no. 117, you may find it desirable to
                            emphasize that as a result of subsequent negotiations of the Chilean
                            Government with the Council and the formal assurances given the latter
                            as to the scope of the law, and in recognition of the appreciable
                            payments being made by Chile under difficult economic conditions, the
                            Council withdrew its recommendation against acceptance of the Chilean
                            proposal. The amount paid by Chile for service on its foreign debt alone
                            in 1938 was 22 percent of the national budget, half of which was
                            allocated for interest payments.</p>
                        <p>With further reference to your despatch no. 117, there has recently been
                            under reconsideration the policy which the Export-Import Bank should
                            pursue in relation to the extension of credit to governments in default
                            on their external indebtedness. You will be informed as soon as decision
                            has been reached.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, if you feel you must make reply to the questions posed
                            by the Minister of Finance as conveyed to the Department in despatch no.
                            117, you may say that a gold bullion loan would require specific
                            congressional authorization as indicated in the Brazilian arrangements.
                            There has been no occasion as yet to submit that question to Congress
                            for action since as yet no request has been received from Brazil. Since
                            the Colombian Minister of Finance indicates that he regards the proposal
                            made to Brazil as not particularly applicable to Colombia, this
                            Government might be prepared to consider any counter suggestion from him
                            as to exchange facilities such as advancing dollars against gold
                            collateral.</p>
                        <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0491"/>
                        <p>The credits granted by the Export-Import Bank must be for the purposes of
                            facilitating United States export or import trade, and it would appear
                            difficult to justify an extension of credit by the Bank to the
                            Agricultural Credit Bank of Colombia which would be regarded as a
                            capital increase (the Bank is specifically forbidden to purchase
                            stock).</p>
                        <p>The Department will instruct you further with respect to the remarks of
                            President Santos and the Minister of Finance regarding cotton goods in
                            connection with the trade agreement.</p>

                        <p>47. Department’s No. 56, July 1, 3 p.m. In conversations Saturday and 3
                            hours yesterday with Minister of Finance I strictly adhered to
                            instructions and net of discussion was: Minister of Finance still
                            anxious for speedy settlement believing Congress within a month from its
                            opening will become so involved in political bickering as to make
                            approval extremely difficult. He inquired to which of consideration[s]
                            raised by the Council the Department gave [apparent omission]. I told
                            him I do not know and I only pointed to those which appealed to me
                            personally. The most encouraging feature of the conversation was that he
                            several times expressed desire to know what rate would reestablish
                            Colombia’s credit so that he might come as closely as possible to it.
                            However, in contradiction to this, when White’s reference to Uruguayan
                                settlement<note n="17" xml:id="d496fn17">See Foreign Bondholders
                                Protective Council, Inc., <hi rend="italic">Annual Report 1989</hi>,
                                p. 62.</note> was discussed he said Colombia could not come anywhere
                            near 4½ per cent. Also Colombia having made best possible offer under
                            present fiscal conditions could not with dignity alter same; to do so
                            would be politically embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>On July 5 he sent air mail letter to Colombian Ambassador at Washington
                            answering various points raised by White and instructing that offer be
                            renewed.</p>
                        <p>He asked me what would be effect of this. I told him probably they would
                            get nowhere; in fact I was disappointed to see both sides involved in a
                            protracted discussion of factors which had been thoroughly reviewed, the
                            essence of the problem was for them rapidly to get together across the
                            table on a rate which would reestablish Colombia’s credit and make
                            possible Council’s approval. I suggested in view of his desire for rapid
                            settlement perhaps best procedure might be for <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0492"/>him to abandon trading tactics and
                            forthwith to make maximum offer Colombia could contemplate. He replied
                            this was inexpedient course politically and said only procedure was for
                            White to dress up present offer leaving essentials the same as now. The
                            only concrete proposal he could think of in this connection was for
                            payments reached in fifth year to be continued thereafter until
                            extinguishment of debt. He would not consider making present apply for
                            temporary settlement. When I pressed for other suggestions of [<hi rend="italic">to?</hi>] make “dressing up” worthwhile he replied it
                            was up to White to use imagination. I said that imagination would have
                            to come from this end.</p>
                        <p>He was evidently concerned by my insistence offer would have to be
                            improved and that action was up to him and not to expect counter offer
                            from White. He promised matter would have his preferential attention, it
                            was most important subject before him and Government was extremely
                            anxious to have it settled.</p>
                        <p>To meet charge of discrimination Colombian Ambassador had suggested
                            giving option foreign bondholders to convert into internal issues. The
                            Minister agreed with me that this did not merit much consideration.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question he said Ambassador at Washington was authorized
                            to declare that English and American bondholders would receive identical
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>Minister again brought up gold bullion loan and when I explained
                            situation to him he inquired whether it would be possible once debt was
                            adjusted and Colombia returned to free exchange (always controlling
                            compensation countries through import restrictions) for Bank of Republic
                            to obtain loan from Federal Reserve Bank which possibly would be little
                            used but mere existence thereof would insure stability of exchange. He
                            also again emphasized urgent necessity of acting on cotton goods in
                            connection with trade agreement. I told him I would reply on these
                            points when instructed by the Department. He promised to keep me posted
                            of any communication from Ambassador at Washington and I said I would
                            also keep in touch with him.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, Minister of Finance is torn between desire for settlement
                            with Council, fear of political repercussions here. He is still trading
                            but can be induced to improve offer somewhat but I fear not enough to
                            satisfy White.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 47 of July 11, 5 p.m., and to submit the following additional
                            information on my <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0493"/>conversations
                            with the Colombian Minister of Finance on July 8 and 10:</p>
                           <p>1. The Minister asked what I thought of the Colombian
                                        memorandum as submitted to the Foreign Bondholders
                                        Protective Council, Inc. I told him my personal reaction
                                        thereto was that the Colombian argument frequently overshot
                                        the mark by attemping to prove too much; for instance, the
                                        statement that depreciation of the peso makes full renewal
                                        of the debt service “impossible” is an exaggeration, the
                                        word “difficult” would have been more accurate. Mr. White, I
                                        believed, had made some pertinent observations to Ambassador
                                        López with respect to the memorandum throughout
                                        over-emphasizing comparison of the country’s fiscal position
                                        between 1929 and 1938.</p>
                                    <p>I said that, while admittedly it is extremely difficult, with
                                        statistics available, to make an accurate estimate for
                                        Colombia of the balance of payments and perhaps no two
                                        people would arrive at the same conclusion, nevertheless the
                                        memorandum’s arguments respecting balance of payments lose
                                        force in face of the fact, generally accepted in Bogota
                                        banking circles, that Colombia has had difficulty during the
                                        last month or so in keeping the value of the peso down. In
                                        this connection, I said I could not agree with the Colombian
                                        thesis of excluding all exports of petroleum, 40 percent of
                                        bananas, and platinum. While Mr. White is inaccurate when he
                                        says the exploitation of oil has been proceeding at a
                                        tremendous rate and that the first oil has been brought
                                        through the pipe line from the Barco concession during the
                                        last two or three months, the Colombians are equally in
                                        error when they exclude the substantial benefits to this
                                        country received from the Tropical Oil Company in wages,
                                        local purchases, taxes, etc., plus the few millions being
                                        spent annually on exploration. The Minister admitted that I
                                        was right but remarked that Tropical purchases in the
                                        country about balanced their local sales.</p>
                                <p>2. Dr. Lleras said, for a while, the peso had tended to rise
                                    against the dollar but now the reverse was true, as was proven
                                    by the recent drop in gold reserves to a ratio of 60 percent
                                    (60.52 percent as of June 27). The legal minimum was 50 percent,
                                    the banks had done little rediscounting but might do so at any
                                    time, in which event if exchange control had been removed the
                                    peso would be under severe pressure, at least for some months.
                                    He then made his suggestion regarding a stabilization loan from
                                    the Federal Reserve Bank, as described in my cable under
                                    reference. It may be observed that the recent drop in gold
                                    reserves is perennial and due to the off-season in coffee
                                    shipments; gold reserves as of July 8 are back to 62.7.</p>
                                <p>3. The Minister said he already had a project drafted looking to
                                    the removal of exchange control. In this connection he observed
                                    that Mr. White seemed to forget that the National Government
                                    could not agree to such a high rate of service as would absorb
                                    all available exchange and leave none for the service on loans
                                    by departmental and other debtors.</p>
                                <p>4. The Minister told me of a letter he had received from
                                    Ambassador López describing the conversation with Mr. White on
                                    June 16. This account approximately paralleled the memorandum
                                    enclosed with the Department’s instruction No. 51 of June 14,
                                        1939.<note n="18" xml:id="d497fn18">Not
                                    printed.</note>
                        </p>
                                <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0494"/>
                                <p>5. I told the Minister that the points raised by Mr. White which
                                    appealed to me were: <list>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>Discrimination as between external and internal
                                            bonds;</item>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>Percentage of budgets devoted by other countries to
                                            foreign debt service. I emphasized to him that even in
                                            Chile 22 percent of the 1938 budget had been paid to
                                            foreign bondholders;</item>
                                        <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                        <item>The purchase of the Belgian Railroad.</item>
                                    </list>
                        </p>
                           <p>6. On (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), Dr. Lleras held there had
                                        been no discrimination, since the internal loans had been
                                        contracted under duress, somfc of them even without any
                                        interest, and the largest one had been liquidated largely by
                                        means of a special tax on gasoline, which was oppressive and
                                        could not be continued for too long a period. Despite the
                                        Minister’s explanation, this tax still is effective and a
                                        fair guess is that it will be continued. He made no mention
                                        of Ambassador López’ suggestion that rate of interest on
                                        internal bonds be reduced to a figure proportionate to the
                                        external. Therefore, I inquired whether this had been
                                        considered. He replied affirmatively and said it had been
                                        done in the past by means of an arbitrary tax but he thought
                                        there were only one or two issues on which it could now be
                                        done and that it would do little good.</p>
                                    <p>With respect to (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the Minister
                                        offered no counter argument except that other essential
                                        items on the budget simply could not be cut nor eliminated
                                        to a degree which would permit of such high percentages as
                                        some other countries devoted to debt service. He had already
                                        cut next year’s budget by 30,000,000 pesos. In my opinion,
                                        it is perfectly true that this country could, at this
                                        particular juncture of its economic development, soundly and
                                        beneficially spend a budget augmented in this amount.</p>
                                    <p>He said (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the purchase of the
                                        Belgian Railroad was forced on the Government as otherwise
                                        operations thereof would have ceased and an impossible
                                        situation would have been created for the
                                    Government.</p>
                        <p>7. I inquired whether the Minister had further considered my
                                    purely personal suggestion (described in last paragraph of Page
                                    9 of my despatch No. 117 of May 15, 1939)<note n="19" xml:id="d497fn19">See third paragraph under the heading: “My
                                        Opinion of Terms”, p. 472.</note> regarding an X percentage
                                    of the budget being allocated to foreign debt service. He
                                    replied that it would be impossible to apply an X percentage to
                                    the entire budget but it might be done with certain specific
                                    items of revenue and thus give the bondholders a chance for an
                                    increase in payments.</p>
                                <p>8. The Minister was pleased with the advance being made on the
                                    question of revenue cutters, appreciated the assistance already
                                    given in Washington, and hoped a satisfactory combined service
                                    for both coast guard and auxiliary naval defense would be
                                    consummated.</p>
                                <p>9. He regretted that the Export-Import Bank could not assist in
                                    the financing of the Agricultural Credit Bank but understood our
                                    position thereon.</p>
                                <p>10. My observations on the Colombian memorandum Dr. Lleras took in
                                    good stead as he did my remarks supporting certain of Mr.
                                    White’s arguments. In short, I think he genuinely desires a
                                    settlement but simply does not know how to overcome the
                                    practical and political obstacles which make it extremely
                                    difficult for the Santos administration appreciably to better
                                    the so-called “López terms.”</p>

                            above other than to say that it contains several mistakes as for
                            instance when he speaks of Colombian bonds selling on the New York
                            market at 15 cents on the dollar, whereas the price on June 9 was
                            actually 27½ with, a low for the year of 19¾. Also, Mr. White apparently
                            confuses the balance of trade with the balance of payments. In this
                            connection I enclose an analysis of the latter<note n="20" xml:id="d497fn2">Not printed.</note> prepared by the National City

                            memorandum may give the Department a somewhat closer approximation to
                            the real situation.</p>
                        <p>Of course an adequate discussion of the arguments by both sides on many
                            phases of the situation is necessary. However, the whole situation has
                            been pretty thoroughly examined during the last few years so that each
                            party is already well acquainted with the other’s views. Hence it should
                            now be possible to shorten the conversations which otherwise may be
                            time-consuming and will not greatly clarify the issues since both will
                            more or less rigidly adhere to their particular theses.</p>
                        <p>The one point, above all others, to which a solution must be found is how
                            much can and will the Colombians increase their proposal above the
                            so-called “López terms” stipulated in their memorandum and at what rate
                            will the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc. give its approval
                            to those terms. This is a question which it should be possible to settle
                            within a few days at the most. It is generally admitted here that the
                            Colombian offer of the “López terms” was made on a trading basis in
                            order to bring forth a counter offer from the Council. The negotiation
                            on this one point can be done back and forth across the table rapidly if
                            the issue is not confused by such issues as Mr. White (bottom of Page 6
                            of his June 9 memorandum) insisting that the municipal and departmental
                            debts be adjusted simultaneously with the national debt. In this
                            connection I beg to refer to the last eight lines on page 5 of my
                            despatch No. 117 of May 15, 1939<note n="21" xml:id="d497fn21">Reference
                                is to the last 7 lines, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_471">p. 471</ref>.</note> and to suggest that it
                            would be advisable for Mr. White to urge that in all allotments of
                            national income to subsidiary governmental units at least a portion be
                            earmarked for foreign debt service.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the interests of the bondholders have already suffered
                            because of the many avoidable delays permitted during the past couple of
                            years. To allow further procrastination now would be inexcusable and
                            will still more injure the bondholders.</p>

                        <p>66. White of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council has informed
                            Department that on July 13 Ambassador Miguel López informed him under
                            instructions that the debt proposal submitted about June 15 was the best
                            that Colombia could offer at this time. White informed López that he
                            could not recommend to the Executive Committee of the Council that it
                            recommend the proposed settlement to the bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador again brought up the possibility of refunding the internal
                            issues. White said that he was prepared to recommend to his Executive
                            Committee a proposal for a 1-year temporary settlement with a 3 percent
                            interest rate, the year to be used by the Colombians to refund its
                            internal bonds at lower interest rates. At the end of the year further
                            negotiations would be carried on for a definitive debt settlement for
                            the external debt at higher interest rates that would take into account
                            the savings to the Colombian Government because of the lower interest on
                            the internal issues. White does not think the Colombian Government will
                            be interested in this idea.</p>
                        <p>White also suggested for consideration the possibility of making
                            increases in debt service contingent on increase in the Colombian
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Miguel López stated that he would cable his Government a résumé of their
                            conversation and request new instructions.</p>
                        <p>White believes that Miguel López was seeing him for purpose of feeling
                            out how low an interest rate would be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information and not to be in any way
                            communicated to the Colombian Government, White states that he is
                            preparing a proposal that he will place before the Executive Committee
                            next Tuesday. If the Executive Committee approves he will present it to
                            the Colombian Ambassador the next time López gets in touch with him.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 66 of July 15, 5 p.m. and to report that
                            pursuant to my request the Minister of Finance, Dr. Lleras Restrepo,
                            received me yesterday afternoon and read to me a cable he had just had
                            from the Colombian Ambassador in Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>This message, although somewhat longer, approximated the information
                            contained in the Department’s telegram under reference, except that the
                            Ambassador interpreted Mr. White’s refusal to recommend the Colombian
                            proposal to the Council’s Executive Committeee as a definite rejection
                            thereof. He added that Mr. Laylin,<note n="24" xml:id="d499fn24">John G.
                                Laylin, Washington attorney, acting as counsel to the Colombian
                                Ambassador.</note> who also was present at the meeting, inquired
                            whether Mr. White would recommend a settlement on a 3½ percent basis.
                            Mr. White said he would not and that moreover he objected to further
                            questioning along this line since it would commit him—something he could
                            not accept since he was acting without authority from the bondholders.
                            The Ambassador quoted Mr. White as declaring that the Colombian offer
                            was incommensurate with present capacity to pay and still more with
                            future prospects. In this latter connection, he had particularly
                            stressed the development by American capital of the petroleum industry
                            in Colombia. Mr. Laylin’s inquiry regarding 3½ percent is, of course,
                            significant.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lleras said that he had been so discouraged by the Ambassador’s
                            telegram as almost to reply that nothing else remained to be done with
                            the Council and that the Colombian Government would seek other methods,
                            than through that organization, of dealing with the bondholders.
                            However, just then he received my request for an interview and he hoped
                            I would have some more encouraging information.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said Mr. White’s rejection of the Colombian offer made it
                            impossible for the Government to make another, i. e., presumably through
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council. Also it prevented his
                            including any item for debt service in the budget since it would become
                            generally known that the Colombian offer had been rejected. When I
                            doubted this, he insisted that everything was known in Bogota within
                            twenty-four hours, which, I must say, is largely true. He frankly
                            expressed his discouragement because it was evidently impossible by the
                            present method of negotiation to reach a conclusion since Mr. White
                            “assumed the dual role of negotiator and non-negotiator, that is, he
                            took all of the advantages of a negotiator but none of the obligations,
                            which placed the Government at a serious disadvantage—it was futile to
                            continue discussions with White”. I indicated that Mr. White had not
                            “rejected” but merely “refused to approve”. But the Minister insisted
                            another offer could not be made.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question, Dr. Lleras stated that Mr. White’s suggestion to
                            make the offer a temporary one for one year was utterly unacceptable.
                            Also he had requested Ambassador López and his financial advisers to
                            submit a plan looking to the refunding of Colombia’s <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0498"/>internal issues. This they had done but
                            the Minister was now satisfied that the thought of refunding internal
                            issues should be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>The Minister asked what information I had. I replied that unfortunately
                            it was similar but even more brief than his, although I was encouraged
                            by one factor: I understood Mr. White was disposed perhaps to consider
                            the possibility of making increases in debt service contingent on
                            increases in the Colombian budget. I added that since the Minister
                            thought it unwise to follow my suggestion (see Section 7, Page 5, of my
                            despatch No. 206 of July 13, 1939) of an X percentage of the budget
                            being assigned to debt service, he might do so with an X percentage of
                            revenues (both royalties and taxes) received from the petroleum
                            industry. I pointed out that, while large sums were being spent on
                            exploration, there was as yet no guarantee that these operations would
                            be successful nor that Colombia would receive any substantial additional
                            income from this source. Nevertheless it was a possibility with which
                            Mr. White was impressed, according to the Ambassador’s cable, and by
                            such an arrangement the bondholders would receive a speculative fillip
                            which might compensate thtoi for a somewhat lower return than otherwise
                            they would be willing to accept, also it would answer Mr. White’s
                            arguments respecting Colombia’s ability to augment future payments. The
                            Minister estimated that approximately 12 to 14 percent of the revenues
                            presently received from the oil industry are equivalent to 1 percent on
                            the debt service. He calculated that the earmarking of 15 percent of oil
                            revenues to debt service might in a few years give the bondholders a
                            substantial increase in interest but felt in any case they should be
                            limited to the 4½ percent rate received by the holders of Uruguayan
                            securities. I replied that I could not discuss the details of such a
                            plan and had merely stated my personal opinion as favoring it in
                            principle. But he should bear in mind that the Uruguayan bondowners were
                            assured of a minimum of 4½ percent and moreover had received interest at
                            that rate for some time past; therefore, I felt if the Colombian
                            bondholders were to be asked to take any less, they should be
                            compensated by the possibility of receiving a higher rate if the oil
                            industry developed as we all hoped it would. Also I could not believe he
                            would encounter much opposition in Congress on such a plan because in
                            the final analysis Colombia would benefit even more than the bondholders
                            from the development of the petroleum industry since, aside from local
                            wages and purchases, if his figure were taken, 85 percent of the
                            additional government income would be retained here. Dr. Lleras was
                            receptive to this idea, which may therefore be pursued to advantage by
                            Mr. White.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lleras went on to say that by law he was obliged to submit the budget
                            to Congress within ten days from its opening. He was now <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0499"/>estopped, as described above, from
                            including an item for foreign debt service and if it were not in the
                            budget it would be extremely difficult later to reopen the budget in
                            order to insert a special appropriation.</p>
                        <p>I observed that, according to his statements and excepting for the
                            possibility of an X percentage of petroleum revenues being assigned to
                            the debt service, apparently an impasse had been reached. This gravely
                            concerned me as being highly unfortunate both for Colombian good name
                            and credit and for the bondholders. Therefore, pursuant to his
                            suggestion of last week that imagination be used, I begged him to put on
                            his thinking cap and exercise the maximum of imagination to resolve the
                            impasse.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that in the final analysis Mr. White would be in
                            none too good a position when it became known to the bondholders that he
                            had rejected a Colombian offer without making any constructive counter
                            suggestions. I warned the Minister he should not count on Mr. White’s
                            being embarrassed thereby as it would only appear to the bondholders and
                            in the financial press in the United States that Colombia had made an
                            offer which had been refused approval by the Council because it was not
                            commensurate with this country’s ability to pay and compared unfavorably
                            with debt settlements reached with others. Dr. Lleras said a similar
                            situation had existed respecting Chile’s unilateral offer but
                            subsequently based on insignificant changes in the Chilean undertaking
                            Mr. White had been forced to give his approval in order not to appear,
                            alone, as disapproving the Chilean offer which the bondholders
                            themselves were by then ready to accept. I again mentioned the fact that
                            Chile in 1938 at least devoted 22 percent of its budget to foreign debt
                            service, to which Dr. Lleras rejoined that as soon as the departments
                            and other Colombian debtors began servicing their loans the percentage
                            of total budgets would be comparable to Chile’s. I observed that this
                            was perhaps a subject we could discuss more intelligently when we knew
                            exactly what the total service was to be.</p>
                        <p>When I again insisted that the Minister make some suggestion as to how
                            the present impasse might be solved, he replied that it would be helpful
                            if he could obtain, in some way, an indication as to what interest rate
                            would be approved by the Council. I said I did not see how this would
                            greatly assist him since, judging by his remarks, he still seemed to be
                            pretty far away in his ideas from a figure which the Council would
                            approve.</p>
                        <p>At one point I inquired whether there would be any advantage in
                            Ambassador López and Mr. White coming to Colombia since the members of
                            the debt commission, and of the Senate and House Committees, and other
                            influential people might thereby obtain a better understanding of the
                            situation as it existed in the United States and in turn Mr. White would
                            sense the atmosphere here. The Minister <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0500"/>agreed my reasoning was sound but said there were other
                            considerations why it would be unwise for the negotiations to be
                            transferred to Bogota. While of course I did not mention it to the
                            Minister, one disadvantage of negotiating in the States is illustrated
                            by the fact that while Messrs. López and White continued to discuss the
                            refunding of internal bonds that subject never was very seriously
                            considered by the Government here.</p>
                        <p>While I am satisfied it would be extremely difficult for the Colombian
                            Government to include the departmental, municipal and bank debts in a
                            settlement along with the national debt, I nevertheless asked the
                            Minister whether by doing so it would not be possible to make a proposal
                            on better terms than the one already submitted. This suggestion he
                            rejected.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted from the foregoing that so far about the only point
                            which appears encouraging is the X percentage of petroleum revenues
                            being assigned to debt service. Several times throughout the interview I
                            emphasized that Colombia’s credit would be seriously damaged with
                            consequent embarrassment to all concerned if the Government left matters
                            in the present impasse. I believe the Minister was impressed by my
                            argument, but unfortunately not enough so to induce him to make another
                            offer on terms anywhere near acceptable to the Council. I would feel
                            more sanguine about my possibly bringing the matter to the attention of
                            President Santos had he not already admitted to me that he knew little
                            about finance and relied entirely therefore on his Minister.</p>
                        <p>Our interview ended by my urging that Dr. Lleras give serious thought to
                            the finding of a solution to the impasse and by his promising to call a
                            special meeting of the Debt Commission this week to consider the
                            situation, after which he would advise me of what conclusions had been
                            reached by the Commission and himself.</p>
                        <p>I shall, of course, appreciate being informed promptly of Mr. White’s
                            proposal, mentioned in the last paragraph of the Department’s telegram
                            under reference. It may at least, I hope, be of such a nature as to
                            silence Dr. Lleras’ criticism respecting Mr. White’s dual role. Of
                            course the ideal would be for it to be along the same general lines as
                            the Colombian offer and with an interest rate within trading range of
                            the Colombian.</p>

                        <p>68. Personal. From the Under Secretary.<note n="25" xml:id="d500fn25">Sumner Welles.</note> The Colombian Ambassador today came to see me
                            to state that he had been informed by his <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0501"/>Government that at an official interview requested by
                            you yesterday you had informed the Minister of Finance that this
                            Government did not consider that the proposal submitted by the Colombian
                            Government for the settlement of the debt default was satisfactory. It
                            was said that you went on to mention various ways, including the levying
                            of certain new taxes, by which the Colombian proposal might be
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>In view of the opening of the Colombian Congress tomorrow and of the
                            knowledge in informed quarters of your visit to the Minister of Finance
                            in his office, the Ambassador stated his Government was extremely
                            perturbed that the supposition might arise that the United States
                            Government was injecting itself into the debt discussion and exercising
                            pressure for better terms. This would introduce great complications into
                            the negotiations, making it much more difficult for the Government to
                            negotiate an equitable settlement.</p>
                        <p>In commenting upon the Ambassador’s statements, I informed him as
                            follows: First of all, as I had explained to him many times and to Dr.
                            Santos when he passed through Washington prior to his participation in
                            the presidential elections, it has consistently been the policy of this
                            Government not to interject or involve itself in the negotiations
                            between governmental entities and the bondholders, its activities being
                            strictly limited to using its informal good offices to help bring about
                            the inauguration of discussions and facilitate their continuance.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, as I had frequently expressed to the Ambassador and also to Dr.
                            Santos, this Government, because many thousands of American citizens
                            have invested their savings in the obligations of foreign governmental
                            entities, does have an interest in the settlement of the defaults of
                            such obligations which have occurred in the last few years. For this
                            reason, this Government has urged and has done what it could to
                            facilitate discussions between foreign governmental entities and the
                            bondholders to reach an agreement for the resumption of debt service on
                            the bonds held by American citizens.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I stated that no instructions had been sent to you to make any
                            official representations in the matter on behalf of your Government nor
                            to seek an official interview with any member of the Colombian
                            Government. I said that of course we had kept you fully informed of the
                            situation with regard to the debt negotiations so far as the Department
                            was advised thereof, and that you had been authorized in your discretion
                            to express at your dinner to the Minister on July 8 your hope that he
                            personally would study the Council’s observations. I expressed the
                            belief that if you had requested an official interview with the Minister
                            in his office, such an appointment had been sought by you in accordance
                            with your general instructions to do what you considered possible to
                            solve any difficulties that might arise between the two countries and to
                            remove any obstacles to the close and friendly relations <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0502"/>which both Governments desire, and that
                            you undoubtedly had not intended to indicate that any official
                            intervention in this question was being undertaken by the Government of
                            the United States. I said that I felt sure that the Ambassador
                            appreciated that any settlement which might be reached in the debt
                            negotiations and which proved satisfactory to both sides would bring
                            about an atmosphere favorable to the economic and financial cooperation
                            in which both our Governments were interested.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for the statement that I had
                            made as to the position of this Government, and gave me to understand
                            that my explanation would clear up any misunderstanding which his
                            Government may entertain. However, the fact that the Colombian
                            Government thought it important enough to request the Ambassador to see
                            me indicates the sensitiveness of the Government to any suggestion on
                            our part as to proper terms of settlement, and makes essential the
                            exercise of the greatest discretion in conversations with Colombian
                            officials. For the time being, I feel it would be preferable for you not
                            to initiate any discussions of the debt question unless requested by the
                            Department, and, if the matter is raised by responsible officials to
                            confine your remarks to an expression of the Department’s interest in a
                            settlement to the extent set forth above.</p>

                        <p>52. Department’s 68, July 20, 2 p.m. Personal for the Under Secretary. I
                            am astonished by the Colombian Ambassador’s statement to you which is
                            totally at variance with the interview I had with the Minister of
                            Finance on July 17 and which is fully described in my despatch 222 of
                            July 18 which should reach you by direct air mail July 21. In fact, I
                            believe it impossible for the Minister to have gathered any such
                            impression as given you by the Ambassador who can only assume must have
                            entirely misunderstood the message from his Government and has
                            elaborated to you on his misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>I requested the interview believing it expedient before Government policy
                            here became too set to bring before the Minister the comments of
                            Department’s No. 59 of July 11, 6 p.m.,<note n="26" xml:id="d501fn26">Not printed.</note> and coincidentally to get latest information he
                            had on the debt. While the visit was official in the sense that I went
                            to the Ministry it had been agreed that we would informally and
                            frequently meet in this matter to discuss latest news of negotiations
                            from the United States.</p>

                        <p>On this occasion as repeatedly on all previous ones I stated that neither
                            my Government nor I could or would intervene other than by good offices
                            in the debt negotiation.</p>
                        <p>I never have expressed any opinion personal or otherwise on Colombian
                            offer except as I did so respecting so-called Lopez terms as reported
                            page 7 of my despatch No. 117, May 15<note n="27" xml:id="d501fn27">Section entitled “My Opinion of Terms”, p. 472.</note> and at
                            Minister’s request as per section 5 of my despatch 206, July 13. The
                            subject of levying new taxes has never even been discussed in this or in
                            previous conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister began the interview by reading to me cable from Colombian
                            Ambassador describing his June 13 conversation with White. He declared
                            himself so discouraged by White’s “rejection” of Colombian offer as to
                            have been on the point (when requested interview) of cabling Colombian
                            Ambassador to terminate all negotiations with the Protective Council.
                            Because of this attitude I made strongest statement I have made so far
                            which was “that according to him an impasse had been reached which
                            gravely concerned [me] as being highly unfortunate both for Colombia’s
                            good name and credit and for the bondholders, therefore ‘employing his
                            own expression’ I begged him to exercise imagination to resolve the
                            impasse”.</p>
                        <p>The interview ended by Minister promising to summon me and inform me
                            after he had consulted during this week with the Debt Commission.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise the only basis I can imagine for Ambassador’s misunderstanding
                            is that as reported in my No. 47, July 11, 5 p.m., I made to the
                            Minister the identical statement of second paragraph of Department’s No.
                            56 of July 1, 3 p.m.</p>

                        <p>When I called Mr. White today to speak with him about the Brazilian debt
                                situation,<note n="28" xml:id="d502fn28">See <ref target="#pg_357">pp. 357</ref> ff.</note> I inquired whether he had yet
                            presented to his Executive Committee the proposal for a settlement of
                            the Colombian debt default which he had mentioned to me several days
                            ago. Mr. White stated that he had not had this opportunity since most of
                            the members of his Executive Committee were out of town. He informed me,
                            however, that this would not be an obstacle to his discussing his
                            proposal with the Colombian Ambassador the next time the Ambassador
                            called upon him.</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0504"/>
                        <p>I informed Mr. John Laylin later in the day that I thought that if the
                            Ambassador were to call on Mr. White the latter might have something to
                            say to him on the debt question. Mr. Laylin indicated that the
                            Ambassador would be in New York tomorrow and would probably take the
                            occasion to call on Mr. White.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White told me that his proposal would provide for an expenditure of
                            about $650,000 more than the amount of $2,064,000 provided for the
                            payment in the fifth year under the Colombian offer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Laylin told me in the strictest confidence that the Ambassador has
                            agreed to submit to Bogotá a proposal which would be a considerable
                            improvement over the original Colombian offer. The original offer
                            contemplated the following payments:</p>

                            telephoned me from New York to say that the Colombian Ambassador had
                            dropped in to see him yesterday afternoon. Mr. White has prepared a
                            memorandum of the conversation<note n="29" xml:id="d503fn29">Not
                                printed.</note> and is sending a copy of this to the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>In brief, the Ambassador informed Mr. Welles [<hi rend="italic">White?</hi>] that his Government had turned down the suggestion of
                            a temporary offer, preferring to arrive at a permanent offer at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Ambassador’s inquiry as to whether Mr. White had
                            anything to suggest, Mr. White told him that as a result of his study of
                            the extensive documentary material left with him at the first meeting
                            with the Ambassador, he had framed a proposal. Under the proposal of the
                            Colombian Government the total service in the fifth year would be
                            $2,064,000 or 49% of the contractual service. Although the Council could
                            not recommend acceptance of this suggestion to the bondholders, Mr.
                            White thought that the Executive Committee would be prepared to
                            recommend a proposal for service of $2,715,000 or $651,000 more than
                            Colombia would pay in the fifth year under its plan. Mr. White pointed
                            out that the contractual service comes to $4,200,000 a year, whereas
                            under his proposal Colombia would only have to pay $2,715,000 a year, or
                            a saving to the Colombian Government of approximately $1,500,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White reminded the Ambassador that his Government had maintained that
                            owing to the drop in the value of the peso it now took more pesos to
                            acquire the dollar exchange necessary to make service. Mr. White stated
                            that the depreciation in the peso had been 42% and that under his
                            proposal the contractual service would come to 36%, so that the
                            bondholders would be bearing six-sevenths of the hardship to Colombia as
                            a result of the depreciation in the peso.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador further argued that the proposal was not practicable from
                            a political point of view. Later in the conversation he agreed to submit
                            it for the consideration of his Government. Mr. White expressed the hope
                            that it would be possible to instruct Mr. Braden to support this
                            proposal before the Colombian Government. I told him that to do so would
                            not be in keeping with our policy, and that there were special reasons
                            why it would not in any case be possible to do it at this time. Mr.
                            White argued that it would be preferable for this Government to make
                            known its position, since that might dispose the Colombian Government to
                            give his suggestion greater consideration. He was so insistent in his
                            point of view that I finally told him I would place his views before Mr.
                            Welles, but that I was absolutely confident that this Government would
                            not wish to instruct the Ambassador as he had suggested at this
                            time.</p>

                        <p>Mr. John Laylin telephoned to inform me that the debt negotiations had
                            reached a very critical stage. The Ambassador transmitted to <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0506"/>his Government the suggested settlement
                            proposed by Mr. Francis White. The Ambassador has now received a
                            telegram from his Government stating that Mr. White’s proposition had
                            been laid before the President. The telegram continued that the
                            President first of all regretted greatly that the Colombian proposal had
                            been turned down by the Council because he would have to inform the
                            Congress, and secondly, that he considered unreasonable Mr. White’s
                            proposition, and therefore had instructed the Ambassador to inform the
                            Council that the Colombian Government would carry on no further
                            negotiations with it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador today wired his Government, advising against his taking
                            this action, and, in order to open the way for further negotiations,
                            inquiring whether further negotiations with the Council could be held
                            providing they were not on the basis of Mr. White’s proposal.</p>
                        <p>If the reply of his Government is favorable, the Ambassador will then
                            request permission to present to the Minister of Finance a new project
                            of settlement of the debt problem. Mr. Laylin explained that the
                            Ambassador had transmitted to his Government as the formula of Mr.
                            Laylin and Mr. Simpson, of Schroeders,<note n="30" xml:id="d504fn30">J.

                                adviser to the Colombian Government in negotiations connected with a

                            conversation with Mr. Laylin dated July 21 [<hi rend="italic">20?</hi>]

                            concoct something new.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told Mr. Laylin that he would support the Laylin-Simpson
                            project provided that the Department could ascertain in advance from the
                            Council that this project would have the Council’s acceptance. I again
                            informed Mr. Laylin that the Department did not feel that it could
                            undertake to present to the Council the Laylin-Simpson formula, much
                            less to negotiate with the Council to secure its acceptance of that
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Laylin said that he would post me should there be any further
                            developments.</p>

                        <p>Mr. White stated that he had just completed a two and one-half hour
                            conversation with the Colombian Ambassador and Mr. Laylin. The
                            Ambassador informed Mr. White that he had now received a cablegram from
                            his Government to the effect that the Government would not consider the
                            proposal advanced by the Council; that it <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0507"/>did not wish to bargain; that it had hoped the Council
                            would take a helpful attitude; and that it was still very desirous of
                            reaching a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White inquired whether this meant that the Colombian Government stood
                            firm on its original offer. The Ambassador stated that it did not; that
                            the Colombian Government was ready to go further toward meeting the
                            desires of the Council.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the Minister of Finance proposed to put in the
                            budget which will go forward on Monday a request for $1,624,000 for
                            external debt service. This is the amount of service proposed for the
                            first year by the Colombian Government in its project. The Ambassador
                            said, however, that there would be no breakdown of this amount in the
                            budget as between interest and amortization.</p>
                        <p>Upon being informed by the Ambassador that he had no further suggestions
                            to make at this time, Mr. White stated that since the Colombian
                            Government had stated that it did not propose to bargain that he would
                            place all of his cards on the table. He said that the Executive
                            Committee when it met at its last session had agreed to recommend to the
                            bondholders a permanent settlement based upon a 4½% interest rate. He
                            therefore suggested the following formula: for the first year, an
                            interest rate of 3½%, no amortization, which would work out at the sum
                            of $1,624,000 which the Minister of Finance proposed to place in the
                            budget. This interest rate would be increased until it finally arrived
                            at 4½% which would require $2,036,000 which was $28,000 less than the
                            $2,064,000 which the Colombian Government proposed for the five years
                            under its project. 1% amortization would add to what Colombia had
                            proposed to pay in the fifth year by $424,000.</p>
                        <p>I asked Mr. White what the reaction of the Ambassador was to this
                            proposal which did not provide for any amortization in the first year
                            and possibly none for several years. Mr. White said that the Ambassador
                            had made no comment.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador and Mr. Laylin left together, Mr. Laylin stated that
                            they would wait to hear from Mr. White on Tuesday after he had presented
                            his proposal to the Executive Committee. Mr. White stated that he
                            informed Mr. Laylin rather sharply that there was no need for the
                            Ambassador to withhold presenting the idea to his Government since the
                            Executive Committee had already decided to recommend to the bondholders
                            a proposal for permanent settlement based upon the 4½% interest rate.
                            This would be 75% of the contractual service and in line with
                            settlements made with Poland, the City of Warsaw, the Province of
                            Cilicia, Uruguay and China. Of course the Council will present to the
                            bondholders whatever proposal Colombia may make but would not recommend
                            the proposition first advanced by <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0508"/>the Government nor any proposition that did not provide
                            for an ultimate interest rate of 4½%.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White concluded by stating that he felt the Council was going a long
                            ways to meet the Colombian Government and that if the Department could
                            do anything to secure a favorable attitude by the Colombian Government
                            to the Council’s last proposal, the time had come.</p>

                                    the matter, that the Colombian inquiry relates to two distinct

                                    of the Colombian request and of the general nature of the
                                    cooperative program. As regards the possibility of dollar
                                    availabilities against gold, the Treasury would be in a position
                                    to render effective assistance along these lines through
                                    Stabilization Fund operations and would be prepared to render

                                    between the United States and Colombia appeared

                                message<note n="36" xml:id="d507fn36">This message, dated September
                                1, reiterated Colombia’s resolution to proceed in close agreement
                                with the Governments of America in the matter of solidarity;
                                Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, September 9,
                                1939, p. 235.</note> to President Roosevelt and other American Chief
                            Executives.</p>
                        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>He then stated that while Colombia’s economic and fiscal position was
                            excellent, outbreak of hostilities in Europe necessarily would have some
                            adverse effect, therefore Government would economize and reduce public
                            works and all other expenditures which were not absolutely essential.
                            Both Bank of the Republic and private banks are in strong position to
                            carry through unless public became hysterical and for example presented
                            government mortgage bank cedulas for payment. The Minister was satisfied
                            even such contingencies will be avoided if a credit of say $50,000,000
                            were available from us since its mere existence would so fortify public
                            confidence as to make it unnecessary to draw thereon. He suggested
                            possible restriction limiting withdrawals to $5,000,000 in first 6
                            months and $10,000,000 in first year. By such an arrangement the
                            Minister considered government fiscal position would be protected and it
                            would not be forced at any time to default on payments such as salaries
                            to army or public employees; the country’s financial and banking
                            structure would be supported and in case certain products such as drugs
                            or chemicals were unobtainable from abroad small national industries
                            insuring supply thereof could be initiated. As the Department is aware I
                            consider this latter idea largely uneconomic and hope they may later be
                            dissuaded therefrom.</p>
                        <p>I described to the Minister my conversation (as reported to the
                                Department<note n="37" xml:id="d507fn37">Despatch No. 22, March 3,
                                not printed.</note>) on this subject with the President and Minister
                            of Finance and which I initiated last February on instructions from
                            President Roosevelt who I said had in mind possibility of just such a
                            crisis as the present. I said I had left with President Santos August 17
                            and Minister of Finance August 21 memorandum quoting letter from
                            Secretary of the Treasury (in accordance with Department’s telegram
                            #77). It therefore now devolved upon Colombian Government to define its
                            request in order for the question to be further investigated. This I
                            suggested could be done through the Ambassador in Washington although of
                            course I would always be happy to lend them every assistance. The
                            Minister considered the matter so pressing that he would prefer to
                            proceed through both Embassies. I observed there was one factor, which,
                            perhaps, would not arise; but in all fairness I felt obliged to mention,
                            viz, because of the default on Colombian securities widely distributed
                            among 40,000 to 50,000 bondholders in the United States, my Government
                            faced a measure of political embarrassment in giving financial
                            assistance of the kind contemplated, nevertheless I sincerely hoped the
                            two problems would not be linked. The Minister said he understood my
                            viewpoint, deeply appreciated the steps we had already taken and
                            indicated that the matter will be promptly pursued with us.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>I deemed it expedient thus to mention foreign debt since with support of
                            Federal Reserve credit and/or through Stabilization Fund operations
                            Colombian Government might be enabled to overcome political opposition
                            here to settlement and be willing to begin payments on higher interest
                            rate than June offer<note n="38" xml:id="d507fn38">See telegram No. 56,

                            might now accept such terms. In any event it can do no harm for
                            Colombian Government again to be informed of political considerations
                            which confront us in this particular.</p>

                        <p>I informed the Ambassador<note n="39" xml:id="d508fn39">i. e., the
                                Colombian Ambassador.</note> that Mr. Welles had requested me to
                            take up a matter with him which Mr. Welles had intended doing himself,
                            but his departure for the Panama conference<note n="40" xml:id="d508fn40">See <ref target="#pg_15">pp. 15</ref> ff.</note>
                            made it impossible for him to do so, since the matter was one which
                            could not be discussed hurriedly.</p>
                        <p>I then told the Ambassador of the very great importance attached by this
                            Government to a settlement of the debt default with Colombia. The long
                            delay in arriving at a settlement was retarding closer relationships,
                            both governmental and private. In view of the very cordial relationships
                            that existed between the two Governments, it seemed a pity that any
                            obstacle to the fullest possible cooperation should be permitted to
                            continue. For this reason the Department had high hopes that the
                            discussions between the Ambassador and the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council would result in a settlement. The impasse which
                            apparently had been reached in the negotiations was most disheartening,
                            particularly because at the present juncture of world affairs
                            cooperation between Colombia and the United States seemed all the more
                            important.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Ambassador that the Department in its desire to be helpful
                            was prepared to play a more active role than usual in negotiations
                            between foreign governments and American bondholders. I then recalled
                            that several weeks ago Mr. Laylin had come in for an informal
                            conversation in which he had intimated that if it were possible to
                            ascertain in advance the Council’s favorable view towards a settlement
                            with a 3% starting interest rate and a final rate of 4%, the Ambassador
                            would probably be prepared to submit it to his Government with a strong
                            recommendation that it be accepted. At the time <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0511"/>that Mr. Laylin had made this approach,
                            the Department had hoped that through discussion the two parties would
                            themselves find a common meeting ground. In view of the unlikelihood of
                            this now occurring, the Department had given renewed thought to the
                            situation and now wished to lay the following suggestion before the
                            Ambassador for his consideration.</p>
                        <p>In order to conciliate the two points of view a solution might be arrived
                            at on the terms of a starting interest rate of 3% and a final rate of
                            4¼%. In addition, there would be certain amounts for disposing of the
                            arrears and for amortization. A settlement on this basis seemed fair and
                            equitable to both parties. In order to secure its acceptance the
                            Department was prepared to support it before the Council with all the
                            influence at its command upon the knowledge that it was accepted by the
                            Colombian Government. I said that the Department naturally could not
                            give any assurances that the Council would accept the proposal, but that
                            I could say that the United States Government would lose no opportunity
                            to persuade each and every member of the Executive Committee of the
                            Council of its belief that the offer was fair and reasonable and
                            equitable, all things considered. I added that if this suggested
                            procedure met favorably with the Ambassador, I would be interested in
                            having his ideas with regard to the best manner of submitting it to the
                            Colombian Government for its consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then made a rather lengthy statement covering the history
                            of the negotiations. By implication he admitted that the offer made by
                            the Colombian Government might have been more generous, but discoursed
                            upon the political realities in Colombia. The Conservatives are against
                            any settlement that would be considered equitable in this country and
                            the Liberals in Congress are desirous of a settlement at as low rates as
                            possible because of the bearing of the settlement of the default of the
                            national debt upon future settlements of the departmental and municipal
                            debts. He said that it was his firm belief that every year that went
                            past without a settlement, made a settlement favorable to the
                            bondholders just that much more difficult. For that reason a modest
                            arrangement with a low interest rate in the early years was better than
                            no arrangement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the particular proposal advanced, he said that, while he
                            was prepared to recommend strongly a 3–4% settlement several weeks ago,
                            provided there were adequate indications that the offer would be
                            acceptable to the Council, the outbreak of war introduced so many
                            unpredictable factors that he was not at all sure that his Government
                            would not consider such an offer today an “impertinence”. In any case,
                            he stated emphatically that in his opinion 4% was as high as Colombia
                            should go in view of present money rates, and that under <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0512"/>no circumstances would he submit to his
                            Government the proposal of an ultimate interest rate of 4¼%.</p>
                        <p>In the ensuing discussion the Ambassador said he thought that it should
                            be made very clear that his Government to date had not budged one iota
                            from its estimate as to the total amount of service on the external debt
                            that Colombia should make available. Within the total amount, he knew
                            that the Government was prepared to negotiate regarding distribution as
                            to interest, amortization, and the arrears.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that it would be too bad to see the present
                            opportunity for a settlement pass without further efforts to come to a
                            solution. While the war might result in a falling off of Colombian
                            exports for a few months, a protracted war might mean the opening up of
                            markets to an even greater extent for other products. It was possible
                            that Colombia might find difficulty in disposing of all of its coffee,
                            but it might find new markets for its petroleum, the supply of which
                            would be greatly augmented in the very near future when oil started
                            flowing through the pipeline from the Barco concession to the coast. I
                            inquired whether the Ambassador would have any objection to my drawing
                            up possible schedules of debt payment, which we might then talk over.
                            The Ambassador replied he would be glad to have me do so, provided that
                            the final interest rate was 4%.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that schedules should be drawn up and that another
                            conversation would be held in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>As he left, the Ambassador suggested that it might be useful for Mr.
                            Welles to have a full talk with Señor Jaramillo, a member of the
                            Colombian Delegation to the Panama meeting, regarding Colombia’s
                            economic and financial problems. He reminded me that Señor Jaramillo not
                            only was a member of the Debt Commission, but was a person whose views
                            on finance are very highly regarded by members of both political parties
                            in Colombia. He thought that a general discussion inevitably would get
                            around to the debt problem during which Mr. Welles could find an
                            opportunity of emphasizing the importance to Colombia of an early
                            settlement of the debt default.</p>

                        <p>16. The Colombian Foreign Minister and Esteban Jaramillo<note n="41" xml:id="d509fn41">Former Minister of Finance, member of the
                                Colombian delegation at Panama.</note> have put before us with
                            evident seriousness their anxieties lest the present European war
                            disturb their whole exchange situation and peril their present reserves
                            and force them to restrict imports needed <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0513"/>for various national developments. The fear centered
                            particularly around the prospect of reduced coffee sales and depressed
                            coffee prices. They have asked us whether in connection with our general
                                declaration<note n="42" xml:id="d509fn42">See address of the Under

                                (Washington, 1940), pp. 33–39.</note> we will be prepared to grant
                            them financial assistance. An explanation has been given to them of the
                            various types of operations which might be considered by our Government
                            and they have now presented a memorandum requesting financial assistance
                            in the form of a credit from the Banco de la Republica for reserve
                            purposes and to enable it to continue necessary imports and to maintain
                            the stability of Colombian money for economic purposes and for the
                            acquisition of naval vessels. (Regarding this matter of financing it
                            will immediately be explained to the Colombian Government that it cannot
                            be considered). The Government suggests that the amounts to be
                            determined after careful study of the most urgent needs and the
                            conditions which should be established for the service of the existing
                            debt and of the form and terms of the money to be loaned.</p>
                        <p>It stated that it would be disposed to organize a new banking institution
                            to receive loaned monies and control its expenditure with such technical
                            help as the United States may believe necessary. It suggests that as a
                            first step the Government of Colombia would be willing to invite us to
                            send a representative to Bogotá to study the whole question. Copies of
                            the memorandum submitted will be sent you at once by air mail. The scope
                            of the proposals are obvious and it is to be foreseen we believe that
                            any actual arrangement would have to be based on an exchange of letters
                            and commitments similar to that negotiated with Aranha. It would help us
                            greatly if we could say either that we would accept the invitation of
                            the Colombian Government to send a representative to Bogotá or to say
                            that we had been authorized by you to extend an invitation to the
                            Government of Colombia to send a special representative to Washington.

                            and the Treasury and cable us as promptly as possible. It has already
                            been explained to the Colombian Government that any undertakings taken
                            by any branch of the American Government must be at the present time
                            conditional upon the possession of necessary funds.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Foreign Minister has presented a memorandum<note n="45" xml:id="d509fn45">Post, <ref target="#pg_779">p. 779</ref>.</note>
                            in the same sense though less extensive. This memorandum emphasizes the
                            loss of markets for cotton, sugar, and other products <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0514"/>and the necessity of financial
                            assistance to avoid further depreciation of the sol and further
                            curtailment of imports from the United States. It asks Export-Import
                            Bank credit to the Reserve Bank of Peru for the payment of American
                            exports to Peru. It offers to deposit equivalent sums in sols to be
                            liquidated on bases to be determined.</p>
                        <p>In our judgment the problems facing Peru will be genuinely serious
                            perhaps as serious as those faced by any of the American Republics. We
                            would like authorization also to inform the Peruvian Foreign Minister
                            that he is invited to send a representative to Washington to discuss the
                            situation with the Export-Import Bank.</p>

                            cable I just sent the Department (No. [16]) regarding the requests made
                            by the Governments of Colombia and Peru for financial assistance.</p>
                        <p>These were presented to me before my general address<note n="46" xml:id="d510fn46">September 25, 1939, <hi rend="italic">Report of

                                33–39.</note> to the Conference, which included a statement of what
                            type of financial assistance the American Government was prepared to
                            consider, in which address I included the statement agreed upon in the
                            conversation that took place before I left Washington with the Secretary
                            of the Treasury and Mr. Jesse Jones. I feel that we would be distinctly
                            well advised to respond as promptly and as effectively as we can to both
                            requests by showing a willingness to enter into immediate discussion as
                            to the possible financial assistance. Since in both instances careful
                            study will no doubt be required and rather extensive discussions and
                            negotiations will have to be undertaken to determine what assistance may
                            be practicable and available, I requested in my cable authorization to
                            extend invitations to both Governments to send representatives to
                            Washington—or in the case of the Colombian request, alternatively the
                            acceptance by us of their suggestions that we send a special
                            representative to Bogota. I hope to receive a reply in sufficient time
                            to enable me to discuss the matter further with the Colombian and
                            Peruvian Delegations while still in Panama.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing for the information of the Department the copy of a

                            this conversation, Mr. Jaramillo submitted the prepared memorandum which
                            is the basis for my cable. I am enclosing the original of this

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: I had a systematic and
                                straightforward conversation with Mr. Jaramillo.</p>
                            <p>He stated, in substance, that the Colombia Reserve and Exchange
                                situation had been satisfactory up to the recent present, but that
                                now his Government entertained fears lest the loss of markets and
                                possibly fall in prices, especially coffee prices would bring them
                                embarrassment by diminishing their gold and exchange reserve, by
                                compelling them to restrict imports in a way which would force the
                                Government to curtail its work of economic development and public
                                improvement.</p>
                            <p>He, therefore, wanted to know whether it might be possible with the
                                American Government to make them a loan, as he put it, for the
                                protection of their reserves.</p>
                            <p>I explained that there were three possible ways in which the matter
                                might be presented:— <list>

                                        collateral, the Treasury or the Federal Reserve could make
                                        the loan.</item>

                                    <item>If it was desired to make payments of imports from the
                                        United States, some arrangement might be worked out with the
                                        Import-Export Bank.</item>
                                </list>
                     </p>
                            <p>We discussed each of the three methods of procedure in some detail.
                                He said that after having had the chance to think it over and to
                                discuss it with his colleagues, he would give me a memorandum more
                                clearly indicative of their desires.</p>
                            <p>I explained that if a loan through the Export-Import Bank was
                                desired, it would probably prove advisable for the Colombian
                                Government to send a representative to Washington to discuss the
                                matter with the Bank and Mr. Jones—after we had cleared the way for
                                the discussions. I explained further the present financial position
                                of the <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0516"/>Bank, stating that
                                all transactions now being entered into by the Bank were being
                                entered into subject to an understanding that they would only become
                                valid when and as the Bank might have the necessary funds.</p>
                            <p>We then had a general conversation about the nature and effects of
                                foreign borrowing and lending, especially when Governments directly
                                entered into the transaction. He said he was aware that while the
                                moment the money was obtained everything was cheerful but when the
                                payment date came along the mood changed; he compared it with the
                                mien of a person entering and leaving a gambling casino. I said that
                                it was the reflection on this subject even more than the matter of a
                                financial risk that preoccupied official authorities in the United
                                States and made us cautious in the undertaking of loan
                                transactions.</p>
                            <p>I made direct reference to the still existing default of the
                                Colombian Government Dollar Debt. He said that the Colombian
                                Government was on the point of doing something effective, when the
                                war crisis arose, but now it felt that it had to postpone a
                                decision. He seemed to think, however, that there was a chance that
                                in connection with any loan arrangement worked out something might
                                be done on the present debt. This was left vague.</p>
                            <p>We agreed that after he had presented his memorandum, discussion
                                would be resumed.</p>

                        <p>31. Your 16, September 26, 3 p.m. The Department has again discussed with
                            the Treasury and Messrs. Jones and Pierson the broad problem of economic
                            and financial cooperation with the other American republics, with
                            special reference to your suggestion that you be authorized to extend
                            invitations to the Governments of Colombia and Peru to send special
                            representatives to Washington to discuss their situations with this
                            Government. Our conversations indicate general agreement on a number of
                            phases of the problem:</p>
                           <p>1. That it will be possible to proceed with Export-Import Bank
                                        and Stabilization Fund operations within the limitations
                                        discussed by you with the Treasury and Mr. Jones. Prior to
                                        your departure Mr. Jones indicated that additional
                                        Export-Import Bank operations might be undertaken to the
                                        extent of 15 to 20 or even possibly 30 million dollars,
                                        while the Secretary of the Treasury indicated that he was
                                        prepared to use the Stabilization Fund in operations secured
                                        by gold deposited <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0517"/>in this country. Since that time the Export-Import Bank
                                        has agreed to commitments with Brazil, Chile, and Panama
                                        amounting to 11 million dollars. Within these limitations,
                                        however, it will be possible to go ahead with certain of the
                                        most urgent requests for assistance.</p>
                                    <p>With specific regard to Colombia, it is the Department’s
                                        impression that the amounts of assistance in the form of a
                                        line of credit for the Banco de la Republica would probably
                                        be considerably greater than present availabilities would
                                        make possible. The Treasury has already indicated to the
                                        Colombian Government that it is prepared to make available
                                        dollars against gold collateral (Colombia has $20,000,000 of
                                        gold). Beyond this it might be possible to consider
                                        favorably modest Export-Import Bank transactions. It is not
                                        immediately obvious how much the assistance requested by
                                        Peru might involve, but it would seem possible that
                                        assistance to tide over the emergency might be effected
                                        within the limits of Export-Import Bank powers mentioned
                                        above.</p>
                           <p>2. That as soon as you return it will be essential and
                                        desirable for this Department, the Treasury and the Federal
                                        Loan Agency to collaborate in the preparation of a broad
                                        program for economic and financial cooperation with the
                                        other American republics to be presented to the Congress for
                                        its approval. Such a program would probably involve
                                        increased lending powers for the Export-Import Bank,
                                        specific congressional authorization for the type of
                                        Stabilization Fund Transactions, other than against gold
                                        which we have discussed, and possibly authorization to make
                                        long term loans of gold in connection with reorganizations
                                        of their monetary systems. It is generally hoped and
                                        believed that with the full presentation of all aspects of
                                        the situation widespread approval of such a program would be
                                        forthcoming.</p>
                                    <p>The Treasury also suggests that the Under Secretary of the
                                        Treasury should fully discuss the situation and such a
                                        program with you as well as other officials of the three
                                        agencies prior to his going to the Guatemalan conference in
                                        November.</p>
                                <p>3. That it would be unwise from the immediate internal political
                                    point of view, as well as in relation to the broad program
                                    mentioned in (2) above, to have during the near future visits
                                    here of special representatives with inevitable attendant
                                    publicity. For this reason it is not believed desirable at the
                                    present time to invite the Governments of Colombia and Peru to
                                    send special representatives or missions to Washington to carry
                                    on economic discussions with us.</p>
                                <p>4. That due consideration be given to debt default situations and
                                    other problems outstanding between this country and individual
                                    other American republics. The emergency situation arising out of
                                    the war <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0518"/>naturally calls
                                    for reexamination of the previous attitude assumed by this
                                    Department and other Government agencies. The Department
                                    believes that where a country is in a position to conclude a
                                    reasonable and equitable debt settlement, or at least to enter
                                    into a reasonable transitional arrangement, this Government
                                    would not be justified in extending credits unless this
                                    operation was preceded by or accompanied by a satisfactory debt
                                    arrangement. (The Treasury feels strongly that the negotiations
                                    for such an arrangement should not be linked closely to the
                                    credit discussions, nor the credits possibly considered as an
                                    inducement for the debt arrangement.) In those cases where a
                                    country is utterly unable to make any payment that would be
                                    considered by the bondholders as reasonable even transitionally,
                                    the Department would be prepared to recommend to other agencies
                                    the extension of credit facilities to tide over the emergency
                                    and possibly pave the way for a future settlement of the debt
                                    situation.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Colombian Delegation has indicated that the
                            Colombian Government would be prepared to make some sort of service of
                            the existing debt. For your information the Colombian Ambassador on
                            September 26 inquired under instructions whether it was correct that the
                            Export-Import Bank had opened a credit of five million dollars to Chile
                            and had participated in the financing of the sale of ships to Brazil.
                            The Colombian Government desired to know whether it was still on the
                            “blacklist” because of inability to come to an agreement with the
                            Council. The correctness of his Government’s information with regard to
                            the Chilean and Brazilian transactions was confirmed. The Ambassador
                            then asked whether this Government would be prepared to receive
                            proposals regarding Export-Import Bank assistance. The Ambassador was
                            informed that the Department was now in the process of reexamining its
                            policy, and that while no definite statements could be made the
                            possibility of Export-Import Bank credits for Colombia was no longer out
                            of the question.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Peru, you will recall that last June the Peruvian
                            Government was informed that this Government would be happy to welcome a
                            mission to discuss further economic cooperation between the two
                                countries.<note n="50" xml:id="d511fn50">See telegram No. 39, June
                                13, 1 p.m., to the Chargé in Peru, <ref target="#pg_776">p.
                                    776</ref>.</note> At the time it was suggested that full
                            preliminary exploration of the possibilities for cooperation be carried
                            out and that Peru submit as soon as possible the projects which it
                            believed desirable and feasible. Since that time the Peruvian Government
                            has given no evidence of any desire to go forward with this matter.</p>
                        <p>Among the matters taken up at that time with the Peruvian Government was
                            the debt situation, and the Embassy repeated the statement made by the
                            Under Secretary to the Peruvian Ambassador that “in view of our
                            knowledge of the very favorable economic and financial <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0519"/>situation of the Peruvian Government,
                            in which we all rejoice, it was very difficult to understand why no real
                            effort had been made by the Government to reach an agreement for the
                            adjustment of the legitimate obligations to the bondholders”.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you discuss the situation quite frankly with the
                            Colombian and Peruvian Delegations, pointing out why it would be
                            undesirable at this time to arouse any widespread publicity such as
                            would follow upon an invitation for special representatives to come to
                            Washington. You may indicate that within the limitations of present
                            powers, this Government would be pleased to consider immediate
                            assistance to tide over emergency situations, and that such assistance
                            might be followed by broader cooperative arrangements early next year if
                            wider powers are authorized by the Congress. It is suggested that you
                            indicate that this Government will be pleased to take up the immediate
                            matters with regular diplomatic representatives in Washington, and that
                            we should welcome all possible information regarding the existing
                            situation in each country and plans for requests for the future. Mr.
                            Jones has indicated that if it will assist you in your discussions at
                            Panama, he is prepared to send representatives of this Government to
                            Colombia and to Peru, and you are authorized to state that this
                            Government will do so if you feel that such a course is desirable.
                            Although it is not felt that such visits by American representatives are
                            really necessary, and there is some danger that such visits might lead
                            to expectations which might later not be realizable, such a course might
                            enable this Government to postpone final decisions until broader powers
                            to act in the situation have been obtained.</p>

                        <p>34. Department’s 31. Thank you for the careful consideration given to the
                            Colombian and Peruvian requests for financial assistance. I am
                            completely in accord with your general analysis. We have explained the
                            situation fully to the Colombian Foreign Minister and to Dr. Esteban
                            Jaramillo in main substance telling them that except for possible
                            advance against gold the only immediate assistance that could be given
                            pending additional authorization by Congress would be modest
                            Export-Import Bank financing. We have told them we were authorized to
                            convey the willingness of the Government immediately to enter into
                            discussion of the purpose, terms, form et cetera of such an advance and
                            would be willing to undertake these discussions either with their
                            representative in Washington or through a special representative <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0520"/>that we might send to Bogota.
                            The delegation said that they would consult their Government as to
                            whether to proceed in Washington or in Bogota and inform us.</p>
                        <p>We raised the question of the present default in Colombian dollar bonds
                            following in our exposition the general policy summarized in our 31.
                            Feis explained that we could not give definitive [<hi rend="italic">definite?</hi>] expression to position that would be taken in the
                            matter but he said that his best personal guess was that the government
                            would be willing to work out a modest emergency financing through the
                            Export-Import Bank without asking as a condition the execution of a debt
                            settlement but that it would probably ask for a definite reaffirmation
                            by the Colombian Government of its intention of seeking and executing a
                            reasonable settlement. He said further, again making clear that it was
                            merely his best personal judgment, that when and as subsequent to grant
                            of new authorization by Congress the discussions enlarge themselves,
                            this Government would feel that a settlement of the private debt
                            question was most important. He based these opinions on the feeling of
                            the bondholders and the sentiment in Congress.</p>

                        <p>46. From Duggan. It is my impression from a further conversation with the
                            Colombian Ambassador today that he can be persuaded to submit for the
                            consideration of his Government the Laylin formula for a debt settlement
                            provided he can inform his Government that the Department will support
                            it vigorously before the Council. In view of the probable initiation of
                            discussions with the Colombian Government for short term financial
                            assistance, it would seem desirable to advance the debt discussions as
                            rapidly as possible. Is it agreeable to you to inform the Ambassador
                            that if his Government submits the Laylin formula to the Council the
                            Department will do everything it appropriately can to secure its
                            acceptance. [Duggan.]</p>

                        <p>45. I would recommend that you inform the Colombian Ambassador that if
                            his Government submits to the Council a debt settlement proposal <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0521"/>in the general range which I
                            understand Laylin has been proposing the Department will do everything
                            it appropriately can to secure its acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Our understanding is that this formula would contemplate the resumption
                            of payment on a 3% scale which would gradually rise to 4%. It might be
                            well to reserve flexibility as to the secondary details.</p>

                        <p>The Colombian Ambassador called at my request. I told him that after full
                            consideration in the Department and consultation with Mr. Welles, I was
                            in a position to inform him that if his Government presents to the
                            Council the Laylin formula for a debt settlement the Department will do
                            everything that it appropriately can to secure its acceptance by the
                            Council. I took pains to make it clear to the Ambassador that this was a
                            most unusual step for the Department to take but that it was willing to
                            do so in order to contribute to a solution of the debt problem.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for the extent to which the
                            Department was prepared to go to assist in this matter. He reminded me
                            that it was last midsummer that he had expressed his willingness to
                            support before his Government the Laylin formula and that since that
                            time there had been momentous changes in the world. He inquired whether
                            the Department would prefer that he convey to the Colombian Government
                            at once the Department’s disposition to be helpful in the form proposed
                            without his endorsement of the Laylin formula, or await the outcome of
                            his studies to appraise the effect of the war upon Colombian economy for
                            the purpose of determining whether Colombia should now proceed on the
                            basis of the Laylin formula. In explanation, the Ambassador stated that
                            he had requested certain data from Colombia which were expected shortly.
                            He hoped, therefore, to have come to a decision before long as to the
                            desirability of making the Laylin offer at this time.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Minister that the Department’s willingness to support the
                            Laylin formula before the Council had grown out of the suggestion that
                            the Ambassador present the formula to his Government and support it
                            before his Government, informing it meanwhile that the Department was
                            willing to use its good offices with the Council. I said that that still
                            seemed to me to be the way to proceed, and that I very much hoped that
                            his studies would convince him that Colombia <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0522"/>can go ahead and propose the Laylin formula, I pointed
                            out that it would not involve an outlay of funds any greater than that
                            proposed by the Minister of Finance in his proposition.</p>
                        <p>It was left that the Ambassador would let me know, and he hoped within a
                            few days, of the outcome of his reappraisal of the situation.</p>

                        <p>102. Please inform Colombian Government that pursuant to the
                            conversations which the American Delegation had with the Colombian
                            Delegation at Panama, we have discussed with the other interested
                            branches of this Government the Colombian proposals for possible
                            financial assistance. On the basis of these discussions we are prepared
                            to examine this whole matter with sympathetic disposition and care with
                            a view to determining what assistance may be feasible and advisable, and
                            what form and by what methods. It is our view that this process of
                            examination would be more satisfactory if the Colombian Government would
                            send a representative to Washington to enter into discussions with us
                            here. This representative should have as complete a knowledge as
                            possible of the Colombian Government’s desires and ideas and be
                            authorized to discuss them fully. Please see that it is understood
                            completely that these discussions would be entered into with absolutely
                            no commitment; and for this reason it is our opinion that the least
                            possible publicity is desirable.</p>
                        <p>From Welles to the Ambassador: In view of Jaramillo’s familiarity with
                            the discussions up to the present, and his general experience and
                            qualities, his selection by the Colombian Government would help to bring
                            about satisfactory arrangement. Furthermore if he were selected, it
                            might well be that the Colombian Government would also appoint him as
                            its member at the November 15 meeting of the new Financial and Economic
                            Advisory Committee<note n="51" xml:id="d516fn51">For correspondence
                                concerning the establishment of the Committee, see <ref target="#pg_45">pp. 45</ref> ff.</note> at which occasion I am
                            sure his presence would be very valuable.</p>
                        <p>If the Colombian Government is willing to send a representative here, it
                            is suggested that the first week in November would be the most
                            convenient time for him to arrive giving us time to do the necessary
                            preparatory work to clarify our own judgments.</p>

                            October 9 and 12 I recommended Jaramillo’s appointment to the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs who was unable to induce his acceptance. Therefore, I
                            transmitted your timely message to President Santos on October 21 and as
                            a result Jaramillo now agrees to go to Washington. I will telegraph as

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Dr.
                            Esteban Jaramillo has been appointed Colombian representative on the
                            Financial and Economic Advisory Committee scheduled to convene in
                            Washington on the fifteenth instant. Also, he has been appointed
                            Economic adviser to the Colombian Embassy in Washington. A biographical
                            sketch of Dr. Jaramillo was given in my Despatch No. 309.<note n="52" xml:id="d518fn52">September 18, not printed.</note> Dr. Jaramillo
                            should reach New York by the Grace liner <hi rend="italic">Santa
                                Lucia</hi> on or about November 13, and I request that appropriate
                            facilities and courtesies be given him on his arrival.</p>
                        <p>Enclosed is a résumé of conversation I had with Dr. Jaramillo yesterday.
                            It will be observed therefrom that, with the approval of President
                            Santos, promptly after his arrival in Washington, he will endeavor to
                            reach a settlement of Colombia’s foreign debt in the United States on
                            the basis that interest payments shall be resumed at 3 per cent and
                            thereafter increased by stages to 4 per cent. He will then wish to
                            obtain financing from the Export-Import Bank or other sources in the
                            amount of $10,500,000. Subsequently additional financial assistance will
                            be required up to $25,000,000.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized to Dr. Jaramillo the benefits Colombia might possibly gain
                            by reason of a rapid debt settlement. Likewise I expressed my optimism
                            that, if a debt settlement is promptly concluded, he will find not only
                            United States Government authorities but, perhaps, private bankers
                            anxious, if possible, to assist Colombia financially.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0524"/>
                        <p>It is generally felt here that so great is Dr. Jaramillo’s prestige in
                            economic and financial matters any agreement he makes will be approved
                            in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Jaramillo also is apparently ready, as soon as the public debt has
                            been accommodated, to arrange a refunding of the National City-First of
                            Boston group loan. In this connection, it occurs to me that Mr. Frank
                            Smith, National City Bank’s General Supervisor for Colombia, by reason
                            of his knowledge of Colombian conditions, might be useful as a
                            consultant, from time to time, during these conversations. If the
                            Department desired his presence, I am sure his principals would arrange
                            for him to go to Washington.</p>
                        <p>Since the announcement of Dr. Jaramillo’s appointment, there have been
                            several commendatory editorials and other comment in the local press,
                            most of which accept as a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> a
                            forthcoming debt settlement and the extension of further loans to
                            Colombia.</p>
                        <p>An interview in Washington with former Ambassador Lopez and his brother,
                            the ex-president, was prominently displayed in all the Bogota
                            newspapers. These articles feature the Ambassador’s censure of the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council and express the hope that
                            organization will be eliminated from future negotiations, which instead
                            will be advanced by United States Government authorities (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). A typical article from <hi rend="italic">La
                                Razón</hi> of October 21 [<hi rend="italic">31</hi>], 1939, is
                                enclosed.<note n="53" xml:id="d518fn53">Not reprinted.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>Mr. Smith of the National City Bank confidentially informed Mr. Wright of
                            this Embassy that Dr. Jaramillo was annoyed by the stories of the
                            Schroeder Banking Corporation speculating in Colombian bonds. Dr.
                            Jaramillo is reported to have added that neither Schroeder nor anyone
                            else could intervene, for their own profit, in the forthcoming
                            negotiations. Mr. Smith believed, therefore, that the aforementioned
                            firm would be dropped as financial advisers to the Colombian
                            Embassy.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday, Dr. Jaramillo informed me he expected to reach Washington
                                on November 14. He will immediately inform Ambassador Turbay on
                                recent discussions within the Colombian Government, relating to the
                                settlement of its foreign debt and other financial or economic
                                matters. He is confident his attendance at the Financial and <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0525"/>Economic Advisory Committee
                                meetings will not hinder his initiating active discussions, looking
                                to the settlement of the Colombian debt in the United States and in
                                obtaining financial assistance from such units of our Government as
                                the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Jaramillo said he had talked at length with President Santos and
                                other members of the administration and was glad to inform me
                                Colombia would not stand on the offer made last May to the Council
                                for Foreign Bondholders, Inc. but, pursuant to informal discussions
                                between Ambassador López Pumarejo and the State Department, will
                                make a proposal to holders of Colombian bonds to resume service on a
                                3% basis, thereafter, increasing the interest rate by stages up to
                                4%. Although there will be suggested some minor changes from the
                                plan discussed in the State Department, Dr. Jaramillo had not yet
                                been informed by the Minister of Finance what these changes would be
                                but, in any case, they will not amount to more than $3,000,000 over
                                the whole period of the liquidation of the loan. I remarked that I
                                understood the Washington conversations had contemplated a maximum
                                of 4½%, but he felt the limit should be 4%.</p>
                            <p>In his opinion there will be a long war in Europe, coffee prices may
                                decline and Colombia, therefore, will have to face many economic
                                problems. Its immediate necessity is to reestablish confidence
                                amongst its own and foreign capitalists, in fact there had already
                                been some tendency by Colombian moneyed interests to withdraw from
                                all activities but they would again come into the market as soon as
                                the financial stability of the Government and the banks is
                                assured.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Jaramillo will seek an immediate loan, or at least a commitment,
                                of $10,500,000, of which approximately $4,500,000 will be used to
                                re-equip the State railways with rolling stock and other materials
                                from the United States. One of the principal requirements is the
                                financing of the Agricultural Mortgage Bank (see my Despatch No. 117
                                of May 15, 1939). Other items are the purchase of two dredges for
                                the Magdalena river at a cost of about $500,000. each and
                                approximately $1,500,000. for revenue cutters, in accordance with
                                paragraph <hi rend="italic">e</hi>. of my October 23 Confidential
                                Memorandum to Under Secretary.<note n="54" xml:id="d518fn54">Not
                                    found in Department files.</note>
                     </p>
                            <p>Subsequent needs of his Government will amount to an additional
                                $25,000,000., a large portion of which will be dedicated to
                                essential road construction and public works.</p>
                            <p>I told Dr. Jaramillo I was hopeful the Export-Import Bank, if
                                Congress increased its loaning power, would assist in financing
                                purchases in the United States but the funds required for the
                                Agricultural Mortgage Bank presented a more difficult problem. He
                                replied that in Panama Dr. Feis had indicated that, since an
                                adequate financing <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0526"/>of this
                                Institution would enhance Colombian purchasing power, thus
                                indirectly aiding the buying of agricultural machinery and
                                implements from the United States, something might be done in
                                connection therewith. Dr. Jaramillo asked for my advice. I said,
                                speaking without full knowledge of present conditions in Washington,
                                I, nevertheless, hoped something could be done, as for instance, it
                                occurred to me if a gold stabilization loan were made to the Bank of
                                the Republic that Institution’s resources would be so reinforced as,
                                perhaps, to enable it to make the loan to the Agricultural Mortgage
                                Bank. Another possibility, I said, was that Colombian credit would
                                so improve with a settlement of the foreign debt that financing
                                might be obtained from private sources.</p>
                            <p>I indicated to Dr. Jaramillo that, as soon as a debt settlement had
                                been reached, it might be well also to refund the National
                                City–First of Boston Group loan. Representatives of the National
                                City Bank had implied to me that an interest rate, such as was
                                contemplated on the public debt would be satisfactory to them,
                                although they would require a rapid amortization in say eight to ten
                                years but they added, if a refunding agreement were consummated, the
                                Group would be disposed to re-lend to Colombia considerably greater
                                amounts than were involved in this transaction. Moreover, the
                                National City Bank, according to its General Supervisor for
                                Colombia, Mr. Frank Smith, would then be ready to extend commercial
                                credits in volume within Colombia.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Jaramillo, without reservation, accepted my recommendation that
                                the most important thing of all was speedily to reach a debt
                                settlement, thereby, laying the credit foundation which would
                                greatly facilitate the obtaining of financial aid from both United
                                States Government and private sources.</p>
                            <p>I told Dr. Jaramillo I would send letters introducing to him a few
                                leading New York bankers whom I thought, after conversations with
                                him, might become interested in financing and investments in this
                                country. Copies of these letters addressed to Mr. George W. Davison,
                                Chairman ‘of the Board of the Central Hanover Bank and Trust
                                Company; Mr. Henry C. Von Elm, Vice Chairman of the Board of the
                                Manufacturers Trust Company; Mr. E. Roland Harriman of Brown
                                Brothers Harriman &amp; Company; and Mr. Herman G. Brock, Vice
                                President of the Guaranty Trust Company, are attached hereto.<note n="55" xml:id="d518fn55">None printed.</note>
                     </p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I assured Dr. Jaramillo he could count on sympathetic
                                understanding and a wholehearted will to cooperate from the Under
                                Secretary and others in the Department.</p>

                        <p>The Costa Rican Minister,<note n="2" xml:id="d519fn2">Ricardo Castro
                                Beeche.</note> after a rather lengthy introduction, finally got
                            around to reference to the bill introduced by Congressman Izac
                            authorizing the President to purchase the Cocos Islands. After some
                            sparring around, during which I stated that I was sure the Costa Rican
                            Government understood that the bill was not an administration measure,
                            the Minister launched into a discourse about the change in world
                            conditions. He made particular reference to the aggressive designs of
                            Germany, Italy and Japan and to the good neighbor policy of the United
                            States which had, he thought, eliminated from every thinking person in
                            the other American republics, the belief that the United States any
                            longer entertains imperialistic designs against the other American
                            republics. The Minister thought that changed times required a
                            reappraisal of former policies and attitudes. He ventured the question
                            whether the status of the Cocos Islands, which certainly today have a
                            new strategic importance because of aviation, should not be
                            reviewed.</p>
                        <p>Without indicating any interest, I asked the Minister what he had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>The Minister replied that sentiment in Costa Rica with regard to the
                            Islands undoubtedly had undergone a very considerable change. At present
                            the Government maintained no jurisdiction of any kind over the Islands
                            and the public long ago had come to the realization that the Islands had
                            little value because of their economic resources; while he was not sure,
                            he thought that the Costa Rican people today would approve of the
                            disposal of the Islands to the United States. He intimated that he had
                            discussed this possibility with the President upon his last visit to
                            Costa Rica and that the President had not discouraged this thought. In
                            later conversation the Minister threw out the idea that possibly for the
                            sale or long-term lease of the Islands the proceeds might be dedicated
                            to the construction of the Inter-American <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0529"/>Highway.<note n="3" xml:id="d519fn3">See <ref target="frus1937v05#pg_175">

                                    175</ref> ff.</note> At the conclusion of the conversation, the
                            Minister stated that he had recently written to the President sending
                            him a copy of the bill. He indicated that he expected a reply from the
                            President. I said that if there was anything of mutual interest in the
                            reply, I would be very glad to hear from the Minister.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation in which the Minister did
                            practically all of the talking, I took occasion to state that the
                            traditional policy of this Government had been that it was not
                            interested in acquiring the Islands but that it did feel constrained to
                            interest itself should the possibility ever arise of the Islands passing
                            to a third country. The Minister maintained stoutly that Costa Rica
                            never would alienate the Islands to any country except the United
                            States.</p>

                            <p>On Tuesday evening, February 21st, at 7 o’clock, I called upon the
                                Secretary of the Treasury in order to discuss with him informally
                                several subjects—among them the present status of the legislation
                                for the settlement of the balance of the Public Works Debt.</p>
                            <p>The conversation having begun with the discussion of the proposed
                                revaluation measure and its effect upon Cuba’s credit, I deemed it
                                not only opportune to discuss this further matter, which so directly
                                concerned Cuba’s credit, but also to inquire directly as to the
                                present status of the measure. Dr. Garcia Montes said that he had
                                gained the distinct impression from Mr. Warren Pierson, President of
                                the Export-Import Bank, during his visit to Habana, that he (Mr.
                                Pierson) was not only concerned about the revaluation proposal and
                                very dubious, to say the least, as to the effect which it might have
                                upon Cuba’s credit, but also of the opinion that unless or until the
                                balance of the Public Works Debt had been settled, no credits would
                                be extended for additional public works in Cuba. I replied to the
                                Secretary that, although I had not expected our conversation
                                necessarily to take that trend, I was glad to improve the
                                opportunity thus afforded <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0531"/>to observe that he had correctly appraised Mr. Pierson’s
                                opinion—adding that, as the Secretary knew well, I had been
                                constrained to observe to the appropriate authorities of his
                                Government, including the President<note n="3" xml:id="d522fn3">Federico Laredo Bru.</note> and Colonel Batista,<note n="4" xml:id="d522fn4">Fulgencia Batista, Chief of Staff of the Cuban
                                    Army.</note> that the Export-Import Bank, being a governmental
                                institution, could not extend credits of this nature until the
                                aforementioned recognized obligations of the Cuban Government had
                                been liquidated.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury is a very cautious man who, while very
                                well informed and of sound opinions, finds it difficult, if not
                                impossible, successfully to combat the political exigencies and
                                considerations which his superiors bring to bear upon him: he is
                                especially cautious when replying to direct inquiries. He said that,
                                as I was doubtless aware, the financial situation of Cuba was
                                growing worse: I replied that I was unfortunately aware of it. He
                                said, for that reason, the opposition consistently contended that
                                the Government should not incur further obligations at this time
                                when they faced a budgetary deficit and when the price of sugar
                                showed no sign of improvement: I replied that I had been informed of
                                this unfortunate situation and this resultant attitude by both the
                                President and Colonel Batista. He said that as the remainder of the
                                $85,000,000 issue<note n="5" xml:id="d522fn5">See Foreign

                                    ff.</note> was not sufficient to meet these obligations, a
                                supplemental issue was necessary: I replied that I was, of course,
                                fully aware of this fact. He then said that the Government was
                                compelled not only to seek further revenue in order to offset the
                                inevitable debt settlement, but was also obliged to consider the
                                levying of further taxes in order to afford proper security for this
                                supplemental issue: I inquired whether he had in mind a renewal of
                                the proposal for the taxation of petroleum derivatives. He replied
                                that he had.</p>
                            <p>As the conversation then became devoted to that phase of the
                                question, I said that I felt obliged to bring several considerations
                                to his attention: that Warren Brothers<note n="6" xml:id="d522fn6">To Warren Brothers Company of Boston was due a large part of
                                    the Cuban public works debt for the construction of 481 miles of
                                    the Central Highway running from Piñar del Rio to Santiago de
                                    Cuba between 1927 and 1931.</note> had specifically waived their
                                insistence upon this form of security; that the oil companies and
                                interests, not only foreign, but Cuban, had several months ago
                                informed me of their intention to resist the imposition of further
                                taxation upon their products and that if such was undertaken there
                                might be expected a renewal of this resistance; further, that any
                                imposition of taxes of this nature at this time would run counter to
                                the provisions of the Reciprocal Trade Agreement<note n="7" xml:id="d522fn7">Signed August 24, 1934, Department of State

                                without previous negotiations between the respective Governments—a
                                matter which I had several times brought to the attention of the
                                Cuban Department of State during the last year. I stated further
                                that I did not wish to occupy a position in favor of legislation
                                which would benefit one group of American interests to the detriment
                                of another, but that I should be remiss if I did not again call his
                                attention to these facts.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary said that he was aware of this situation and that he
                                was at present devoting all efforts to devising some means whereby
                                revenue might be obtained from these sources without the renewed
                                opposition of the oil interests. I inquired whether he had in mind
                                the taxation of certain derivatives and not others: he replied that
                                such was in his mind: I inquired whether he had kerosene, for
                                example, in mind: he replied that he had and that he was further
                                examining the possibilities of taxation (or other charges) upon
                                products from the selling of which the companies were making large
                                profits: reverting to the general question, I inquired whether he
                                expected early passage of the bill: he replied that he believed that
                                such would be possible, but again emphasized the phase of the matter
                                to which he had previously referred. The conversation terminated at
                                that point.</p>
                            <p>On the same day I was informed upon fairly good authority that
                                Senator Albanés, who belongs to the Opposition, had stated that he
                                was so convinced that liquidation of the Public Works obligations
                                was essential to the restoration of Cuba’s credit and the extension
                                of credits from the Export-Import Bank that he had informed the
                                leaders of the Government party that he was prepared to vote for the
                                passage of the bill.</p>
                            <p>Senator Verdeja, President of the Senate, also informed me recently
                                that he believed that it was essential to Cuba’s credit that the
                                bill be passed.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that I had several weeks ago received what
                                appeared to be credible assurances from responsible parties that the
                                question of taxation upon petroleum derivatives would not again
                                arise, and as I had informally mentioned to one of the American oil
                                interests here that such assurances had been conveyed to me, I
                                deemed it proper to inform the same American oil interests—equally
                                informally and unofficially—that I had received information that the
                                question might be renewed. I have reason to believe that the
                                American interests will not only take renewed steps to meet the
                                situation if it recur, but they are willing to discuss with other
                                oil interests, and with the Cuban authorities, methods by which the
                                desired ends may be obtained without resorting to open friction
                                which characterized the last incident of this nature.</p>

                        <p>The status of the Purdy and Henderson claim<note n="8" xml:id="d523fn8">This portion of the debt was for construction of capitol building
                                at Habana.</note> has once more become precarious. Ambassador Wright
                            telephoned yesterday to say that he had that day received a call from
                            Senators Saladrigas, Casanova and German Lopez, who had reported that
                            “because of political opposition” it now seemed doubtful whether the
                            enactment of the debt settlement bill by the Senate, with Purdy and
                            Henderson included therein, could be obtained. Mr. Wright also reported
                            that these Senators had sent Dr. Mañas<note n="9" xml:id="d523fn9">Presumably Arturo Mañas, member of the Cuban Institute.</note> to
                            him on the preceding day with a report to the same effect and a request
                            that Dr. Mañas arrange for Ambassador Wright to receive the Senators.
                            The Senators said that they had approached the Ambassador at the
                            suggestion of Colonel Batista.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wright told me that he had once more covered all the ground recently
                            discussed with the Secretary of the Treasury and with Senator Casanova,
                            emphasizing again that the omission of Purdy and Henderson would not be
                            regarded by this Government as a “settlement” of the Public Works Debt;
                            that without liquidation of the Public Works Debt Cuba could not expect
                            to get the desired cooperation of this Government in any future public
                            works financing; and that it seemed doubtful whether this Government
                            would even find it possible to conclude the contemplated revision of the
                            trade agreement.<note n="10" xml:id="d523fn10">Notation on margin: “Mr.

                            he had not acted on this authorization since the situation then existing
                            had been met, but that he would now probably seek interviews both with

                            <p>The recent memoranda, transmitted by despatches, have explained the
                                kaleidoscopic changes which have taken place in the matter of the
                                settlement of the Public Works Debt. The most recent development
                                appears to be encouraging:</p>
                            <p>When I called upon the President of the Republic yesterday in order
                                to deliver to him the expression of President Roosevelt’s
                                appreciation of his prompt and satisfactory reply with regard to the
                                messages sent by President Roosevelt to Chancellor Hitler and
                                Premier Mussolini,<note n="13" xml:id="d524fn13">April 14, <ref target="frus1939v01#pg_130">vol. I, pp. 130</ref>–<ref target="frus1939v01#pg_133">133</ref>. For reply of
                                    President Laredo Bru, on April 15, see Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press Releases</hi>, April 22, 1939, p.
                                    326.</note> I had it in mind to inquire of the President when I
                                might discuss with him the matter of the claims of Warren Brothers
                                Incorporated and Purdy and Henderson Company—for it will be recalled
                                from my despatch No. 1871 of April 14, 1939,<note n="14" xml:id="d524fn14">Not printed.</note> that I had communicated
                                the relevant portions of Mr. Welles’ letter to me, of March
                                    25th,<note n="15" xml:id="d524fn15">Not found in Department
                                    files.</note> to Colonel Batista, but not to the President.</p>
                            <p>The President, however, most unexpectedly, broached this subject
                                himself by saying: “I think the matter of the ‘obligaciones’ is now
                                satisfactorily adjusted and I am glad to tell you so. Of course,
                                every one knows that there has been a slight cloud in connection
                                with the claim of Purdy and Henderson Company but, in view of
                                existing circumstances, it seems much wiser to pass that over.”</p>
                            <p>As I felt that I could not allow this repeated aspersion upon Purdy
                                and Henderson Company to pass entirely unnoticed, I replied that
                                neither my Government nor I was prepared to admit that there had
                                been any irregularity in connection with this claim and I emphasized
                                the fact that it had been examined and passed upon by two
                                Commissions and no less than three Secretaries of the Treasury: I
                                added that I had received assurances from the present Secretary of
                                the Treasury that the examination which he and Señor Montoulieu<note n="16" xml:id="d524fn16">Edouardo I. Montoulieu, official of the
                                    Cuban Treasury Department.</note> had conducted <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0535"/>had satisfied the Secretary as to
                                the justice of the claim and that he saw no reason for again
                                bringing up the contentious question of the percentage of
                                remuneration, which had already been accepted on behalf of the
                                Government. The President made no reply to this observation which I
                                wished to place on record with him as well as with Colonel
                                Batista.</p>
                            <p>In order to make the record especially clear, I improved the
                                opportunity to explain to him that while I had discussed the matter
                                with Colonel Batista and with the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant
                                to instructions, I had not assumed the initiative in discussing it
                                with members of the legislative body—and had only done so when such
                                legislators broached the subject to me: the President stated that he
                                was aware of my attitude, and he was good enough to say that he
                                appreciated it and commended it. I then said that I was in receipt
                                of a letter from Mr. Welles which authorized me to speak in his name
                                both to the President and to Colonel Batista with regard to this
                                matter (I refer to Mr. Welles’ letter dated March 25th) and that I
                                had conveyed this message orally to Colonel Batista some days ago—at
                                which time he had informed me that he would communicate it to the
                                President: the President replied that Colonel Batista had done so. I
                                then said that I trusted that he (the President) would immediately
                                recognize the fact that I had deferred my representations to him
                                pending the result of my conversation with Batista although, as I
                                had said, I had intended to request of him that day the opportunity
                                for the communication of that message: the President replied that he
                                was so aware.</p>
                            <p>I then said to him that our position could be concisely stated as
                                follows: we were still ready and willing to extend to Cuba the
                                advantages which had been recited and discussed in the formulation
                                of the so-called Ten Points agreed upon during Colonel Batista’s
                                visit to Washington;<note n="17" xml:id="d524fn17">Colonel Batista
                                    attended the Armistice Day ceremonies in November 1938 and at
                                    that time discussed U. S. relations with Cuba at the Department
                                    of State. No memoranda of these conversations have been found in
                                    Department files.</note> that the continued procrastination in
                                the matter of this Public Works indebtedness had assumed such forms
                                that I had been reluctantly constrained to inform all appropriate
                                officials of the Cuban Government who had discussed the matter with
                                me, that no credits could be expected unless or until these
                                recognized obligations had been met; and that the present apparent
                                reluctance of Congress to do so was jeopardizing the Supplemental
                                Trade Agreement—to say nothing of the other matters enumerated in
                                the aforementioned Ten Points. I added that when the legislators had
                                spoken to me I had observed that if the delay and non-fulfillment
                                were due to a recalcitrant opposition, it seemed to me that the
                                responsibility should be placed squarely upon <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0536"/>the shoulders of such opposition
                                and that the public should be aware of the fact that those parties
                                were the ones who were to blame: I added, however, that this was all
                                predicated upon the assumption that the Government of Cuba desired
                                to receive these advantages and that, while my Government was still
                                desirous of according them upon a reciprocal basis, it was for the
                                Government of Cuba to determine whether it desired to receive them
                                or not.</p>
                            <p>I closed by saying that these observations might perhaps appear
                                inopportune in view of what he had just told me, but that I wished
                                to place on record with him, as I had done with Colonel Batista, the
                                attitude of our Government in the simplest terms. The President
                                expressed acquiescence and added to his previous assurances the fact
                                that he had spoken to, and was continuing that day to speak with,
                                various members of Congress.</p>

                            out of consideration the Purdy and Henderson group was passed on to Mr.

                            afternoon. Mr. Welles stated that he would tell Senator Casanova that

                            Henderson would be considered an incomplete one and would not enable

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador came to see me this morning at his request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador first told me that Senator Casanova had now returned to
                            Habana and had told him on the telephone that there <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0537"/>was no question whatever that the
                            Government could obtain a satisfactory majority in both Houses for the
                            passage of the legislation which will provide for the resumption of
                            payment on the Warren Brothers obligations. Senator Casanova had said,
                            however, that in view of the registration period now going on under the
                            electoral law, it would be impossible to obtain a quorum until July 5
                            since the great majority of the senators and deputies were in their own
                            provinces rounding up political adherents for their respective parties.
                            Senator Casanova had told the Ambassador that he had talked with
                            President Laredo and that they had both agreed that an effort would be
                            made on July 5 to introduce this legislation and obtain its immediate
                            passage, and that probably they would attempt to obtain passage at the
                            same time of legislation authorizing issuance of new silver
                            certificates. In the meantime, the Ambassador said, the Cuban Secretary
                            of the Treasury had requested Mr. Brownson who was apparently acting as
                            local representative of Warren Brothers to exchange communications in
                            which Mr. Brownson as the duly authorized representative of Warren
                            Brothers would express complete satisfaction with the new form in which
                            Warren Brothers’ obligations would be recognized by the Cuban
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>You will indicate to the Cuban Government that this Government considers
                            as prerequisite to any resumption of converations leading to increased
                            economic cooperation between the two countries the settlement of the
                            admitted claims of Warren Brothers and Company and Purdy and Henderson
                            Company, and of the so-called Morris claim.<note n="21" xml:id="d528fn21">The claim of Fred A. Morris was based on a
                                decision of the Cuban Supreme Court providing compensation for land

                  </p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States considers, further, that the
                            circumstances surrounding the discussions of November 1938, at which
                            time this Government expressed its willingness to enter upon a program
                            of economic cooperation with Cuba, have been materially altered by the
                            credit moratorium situation and the recent enactment of monetary
                                legislation<note n="22" xml:id="d528fn22">Law approved July 8, 1939,

                            referred to in the attached note. This Government believes that the
                            enactment of a satisfactory measure to liquidate the Cuban credit
                            moratorium and the amendment of the recently enacted monetary law to
                            eliminate certain undesirable features and ambiguities are essential to
                            the reestablishment of normal commercial and financial relations between
                            the two countries, and it is prepared, at the request of the Cuban
                            Government, to furnish competent technical experts to advise the
                            appropriate authorities of the Cuban Government in the determination of
                            the provisions of such legislation.</p>
                        <p>In view of the close relationship of the fiscal situation to an economic
                            atmosphere in Cuba favorable to the carrying out of a program of
                            economic cooperation, the Government of the United States considers that
                            the enactment of suitable tax legislation embodying the recommendations
                            of the Magill report, which was prepared at the request and expense of
                            the Cuban Government, would be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>You will further indicate that this Government is prepared, if the Cuban
                            Government takes action settling the claims of Warren Brothers and
                            Company and Purdy and Henderson Company, and the so-called Morris claim,

                                beneficial through the negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement
                                which has been of self-evident advantage to each of the

                                greatly improve the likelihood of an adequate and reasonable price
                                for world sugars.</p>
                            <p>In November 1938 discussion was inaugurated of a program of economic
                                cooperation of the type which has subsequently been considered and
                                thereupon rendered effective as between the United States and other
                                American Republics. At the same time my Government indicated its
                                interest in supplementing the existing Cuban-American trade
                                agreement on mutually advantageous terms, as well as in taking other
                                steps demonstrative of the importance which it attaches to close and
                                harmonious relations with Your Excellency’s Government.</p>
                            <p>My Government stated that as a prerequisite to the favorable
                                consideration by the Export-Import Bank of the extension of credits
                                for any construction of public works in Cuba, there must necessarily
                                be involved the equitable adjustment of the obligations recognized
                                by the Cuban Government as legitimately due to certain nationals of
                                the United States: first, the final liquidation of the claims of
                                Messrs. Warren Brothers and Company and Purdy and Henderson Company,
                                which comprise the balance of the so-called Public Works Debt; and,
                                second, the payment of the so-called Morris claim which is based
                                upon a judgment in favor of the claimants rendered in 1929 and
                                upheld by the Supreme Court of Cuba in 1931.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the supplementary trade agreement, negotiation of
                                which has been pending since November 30, 1938, Your Excellency has
                                indicated that Your Government now desires to discuss a certain item
                                not included in the original announcement by my Government of its
                                intention to negotiate. You will recall that a full explanation of
                                the procedure which my Government observes in such negotiations was
                                made to appropriate officials of Your Excellency’s Government at the
                                time of that announcement, it having then been made clear that it
                                would not be possible for my Government to give consideration to a
                                concession on an item of the United States Tariff, unless that item
                                was included in the original announcement. The inclusion of any
                                additional item at the present time would therefore require a
                                special announcement followed by public hearings, which my
                                Government does not consider now practicable. It may be observed
                                that my Government has as yet received no reply to the specific
                                proposals which were handed to the Cuban Ambassador in Washington on
                                May 24.<note n="29" xml:id="d528fn29">

                            <p>In further pursuance of its desire to improve the relations between
                                Cuba and the United States, my Government has proposed for the
                                consideration of the Cuban Government a draft treaty of
                                Establishment and Navigation designed to solve some of the mutually
                                vexatious questions which arise from time to time regarding the
                                residence of nationals of one country in the territory of the other
                                as well as those relating to shipping and navigation. No specific
                                reply of an official nature has been received from Your Excellency’s
                                Government in regard to this matter but Your Excellency has
                                indicated informally that it might be held in abeyance pending the
                                meeting of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
                            <p>This Government has viewed with the greatest sympathy the desire of
                                the Cuban Government to enact legislation which will, in a manner
                                fair both to creditor and to debtor, lessen the burden of the
                                excessive and unduly onerous exactions which a certain category of
                                debtors in practice cannot meet. My Government, however, has on
                                frequent occasions called to the attention of the Cuban Government
                                the fact that very considerable investments of American capital have
                                been made in Cuba, and its hope that in justice to the American
                                investors the credit moratorium situation in Cuba will be solved
                                upon a basis, which while responsive to the just needs of the
                                debtors, would nevertheless provide an orderly procedure for
                                adequate and equitable repayment to the creditors. While my
                                Government understands that a full hearing was recently granted to
                                interested parties before the legislative commission appointed to
                                consider this matter, nevertheless the bill passed last week by the
                                Cuban Senate would not appear to have accomplished this objective,
                                nor to have contributed to the creation of that feeling of economic
                                and financial confidence in Cuba which could be regarded as
                                conducive to the carrying out of those measures of cooperation which
                                my Government has expressed its willingness to undertake.</p>
                            <p>The situation has further been aggravated by monetary legislation
                                recently enacted, the terms of which have given rise to highly
                                undesirable ambiguities of interpretation and resultant dislocation
                                of commerce between the United States and Cuba. Your Excellency will
                                recall in this regard that the bearing of this legislation on the
                                trade agreement between our two countries was the subject of
                                repeated representations and inquiries by me on July 6, 7, and 8
                                and, furthermore, that I had the honor to make similar inquiries of
                                the President of the Republic on the eighth instant. At that time I
                                was assured by the President, as well as by Your Excellency, that no
                                violation of the existing trade agreement between Cuba and the
                                United States was intended and, further, that the regulations to be
                                prepared for the enforcement of this measure would carry ample
                                assurances in that regard. These regulations, however, have not as
                                yet appeared, and <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0542"/>while my
                                Government is confident that they will embody the aforesaid
                                assurances, it is the belief of my Government that the necessary
                                clarification might advantageously be incorporated in the law itself
                                in order that any difficulties of interpretation may subsequently be
                                avoided.</p>
                            <p>In view of all these circumstances, my Government regretfully finds
                                itself obliged to inform Your Excellency that all studies with
                                respect to the aforesaid program of economic cooperation and looking
                                toward the improvement of commercial relations between the two
                                countries have been suspended on the part of the United States,
                                pending a clarification of the situation and of the specific matters
                                which are alluded to in this note. Furthermore, it is the intention
                                of my Government, because of the highly undesirable state of
                                uncertainty among those engaged in trade between Cuba and the United
                                States as a result of the facts set forth above, to make public
                                announcement on August 1, 1939 to the effect that the negotiations
                                looking toward a supplementary trade agreement with Cuba have been
                                indefinitely suspended.</p>

                                20, which was delivered to me personally by Your Excellency

                            <p>The diverse and important matters examined in that note give it an
                                especial interest which the Government of Cuba quickly appreciated,
                                    <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0543"/>and it is its desire,
                                in giving Your Excellency an immediate reply, to help to clarify
                                those parts of the note which might indicate confusion or disparity
                                in the points of view of both Governments due, perhaps, to

                           <p>I. The Government of Cuba hastens to declare that the close
                                        and cordial cooperation indicated by Your Excellency as the
                                        desire of your Government has found and continues to find
                                        sincere reciprocity on the part of the Government of Cuba,
                                        which has not forgotten the days when the Cuban and American
                                        peoples together fought fraternally for the same ideal of
                                        liberty and justice. My Government recognizes and is
                                        thankful for the friendly cooperation which, at different
                                        times in the history of the Cuban people, has been
                                        generously given to it by the United States. And it is
                                        reason for satisfaction and pride to be able to declare that
                                        Cuba, on its part, has reciprocated under the influence of
                                        identical high sentiments, collaborating within its powers
                                        and together with the American people toward the triumph of
                                        high ideals of peace and justice. It would be impossible to
                                        forget at this time the singular cooperation which Cuba
                                        offered to the Government and the people of the United
                                        States during the difficult days of the World War, when it
                                        sacrificed legitimate profits on the altar of a democratic
                                        victory, or the no less constructive and loyal help in the
                                        pacific battles of Congresses and International
                                        Conferences—some of them as recent as those at Buenos
                                            Aires<note n="31" xml:id="d529fn31">See <ref target="frus1936v05#pg_3">

                                        the noble continental aims of Your Excellency’s
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>My Government observes in the first paragraph of the note to
                                        which I am replying the reference which Your Excellency
                                        makes to the new Treaty of Relations of May 29, 1934,
                                        through which the right of intervention of the United States
                                        in Cuban matters contained in the so-called Piatt Amendment
                                        was abrogated, and it is pleased to recognize that the free
                                        and voluntary agreement of the United States to this
                                        Convention constitutes the high and just reparation of what,
                                        from the first moment of its existence, was an undeserved
                                        limitation upon Cuban sovereignty, dictated in 1901 by the
                                        Military Government of Occupation.</p>
                                    <p>My Government considers it convenient also to record that
                                        among the great historic proofs of Cuban-American friendship
                                        should be included the maintenance, by virtue of the free
                                        and sovereign will of the people of Cuba, of a very
                                        important provision of the now abrogated Piatt Amendment. I
                                        refer to the rental to the Government of the United States
                                        of the Naval Station at Guantanamo, the status of which has
                                        not been altered notwithstanding the new Treaty of Relations
                                        of 1934, because Cuba considers that in this manner it
                                        serves the cause of the defense of the United States of
                                        America, offering to <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0544"/>Your Excellency’s people and Government the highest proof
                                        of friendship which it is given to an independent nation to
                                        offer.</p>
                           <p>II. As Your Excellency well points out, a logical projection of
                                        such cordial relations was the initiation in Washington,
                                        during the month of November, 1938, of the confidential
                                        conversations between high officials of our respective
                                        Governments which had as an object the study of a program of
                                        economic cooperation of the nature of those which
                                        subsequently were studied and placed in effect between the
                                        United States and other American Republics.</p>
                                    <p>The program of economic cooperation examined in Washington
                                        had as a fundamental object the satisfactory solution of the
                                        portion of the suspended Public Works Debt still not
                                        liquidated—that debt having happily been settled in its
                                        greater portion in February 1938—and, immediately, the
                                        advancing of funds by the Export-Import Bank for the
                                        carrying but in Cuba of an extensive plan of public
                                        works.</p>
                                    <p>It should be stated that the payment of the remaining public
                                        works obligations is considered, as was considered the
                                        payment of the bonds and other obligations of identical
                                        origin the service of which has been satisfactorily renewed,
                                        frankly unpopular, to the point that all the administrations
                                        which directed the affairs of the Republic between August,
                                        1933 and December, 1936, on which date the Honorable Señor
                                        Dr. Federico Laredo Brú assumed the Presidency of the
                                        nation, refused to recognize them. Never, it may be roundly
                                        affirmed, did the Cuban Government in its relations with the
                                        United States assume and carry out an obligation of such
                                        onerous transcendency and within such an adverse economic
                                        situation; and that singular effort, the material and moral
                                        value of which has undoubtedly been evaluated by the
                                        Government of the United States, should also be taken into
                                        account, to demonstrate at least the decision of Cuba to
                                        cooperate in the plan examined with Your Excellency’s
                                        Government to promote the improvement of reciprocal
                                        relations.</p>
                                    <p>My Government, notwithstanding reiterated and well-known
                                        efforts on the part of the Executive Power and of
                                        distinguished leaders of the Legislative Power, has
                                        encountered serious difficulties in its effort to arrive at
                                        a satisfactory adjustment of the still pending Public Works
                                        Debt through means of appropriate legislation. The
                                        Government of the Republic is confident, nevertheless, that
                                        those difficulties, inherent in the complete democratic
                                        regime existing in Cuba, will be easily understood by Your
                                        Excellency’s Government, which, because it is governed by a
                                        constitution analogous to that of Cuba, may have found
                                        itself many times confronted with similar obstacles.</p>
                                    <p>The liquidation of the so-called Morris claim, examined
                                        during the conversations in Washington, as Your Excellency
                                        points out, was conditioned in subsequent conversations held
                                        in Habana upon a fiscal <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0545"/>situation which would permit of its payment
                                        without bringing upon the Government charges of unjustified
                                        preference.</p>
                           <p>III. Your Excellency mentions in the course of his note the
                                        negotiations pending since November 30, 1938, partially to
                                        modify and add to Schedules I and II of the Trade Agreement
                                        of 1934, and, although I shall later specifically express
                                        the opinion of my Government in this matter, I hasten to
                                        clear up certain doubts which might be interpreted as a
                                        delay on the part of the Government of Cuba in replying to
                                        the ever welcome requests of Your Excellency’s
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>In effect, when our Embassy in Washington was informed of the
                                        willingness of the Government of the United States to
                                        negotiate an additional trade agreement, the Government of
                                        Cuba held public hearings similar to the procedure followed
                                        by Your Excellency’s Government, hearing the parties
                                        interested in the negotiation, and oil February 16, by means
                                        of a note from the Embassy in Washington,<note n="33" xml:id="d529fn33">Not printed.</note> it definitively
                                        submitted the proposals which contained the desiderata of
                                        the Cuban Government.</p>
                                    <p>On May 24 the United States sent our Ambassador in Washington
                                        its partial counter-proposal,<note n="34" xml:id="d529fn34">See note to the Cuban Ambassador, May 24, <ref target="#pg_558">p. 558</ref>.</note> announcing
                                        that (its views concerning) a very interesting part of the
                                        Cuban proposals, those with reference to the definition of
                                        dumping and other general provisions, would follow the
                                        counter-proposals—which has not yet occurred.</p>
                                    <p>My Government, notwithstanding that situation, which
                                        naturally prevented it from forming an exact opinion,
                                        proceeded to reply to the part of the counter-proposals
                                        already received and, at the same time, made certain
                                        observations which were sent to Washington the 15th of this
                                        month and were formally presented to the Department of State
                                        on the 20th,<note n="35" xml:id="d529fn35">See note from the
                                            Cuban Chargé, <ref target="#pg_563">p. 563</ref>.</note>
                                        according to a cable from our Embassy.</p>
                           <p>IV. Having made this explanation, and notwithstanding having
                                        expressed on a previous occasion, orally to Your Excellency,
                                        the opinion of the Cuban Government concerning the Treaty of
                                        Residence and Navigation, I permit myself expressly to
                                        confirm that opinion now.</p>
                                    <p>I told Your Excellency then that, although the Cuban
                                        Government, in principle, had the greatest interest in
                                        contributing to place the every-day-more-important relations
                                        between our citizens on a proper and firm basis of
                                        reciprocal facilities, it found, among the provisions of
                                        said project, aside from certain ones which appeared not to
                                        be reciprocal in character, certain others which conflicted
                                        fundamentally with existing legislation in Cuba, and which
                                        perhaps might constitute a serious obstacle to the free
                                        development of the constituent activities soon to begin.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, I pointed out another and still graver
                                        difficulty, and that is that, however great might be the
                                        desire of the Government of <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0546"/>Cuba to establish reciprocal privileged
                                        treatment with the Government of the United States, the
                                        concessions which were to be given in social as well as
                                        civil, mercantile, maritime matters, etc., would have to be
                                        extended automatically, because of treaty obligations and by
                                        virtue of the most-favored-nation clause, to countries which
                                        do not have relations of such close friendship with Cuba as
                                        does the United States, rendering practically invalid,
                                        through the obligatory extension of such privileges, all the
                                        laws established by the Cuban nation for the protection of
                                        the worker.</p>
                                    <p>My Government, having these circumstances in mind, wishes to
                                        state its intention of postponing the examination and
                                        discussion of the draft Treaty of Residence and Navigation
                                        proposed by Your Excellency’s Government until after the
                                        work of the already convoked Constituent Assembly has been
                                        completed.</p>
                           <p>V. Your Excellency’s note refers also to a matter which,
                                        although it does not appear opportune to discuss it in
                                        detail because it affects the concept of the sovereignty and
                                        relations of the public powers of the Cuban nation, I
                                        desire, nevertheless, frankly to clarify with the Government
                                        of the United States, whose sympathy for us, which we
                                        appreciate, in the laborious and difficult solution of this
                                        problem, is reiterated: it is that which refers to the
                                        measures adopted by the Cuban Congress to liquidate the
                                        mortgage moratorium. The Senate of the Republic, with the
                                        object of settling a problem of exceptional character which
                                        affects the very social and economic marrow of the country,
                                        has just approved a bill which is awaiting discussion in the
                                        House of Representatives.</p>
                                    <p>Such circumstances prohibit the Executive Power from taking
                                        into consideration any recommendation which involves a
                                        specific injury to the constitutional faculties of the
                                        public powers and to the national sovereignty.</p>
                                    <p>I do not know what the fate of the bill referred to will be,
                                        but it is possible to suppose that in the event the bill
                                        becomes a law of the Republic the investments of citizens of
                                        the Union—which your note mentions—and which may be affected
                                        by the bill referred to, although very small in proportion
                                        to the total amount which the bill aspires to regulate, will
                                        doubtless receive treatment identical with that accorded to
                                        national interests, without its being possible, as Your
                                        Excellency will easily understand, to agree in this matter
                                        to any differentiation or privilege.</p>
                           <p>VI. The grave situation which the Cuban Government confronts
                                        because of the depreciation of the national currency,
                                        referred to by Your Excellency, and which we discussed amply
                                        in our conversations of the 6th, 7th, and 8th, at the time
                                        of the crisis, has improved markedly as a result of the
                                        prudent measures adopted by the Government to overcome a
                                        panic which was due more to artificial causes than to a
                                        normal reaction of the currency.</p>
                                    <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0547"/>
                                    <p>I had occasion to express to Tour Excellency at that time
                                        assurance that the Government of President Laredo Brú would
                                        not take steps which would tend to aggravate the dislocation
                                        of the Cuban currency, or the paralyzation of foreign trade,
                                        and I am confident of having convinced Your Excellency of
                                        the interest of the Government of the United States,
                                        parallel to that of Cuba, in contributing to the
                                        stabilization of the currency, the reduction in value of
                                        which would have eliminated or reduced its acquisitive power
                                        in relation to countries having currencies of full value.
                                        Consequent with the substance of those conversations, the
                                        Cuban Government has had the satisfaction of seeing
                                        confidence promptly restored by the prudent emergency
                                        legislation which it dictated opportunely, and among which
                                        legislation I should point out in particular Decree No.
                                            1727,<note n="36" xml:id="d529fn36">July 19, 1939, <hi rend="italic">Gaceta Oficial</hi>, July 19, p.
                                            1346.</note> which clarifies the proposal of the
                                        Government to restore business without having resorted to
                                        measures which might unnecessarily have interfered with
                                        banking operations connected with our foreign commercial
                                        activities.</p>
                           <p>VII. My Government notes with true regret the announcement
                                        contained in Your Excellency’s note of the decision of your
                                        Government to suspend the studies pertaining to the
                                        aforementioned program of economic cooperation which has as
                                        its object the improvement of the commercial relations
                                        between our two countries, until such time as the situation
                                        and the specific matters mentioned in such note are
                                        clarified. My Government, although it vehemently believes
                                        that the present note clarifies the situation and the
                                        specific matters mentioned above, is obligated, much to its
                                        regret, to declare on its part that it has suspended the
                                        efforts of various kinds directed at converting into
                                        legislation the agreements related to that program of
                                        economic cooperation, and expresses its hope that the doubts
                                        or inexact interpretations which appear to underlie the
                                        decision of the Government of the United States which Your
                                        Excellency has communicated to me may disappear.</p>
                                    <p>My Government desires also, foreseeing serious economic
                                        difficulties which were examined and discussed during the
                                        conversations in Washington in November 1938, when the
                                        program of economic cooperation was agreed to, wishes to
                                        record its fear, that in the face of economic and fiscal
                                        realities which are beyond its untiring efforts, it will be
                                        obliged, to its great regret, in order temporarily to
                                        overcome the possible difficulties, to suspend at a not far
                                        distant date the service of the readjusted obligations which
                                        form a part, as far as this Republic is concerned, of the
                                        program of economic cooperation so many times referred
                                        to.</p>
                        <p>VIII. The denunciatory warning that your Government is pleased to
                                    give the Government of Cuba of the announcement of its intention
                                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0548"/>publicly to declare
                                    on the 1st day of August next that the negotiations to modify in
                                    part the commercial treaty of 1934 will be indefinitely
                                    suspended, has caused the Government of the Republic natural
                                    surprise and regret and obliges it, as much as it deplores it,
                                    in the face of such an unexpected decision, to declare on its
                                    part and as of today’s date, July 23, that said negotiations
                                    have been indefinitely suspended.</p>

                        <p>96. Personal for the Ambassador. I have received through the courtesy of
                            the Cuban Embassy the following telegraphic message from Martínez Fraga:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Cuban Government, having been informed in detail of the
                                    matters agreed to in principle in our conversations at
                                    Washington, has decided to ratify its approval which was cabled
                                    on July 31. The Senate will take up and, we hope, will approve
                                    the Obligations Bill on next Tuesday the 8th and we are
                                    preparing to obtain the immediate approval of the House. The
                                    observations concerning bills pending on other matters are being
                                    studied. The Government considers it of the utmost urgency to
                                    obtain, following the adjournment of the American Congress, an
                                    announcement of the willingness of your Government to arrange
                                    with Cuba to advance 20 millions for a Stabilization Fund
                                    because the continuance of the Cuban monetary crisis,
                                    notwithstanding the drastic measures which have been adopted may
                                    force the adoption of other measures not yet contemplated if it
                                    does not possess an adequate instrument in order to dominate the
                                    crisis. In addition the said announcement will consolidate the
                                    position of this Government in order to carry out with all speed
                                    the plan agreed upon and will make very much easier our dealings
                                    with Congress.</p>
                                <p>I therefore reiterate my request to Ambassador Butler Wright that
                                    he should report to you concerning this matter. Furthermore I
                                    personally believe that the arrangement of the advance would
                                    give great strength to the Government in relation to the
                                    confidential steps relative to the Memorandum of which you are
                                    aware. As Ambassador Butler Wright doubtless will have informed
                                    you, we have powerful reasons to feel optimistic and we think
                                    that we are on the eve of solving all these difficulties.</p>

                        <p>Please seek immediate opportunity to inform Martínez Fraga that while, as
                            I told him when he was here, this Government has every disposition and
                            desire to be helpful in the present emergency, it cannot take any step
                            such as the desired announcement relative to the eventual financial
                            collaboration of this Government until Cuba has taken the necessary
                            steps to settle satisfactorily and equitably the legitimate claims of
                            American citizens against Cuba. Until the agreements which the Cuban
                            Government has entered into with these creditors are implemented through
                            the enactment of the necessary legislation, this Government would not
                            have the necessary support of public opinion which it anticipates once
                            Cuba has acted and which it must have if collaboration with Cuba is to
                            be fully effective. In this respect, the situation has not changed from
                            that described in the note of July 20 to the Cuban Government and the
                            covering instructions, except that as a result of my subsequent
                            conversations with Martínez Fraga, and of the assurances which Martínez
                            Fraga gave me, I agreed to postpone our announcement suspending the
                            negotiation of the supplemental trade agreement. Once these assurances
                            have been translated into concrete action, this Government will be ready
                            and prepared to undertake the fullest consideration of whatever projects
                            Cuba may wish to advance for a stabilization fund or construction
                            projects financed in whole or in part by the Export-Import Bank. With
                            regard to the stabilization fund, preliminary studies made here indicate
                            the necessity for a careful definition of the size and operation of such
                            a fund. The amount of 20 million would seem to be much greater than
                            required. Three to five million dollars would seem sufficient on the
                            basis of present information. It might be well to remind Martínez Fraga
                            that the Congress here in discussing the proposal for an increase in the
                            lending power of the Export-Import Bank, which unfortunately was not
                            adopted, made it unmistakably clear that it did not consider as the
                            principal function of the Bank the use of its funds for exchange
                            stabilization purposes.’ In view of the security which can be offered in
                            this case, however, the Cuban Government may wish to endeavor to secure
                            the financial accommodation it requires from private banks. As
                            previously indicated, as and when the two Governments reach the stage of
                            financial collaboration, this Government will be pleased, if the Cuban
                            Government so desires, to place at the disposal of the Cuban Government
                            the experience of American monetary experts.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum referred to in Martínez Fraga’s cable contains informal
                            comment and suggestions regarding the moratorium legislation. A copy of
                            this memorandum was sent Mr. Beaulac<note n="39" xml:id="d530fn39">Willard L. Beaulac, First Secretary of Embassy in Cuba.</note> by

                            express my deep appreciation for the efforts which Martínez Fraga is now
                            making to pave the way for the eventual financial collaboration of this
                            Government.</p>

                            the Under Secretary of State of the United States have cleared the way

                            only, although to its regret, limit itself to maintaining and
                            reiterating the intent of its note of July 23d last in explanation of a

                        <p>Moreover, the delay in these negotiations, the justified hope for their

                            intentions contained in the plan of economic cooperation already agreed
                            upon, which the Government of Cuba is prepared, so far as concerns that
                            part which devolves upon it, to carry out immediately and in a formal
                            manner.”</p>
                        <p>My Government does not conceal its serious fear that if, unfortunately,
                            the difficult situation in which these negotiations now appear to be,
                            does not permit the Government of the United States to postpone the
                            publication of its Note, there would be created—because of its
                            obligation to justify its position before public opinion—a delicate
                            situation for the Government of Cuba, which has demonstrated by acts,
                            its intention of fulfilling all the obligations which rest upon it under
                            the plan, in the confidence that the Government of the United States, on
                            its part, would not delay complying with the obligations which it has
                            assumed in the course of these negotiations conducted within the noble
                            tradition of close friendship always existing between the peoples of
                            Cuba and of the United States.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of Your Excellency’s note of August 17, no. 1417, in
                                reply to my note of August 15 in which I informed you that the
                                Government of the United States had fixed the 31st of August, 1939,
                                as the date on which, in the absence of the developments described
                                in my note of July 20, a public announcement will be made to the
                                effect that negotiations for a supplementary trade agreement between
                                our two Governments have been indefinitely suspended.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency’s note expresses the hope that recent conversations
                                between the Ambassador of Cuba in Washington and the Under Secretary
                                of State of the United States have cleared the way to a satisfactory
                                solution of all the problems cordially examined by both Governments
                                and refers to the situation created by this Government’s note of
                                August 15, at the same time reiterating the stand taken in Your
                                Excellency’s note of July 23.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency’s note also contains a suggestion, made in
                                fulfillment of instructions from the President of the Republic of
                                Cuba, for the making of “simultaneous declarations on the part of
                                both Governments in which they would announce at once their cordial
                                intentions contained in the plan of economic cooperation already
                                agreed upon, which the Government of Cuba is prepared, as far as
                                concerns that part which devolves upon it, to carry out immediately
                                and in a formal manner”.</p>
                            <p>This suggestion implies that there is in existence an agreement for
                                economic cooperation between the two Governments involving mutual
                                obligations. I wish to reiterate what I have frequently stated to
                                Your Excellency and to other officials of the Cuban Government to
                                the effect that no agreement of this nature is in existence or could
                                be arrived at until the Cuban Government shall have taken steps to
                                restore its international credit, including the discharging of those
                                recognized obligations toward American citizens which have
                                frequently been discussed with Your Excellency and which were
                                described in my note of July 20.</p>
                            <p>It is only after these steps have been taken by the Government of
                                Cuba that my Government will be in a position to translate into
                                positive action its frequently expressed willingness to cooperate in
                                economic matters with Your Excellency’s Government, the first step
                                in such cooperation being a careful study of the possibilities of
                                the situation and of the specific proposals which Your Excellency’s
                                Government may wish to advance.</p>
                            <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0554"/>
                            <p>With reference to the penultimate paragraph of your note, I wish to
                                point out that the obligations of the Cuban Government to which you
                                refer existed prior to the discussions last November of the
                                possibility of a plan of economic cooperation between the two
                                Governments and that the binding effect of these obligations upon
                                the Cuban Government could in no way have been strengthened by, or
                                much less made contingent upon, the implementation of the expressed
                                willingness of this Government to extend credits for a
                                self-liquidating program of public works in Cuba or to negotiate a
                                supplementary trade agreement.</p>

                            <p>I delivered yesterday to the Secretary of State at 12 o’clock our
                                Note No. 250, which is textually identical with the draft enclosed
                                in the Department’s instruction No. 1091 of August 25, 1939. As
                                Ambassador Martínez Fraga was with the Secretary of State at that
                                time, I deemed it wiser to leave these gentlemen to a discussion of
                                the Note in question rather than to attempt to discuss it with them
                                at that time. It was understood that we would have a further
                                conversation at 11 o’clock this morning.</p>
                            <p>At 11 o’clock this morning I called at the Cuban Department of State
                                and found that Ambassador Martínez Fraga was detained elsewhere. The
                                Secretary said that he was compelled to observe that although Cuba
                                would have fulfilled a part of her undertaking with us, if and when
                                the legislation for the “Obligaciones” were passed, there was no
                                indication that the Government of the United States was bound to
                                fulfill her portion of the agreement: deeming it wiser to overlook
                                the intimation of lack of good faith on our part contained <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0555"/>in his remark, I stated
                                that—as had been set forth in the Note which I delivered to him
                                yesterday—there had been no question of any written commitment or
                                agreement on our part, save the assurance which I trusted that he
                                and his Government had always accepted that we would immediately
                                undertake the examination of the public works project and the
                                extension of the other means of financial support and advice. This
                                was, however, predicated upon the fulfillment of the conditions
                                enumerated in my Note of July 20.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary said—as Batista has intimated to me many times
                                before—that he would have to have something to exhibit to the people
                                of Cuba in return for the passage of the “Obligaciones”. He then
                                handed me the attached draft of a proposed statement to the
                                    press<note n="50" xml:id="d534fn50">Not printed.</note> intended
                                for publication should the “Obligaciones” be passed by both Houses
                                of Congress and signed by the President, and requested an expression
                                of my opinion thereon. After reading it hurriedly, I informed him
                                that there was no possibility that my Government would acquiesce in
                                the statement therein concerning any agreement to contribute toward
                                the Stabilization Fund, and I added that the position of my
                                Government had been made additionally clear in the telegram<note n="51" xml:id="d534fn51">Telegram No. 96, August 7, <ref target="#pg_540">p. 540</ref>.</note> which Mr. Welles had
                                sent to Ambassador Martínez Fraga through me, and which I had also
                                allowed the Secretary to read: I therefore suggested that he
                                definitively exclude from the draft those words which referred to
                                such an alleged agreement.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the allusion to the $50,000,000 credit, I said that I
                                thought the time had come for me to inquire where and at what time
                                that figure had arisen: the Secretary made the astounding reply that
                                he really did not know, but that he had understood that such was the
                                extent of the credits intended. I said—as emphatically as I
                                could—that there was no ground whatsoever for any such figure or,
                                for that matter, of any specified figures; that we had ignored its
                                continued appearance in the press of Cuba because it hardly seemed
                                worthwhile to deny it; but that I could state categorically that
                                there was no ground for the mention of such sum—no matter what was
                                the origin of the rumor. The Secretary thereupon suggested that the
                                figure be struck from the draft: I said that would be the best
                                method of at last putting an end to such a rumor.</p>
                            <p>I then said that I would have to submit the proposed draft to my
                                Government which I undertook to do by telephone—stating that I hoped
                                to inform him tomorrow of such instructions as I might receive.</p>
                            <p>I thereupon called Mr. Briggs<note n="52" xml:id="d534fn52">Ellis O.
                                    Briggs, Assistant Chief, Division of the American
                                    Republics.</note> by telephone and acquainted him in the sense
                                of the foregoing. He called me at 4 o’clock in order to communicate
                                to me a corrected draft to which the Government of the United States
                                would have no objection, provided that the Public <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0556"/>Works Bill were passed by both
                                Houses of Congress and signed by the President.</p>
                            <p>He reminded me that there were other conditions specified in our Note
                                of July 20th which remain to be complied with. I told Mr. Briggs
                                that I was continually aware of that fact and was convinced that if
                                and when the Bill were passed, this Government would immediately
                                request and expect a gesture upon our part. I said that the
                                extension of the Export-Import Bank credits had been originally
                                dependent upon the passage of the Public Works Bill, but that the
                                situation had become further aggravated by recent legislation to a
                                point where these additional matters had been specified in my Note
                                of July 20th. I told him, however, that the Revaluation Bill now
                                appeared to be taking second place, that I believed that continued
                                representations which had been made by all interested parties were
                                having some effect, and that there was a good chance that the
                                measure would be greatly modified or made finally to conform to our
                                observations; that the Monetary Law merely awaited the inclusion of
                                the Regulations in an amended law in order to comply without
                                representations in the matter—in addition to the elimination of the
                                retroactive feature which had been advocated by the interested
                                banks; that the Tax Bill—although not forming a part of the
                                situation of which we had complained—constituted a serious menace to
                                American interests but was understood to have already undergone the
                                deletion of a large number of its objectionable features.</p>
                            <p>In other words, these three measures might fall, largely of their own
                                weight: in view whereof I ventured to recommend that if and when the
                                Obligations were definitively out of the way, we might proceed to
                                the next step, which would be the designation of an engineer of the
                                Export-Import Bank who would immediately come to Cuba to examine the
                                possibilities for the extension of credits for productive public
                                works. I said that such elasticity of interpretation might save us
                                the embarrassment of reiterated accusations of lack of good faith
                                and that I believed that such an undertaking would not necessarily
                                commit us to definite action, unless or until the other requirements
                                had been fulfilled by Cuba.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Briggs stated that the suggestion was worthy of consideration and
                                that it would be immediately taken under advisement.</p>

                            <p>The Cuban Ambassador to Washington called upon me today. He stated
                                that yesterday he had had a long and spirited conversation with
                                Colonel Batista, at which he was accompanied by Señor Amadeo López
                                    Castro.<note n="53" xml:id="d535fn53">Cuban Secretary of
                                    Agriculture.</note> In the course of this conversation, Dr.
                                Martínez Fraga stated that he had given a resume of the entire
                                situation, together with an expression of his opinion as to the
                                inevitable results. He himself had set the date of September 7th as
                                the earliest date upon which his Government could safely count on
                                the necessary two thirds majority for the passage of the
                                “Obligaciones”: it is therefore pursuant to his recommendation that
                                the Senate has been convened for that date. He said that one of the
                                reasons for the selection of this date was that Senator Pujol had
                                only left last night in order to get into touch with Senator Font
                                wherever he may be and to bring him back with him to Cuba (giving
                                him the necessary assurances in connection with the incident which
                                caused his sudden departure from Cuba).</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that he considered this to be the very last
                                effort that he would make in this connection and then proceeded to
                                outline to me his present position. He said that he had inquired of
                                Colonel Batista whether it could be considered a fair return for his
                                ceaseless efforts to accomplish the passage of this legislation, to
                                request that he remain on as Ambassador to the United States when he
                                had every reason to believe that if he registered as a candidate
                                with the Constituent Assembly he could be elected (and if not to the
                                Constituent Assembly to the Senate). Today, however, is the last
                                date permitted for the registration of candidates for the
                                Constituent Assembly. He said that he was informed in reply that he
                                should not think of relinquishing his present post and therefore he
                                would not submit his name as a candidate—in the hope that the Senate
                                would on September 7th pass this legislation. He asked that Mr.
                                Welles be informed of all of the foregoing.</p>
                            <p>I then showed him the text of the announcement which we proposed to
                                make on the morning of September 1st (see the Department’s
                                instruction No. 1089 of August 23,<note n="54" xml:id="d535fn54">Not
                                    printed; it transmitted a copy of the announcement which the
                                    Department proposed to release on August 31 regarding an
                                    indefinite suspension of negotiations for a supplementary trade
                                    agreement (611.3731/2130).</note> and telegram No. 100 of August
                                    <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0558"/>29<note n="55" xml:id="d535fn55">Not printed.</note>): I did not give him a
                                copy but I said that I proposed to communicate it to the Secretary
                                of State tomorrow (August 31). The Ambassador asked whether I
                                thought it might be possible to postpone this announcement in order
                                to await the developments on September 7th. I said that I would
                                refer his inquiry to Mr. Welles, but that I felt absolutely certain
                                that we could no longer postpone the date of this announcement—which
                                had already been postponed in the hope that the bill might be
                                passed. The Ambassador then said that it would be wise to make a
                                similar announcement here at the same time, which would closely
                                follow the announcement to be made by the Department: I read to him,
                                in reply, the last paragraph of the Department’s instruction No.
                                1089 of August 23, and stated that he would observe that my
                                Government had foreseen such a desire on the part of the Cuban
                                Government and had stated that it would be desirable that such
                                action be taken simultaneously. The Ambassador then stated that the
                                phraseology of the last sentence of the proposed statement for the
                                press left the door open for the resumption of negotiations which he
                                earnestly hoped might be the case, as it was the intention of his
                                Government to continue its pressure for the passage of the bill: I
                                replied that I have every reason to believe that such was the idea
                                of the Department in adopting that phraseology.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that, in such case, he assumed that facilities
                                would be afforded for the proposal of items, etc., that had not been
                                advanced before: I replied that I had no knowledge as to what forms
                                such negotiations might take, but that he was doubtless aware that
                                it would entail the reopening of the entire procedure before the
                                Committee on Reciprocity Information. He replied that he did.</p>
                            <p>I then mentioned to him the matter of the statement to the press to
                                which the Secretary of State had referred in his conversation with
                                me yesterday: the Ambassador replied that he greatly regretted that
                                he had not been able to be present at that meeting because he
                                considered the proposal to be inopportune and not founded upon
                                facts: in fact, he volunteered the information that the Secretary
                                knew very little about it! In order to make our position clear, I
                                stated that it would have been impossible for us to agree to any
                                notice which included reference to the United States’ contribution
                                toward the Stabilization Fund, or to any statement which specified
                                the sum of $50,000,000 as having been agreed upon: the Ambassador
                                replied that such was, of course, the case and that he very much
                                regretted the proposal. I stated that as the proposal had been
                                submitted to me, and by me to my Government, I had now received the
                                draft of a proposed notice to which my Government would interpose no
                                objection, provided it were clearly understood that the reference to
                                the Supplementary Trade Agreement is, of course, contingent on <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0559"/>whether or not these
                                negotiations are suspended as of September 1st. He said that he
                                believed that no further attention should be paid to the proposal: I
                                replied that I was under obligation to the Secretary of State to
                                make some reply: therefore I requested him to inform the Secretary
                                of State to the above effect (he stated that he was on his way to
                                the Department of State after leaving the Embassy) and further to
                                inform Dr. Campa that I would communicate with him tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>I communicated the foregoing by telephone to Mr. Welles who confirmed
                                our position in the matter. I therefore intend to hand to the
                                Secretary of State tomorrow (August 31st) a copy of the statement to
                                be released on the morning of September 1st for publication in the
                                papers of the afternoon of that date.</p>
                            <p>At 5 o’clock Mr. Welles telephoned me stating that Martínez Fraga had
                                sent a message by telephone to him through the Cuban Embassy stating
                                that the situation was of great delicacy and danger and of great
                                importance to him, assuring him that final and favorable action
                                would be taken on September 7th and asking him to postpone the
                                announcement of the suspension of negotiations until after that
                                date. Mr. Welles stated that he had requested the Embassy in reply
                                to inform the Ambassador that while he greatly regretted the
                                circumstances to which the Ambassador had alluded, he found it
                                impossible to consent to a further postponement of this announcement
                                which had already been postponed: he ventured to believe that the
                                announcement might strengthen the Ambassador’s hand. Mr. Welles
                                requested that I get into immediate touch with the Ambassador and
                                give him the same message.</p>
                            <p>At 6:10 I succeeded in finding the Ambassador and conveyed the
                                foregoing message to him: it apparently reached him before the
                                message through the Embassy in Washington, for he seemed surprised.
                                He said that he hoped that the decision would strengthen his hand
                                but he very much doubted it.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Memorandum of Conversation, by the Ambassador in
                                    Cuba</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Wright</hi>)</head>
                            <p>At 9 o’clock this morning I received a telephone message from the
                                Cuban Department of State asking if I might call upon the Secretary
                                before the regular hour on diplomatic reception day: I replied that
                                I would go to see the Secretary at 10 o’clock, which I did.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary asked me whether I was not perturbed by the situation
                                which was about to be created: I inquired whether he meant the
                                European situation. He replied that that was bad enough, but he
                                thought that our proposal to announce tomorrow the suspension of
                                negotiations for the supplementary trade agreement was fraught with
                                very serious consequences not only for Cuba but for relations
                                between our countries: I said that, with all consideration for his
                                views, I did not share his opinion, for our action was intended to
                                put an end to indefinite and repeated delays and postponements and
                                that I felt constrained to observe that his Government had had ample
                                opportunity for the consideration of this matter since the delivery
                                of my first Note on July 20th last. I said that I had delivered a
                                message of the same import to Ambassador Martínez Fraga
                                    yesterday,<note n="56" xml:id="d536fn56">See <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>
                        </note> conveying, at Mr. Welles’ request, a
                                message from Mr. Welles to the Ambassador in answer to a telephone
                                message which the Ambassador had sent through the Cuban Embassy in
                                Washington, in which Mr. Welles had stated that he regretfully had
                                reached the conclusion that further postponement was impossible. The
                                Secretary said he was aware of this message.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary then said that he requested in the name of the
                                President of the Republic that this decision be postponed until
                                Saturday the 9th of September, and he added that if it were
                                necessary he (the Secretary) would appear before Congress and
                                explain to the members the situation. I replied that in view of the
                                fact that this request came through him from the Chief of State my
                                only alternative was to transmit it immediately to my Government,
                                which I undertook to do.</p>
                            <p>At 11 o’clock (Habana time) I informed Mr. Welles thereof and I
                                stated, in order to aid him in any position he might make, that I
                                believed that at last this Government was thoroughly frightened and
                                had become aware of the effect upon Cuba’s economical and financial
                                position which would inevitably arise from continued disinclination
                                to meet this recognized obligation and the resultant necessity that
                                we should announce the suspension of the aforementioned
                                negotiations: therefore we were in a much stronger position than
                                before and, furthermore, the efficacy of subsequent representations
                                on our part would depend largely upon the consistency with which we
                                maintained our position in this matter. I said that on the other
                                hand, however, <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0561"/>we should
                                have to face the probability that, in case of a European war which
                                seemed so imminent, Cuba would obtain a higher and practically
                                limitless market for her sugar which might change certain aspects of
                                the situation entirely. I said further that a friendly Cuba—perhaps
                                achieved by reasonable elasticity in this matter, might be of
                                greater value to us than an antipathetic Cuba—possibly brought about
                                by insistence upon the letter of the agreement. Mr. Welles stated
                                that he would think it over and call me later.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile the Embassy was informed that as a direct result of our
                                insistence that the provisions of the treaty be observed with regard
                                to the exportation of pineapple slips, the long-standing matter of
                                the exportation of 2,000,000 of these slips to Puerto Rico was
                                satisfactorily settled. From what we have been able to learn from
                                all sources, a satisfactory solution of this treaty obligation would
                                not have been achieved otherwise.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>At 2 o’clock (1 o’clock Washington time), Mr. Welles called me and
                                stated that in view of the source of this latest request and of his
                                high regard for the President, he could not do otherwise than accede
                                thereto, with the understanding, however, that the postponement of
                                the date of the announcement of our intention to suspend
                                negotiations would be extended until September 9th, and that my
                                Government would find it impossible to agree to a further
                                postponement. As the Secretary of State had asked several times in
                                the interim whether I had received a reply, I deemed it advisable to
                                inform him in the sense of the above and to request, through him, an
                                interview with the President, in order to avoid any possible
                                inference on his part that I had been instructed or desired to deal
                                with the President behind the Secretary’s back. An appointment was
                                made for 5:15 o’clock.</p>
                            <p>At that hour I saw the President who was very cordial and seemingly
                                unconcerned. I delivered the message orally as above described: he
                                requested me to inform Mr. Welles not only of his high regard, but
                                also of his appreciation of the attitude which he had assumed. He
                                said nothing about the latent dangers of the situation, but he
                                stated unequivocally that his Government would do everything in its
                                power to secure the passage of this legislation by both Houses on
                                the 7th.</p>
                            <p>I improved the opportunity to remind him that, although such action
                                would be a great step forward, there were certain other points
                                contained in my note of July 20th upon which the fulfillment of the
                                entire program of assistance and cooperation were dependent. I asked
                                whether I might again bring them to his recollection in order that
                                there may be no misunderstanding: he replied that he would be glad
                                to hear any observations that I had to offer.</p>
                            <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0562"/>
                            <p>I first cited the Morris Claim. The President replied that this was,
                                of course, an acknowledged debt of the Cuban Government based upon a
                                ruling of the Supreme Court, but that the determination of the final
                                amount must depend upon the examination which Dr. Cataya was
                                conducting and the results of his conferences with the
                                representatives of the claimants. Our ground as to the final amount
                                of this claim is so uncertain and we have so little information as
                                to what the claimants would actually accept that I deemed it wiser
                                to pursue this subject no further. I had in mind, however, the
                                suggestion made by Martínez Fraga to Mr. Welles that if and when the
                                “Obligaciones” Bill is passed, a request might be made of Warren

                                original issue. I did not mention this, however, nor do I believe
                                this method of settlement would necessarily be practicable or
                                acceptable.</p>
                            <p>I recalled to his attention the undertaking that he had given me that
                                the Regulations under the Monetary Law would be embodied in that
                                Law. The President replied that a provision to that effect was
                                included in the Tax Bill. I did not discuss with him the point as to
                                whether such was the proper place for it to appear, but I infer that
                                this expedient is intended to overcome the necessity of remedial
                                legislation directed to this point alone.</p>
                            <p>I then referred to the Tax Bill—improving the reference which the
                                President had made thereto and I said that, although I had
                                understood that many of the features of the bill which had been
                                deemed objectionable by certain interests, both Cuban and American,
                                had been eliminated, there still remained provisions which were in
                                conflict with the Reciprocal Trade Treaty. He appeared visibly
                                interested at this observation and asked whether I could indicate
                                which they were: I replied that I had that day addressed to the
                                Secretary of State a memorandum concerning the proposed tax of six
                                percent on money exported from the country, and that I had recalled
                                to the attention of the Secretary of State the attitude which we had
                                taken regarding a similar proposed tax in 1937,<note n="58" xml:id="d536fn58">Correspondence not printed.</note> on the same
                                grounds. The President stated that it might be helpful to know the
                                points in the Tax Bill which we considered at variance with the
                                Treaty: I replied that I would immediately follow this suggestion
                                and would submit to the Secretary in due course a memorandum to that
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>I then referred to the Revaluation Bill and said, quite frankly, that
                                Ambassador Martínez Fraga had acquainted me with the general program
                                to be followed: i. e. that the matter would be discusssed in <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0563"/>the House as a result of
                                which amendments would undoubtedly be suggested which would
                                necessitate discussion by the Joint Committee of the House and
                                Senate; that the President will then view the situation in the light
                                of all the existing circumstances and may be able to indicate his
                                opinions either by suggested compromise or, in the last analysis, by
                                veto. The President said that that was exactly his intention and
                                that he was reserving his decision until that time—when he would
                                give the matter his close attention and would decide matters
                                according to his best judgment. I asked him whether he recalled the
                                observations which the Chamber of Commerce had had the honor to
                                present to him with regard to the Tax Bill: he said that he did and
                                that he thought it was an admirable document. I asked him whether
                                there had been brought to his attention the observations by the
                                American Chamber of Commerce and other sources and individuals,
                                concerning the Revaluation Bill: he replied in the affirmative. I
                                asked him whether he had seen the memorandum which our Department of
                                State had informally communicated to Ambassador Martínez Fraga on
                                the date of the latter’s departure from Washington and which
                                Martínez Fraga had translated for Colonel Batista: he replied that
                                he had not. I said that I would either request Ambassador Martínez
                                Fraga to supply him with a copy of the translation or, if it might
                                be understood that I would do so unofficially, I would undertake to
                                do so myself: he replied that he would give it immediate
                                attention.</p>

                            October 16, 4 p.m.,<note n="59" xml:id="d537fn59">Not printed.</note> I
                            have the honor to report that the President’s veto of the bill to
                            liquidate the moratoria was sent to the Congress with the following
                            message (translation): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In exercising a constitutional power by returning to the
                                    Congress, with my observations, the bill to liquidate the
                                    moratoria, I declare that this act does not involve anything
                                    which affects the respect and obedience due to the legislative
                                    power, or the ties of consideration and close affection which
                                    bind me to the authors of the bill, and especially to Colonel
                                    Batista, who was the initiator of the fundamental idea which the
                                    Congress carried out in, according to my judgment, a mistaken
                                    manner.</p>
                                <p>“The Legislative Power, in exercise of its prerogatives, has
                                    voted what it believes should be an adequate solution.</p>
                                <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0564"/>
                                <p>“The Executive Power, likewise in exercise of its prerogatives,
                                    has vetoed the bill.</p>
                                <p>“It is now up to the Congress of the Republic to reconsider or to
                                    accept my veto.</p>
                                <p>“If it does the first I shall adhere to the legislative decision
                                    like a man respectful of the law. If it does the second I shall
                                    be prepared to cooperate within my powers toward a solution of
                                    the difficulty which faces us, offering the poor gift of my
                                    experience and my will to the service of the Republic.”</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>Colonel Batista said to reporters, after reiterating his attachment to
                            the President: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is up to the Congress now to decide, and I hope that it will
                                    decide as quickly as the seriousness of the matter demands.
                                    Congress also can make use of its prerogatives, and the
                                    President—of this I am sure—will be as respectful of the
                                    exercise of that right by the Congress as the latter is of the
                                    right exercised by the head of the nation.</p>
                                <p>“As far as I am concerned I shall respect those decisions,
                                    maintaining as I have said before, the same opinion and the same
                                    will as heretofore.”</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>A part of the press states that Colonel Batista has already taken steps
                            to endeavor to induce the Congress to override the President’s veto. It
                            is not generally believed, however, that proponents of the bill have a
                            two-thirds majority in both Houses of Congress and there is a good deal
                            of doubt, therefore, that an effort actually will be made to override
                            the veto.</p>
                        <p>If the bill is not to be passed over the President’s veto, there are two
                            possible courses open to the Congress: (1) to endeavor immediately to
                            pass a bill which will be more pleasing to the Executive Power, or (2)
                            to postpone a solution of the question by the enactment of legislation
                            which would further delay mortgage foreclosure proceedings until such
                            time as the problem can be adequately dealt with. From the point of view
                            of Cuba’s credit, of course, it is preferable that the problem be solved
                            at once.</p>
                        <p>As stated, both the President and Colonel Batista have made it clear that
                            the former’s veto of the bill does not involve any estrangement between
                            the two. Last night they and their wives, together with the Secretary of
                            State and Mrs. Campa, attended the opera together, and their
                            photographs, taken in a box at the National Theatre, adorn the front
                            pages of this morning’s press.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Distinguished Under Secretary and Friend</hi>: In
                            accordance with the confidential conversations which I had the pleasure
                            of having with <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0565"/>you shortly
                            before going to Habana on the nineteenth instant, I take pleasure in
                            advising you that I discussed, in Cuba, with the Honorable President of
                            the Republic and the Secretary of the Treasury the possibility of
                            initiating, with the friendly cooperation of the Government of the
                            United States, the opportune negotiations which would enable the Cuban
                            Government to solve the urgent and extremely grave problem represented
                            by the depreciation of its national currency.</p>
                        <p>As I stated to you in the course of the conversations referred to above,
                            the depreciation of the Cuban peso continues and frequently becomes
                            worse, in spite of the measures and provisions, many of them risky,
                            adopted and put into force by my Government.</p>
                        <p>It is unnecessary to point out here the dangerous repercussions which
                            such an anomalous situation has on the economic and financial relations
                            between Cuba and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The experts believe that, if the depreciation is not remedied without
                            loss of time, it will become endemic and, complicated by inevitable
                            phenomena of lack of confidence, speculation and general economic
                            insecurity, may nullify the generous efforts which our two Governments,
                            in felicitous agreement, are realizing in other important fields.</p>
                        <p>The exceptional and difficult nature of the monetary depreciation,
                            aggravated in the case of Cuba by the nonexistence of a central
                            government bank which could prevent it in an adequate manner, explains,
                            perhaps, the failure of the numerous attempts and heroic measures by
                            means of which my Government has sought to solve so complex a
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Taking advantage of the cordial personal promise which you were good
                            enough to make me in the sense of considering and studying
                            confidentially the possibility of giving to Cuba the technical, and,
                            should occasion arise, monetary cooperation which will permit the
                            establishment of what, in the opinion of all the experts, is the basis
                            of the solution, that is to say, a solid Stabilization Fund, and,
                            complying with the confidential instructions of my Government, I take
                            the liberty of enclosing a memorandum<note n="60" xml:id="d538fn60">Not
                                printed.</note> explaining what, in our opinion, might serve as a
                            guarantee for the lending operation on which, naturally, must be founded
                            the monetary cooperation to which I have just referred.</p>
                        <p>Equally substantial and important as this latter aspect of the solution,
                            without doubt, is the advice or plan which the experts in the service of
                            the Government of the United States might offer and suggest for the
                            purpose of creating the Stabilization Fund.</p>
                        <p>I, therefore, reiterating each and every one of the reasons of various
                            kinds, which I have personally set forth to you on former occasions,
                            respectfully request that, if it be possible, you consider the request
                                <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0566"/>of the Government of Cuba
                            that this letter formulates, and submit the possibility of this urgent
                            collaboration to the competent authorities and experts concerned, thus
                            adding one more to the long list of generous services and invaluable
                            proofs of friendship offered by the Administration of President
                            Roosevelt and by you to my country.</p>
                        <p>You will note that the enclosed memorandum only describes the history,
                            nature, and status of the possible guarantee for the previously
                            mentioned lending operation. Purposely, we do not even suggest the
                            general lines of a plan for the desired Stabilization Fund because we
                            wish the experts, whose authority is universal, on whom the Government
                            of the United States relies, to be the ones who, by means of their
                            valuable advice, shall determine at least the broad bases of the plan
                            which it would be appropriate to follow.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: You will recall that pursuant to
                            conversations with officials of your Government which established a
                            mutual readiness to undertake the negotiation of a supplemental trade
                            agreement between the United States and Cuba, there was issued by my
                            Government on November 30, 1938 a public announcement<note n="62" xml:id="d539fn62">Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press
                                    Releases</hi>, December 3, 1938, pp. 398–400.</note> of
                            intention to negotiate such an agreement, together with an accompanying
                            list of products, the text of this announcement and list having
                            previously been shown to you and having received your concurrence on
                            behalf of your Government.</p>
                        <p>The public hearings scheduled by this announcement were duly held in
                            Washington on January 3 and 4, 1939, and thereafter the appropriate
                            Departments of my Government have been engaged in making the customary
                            studies of the information received orally and in writing as a result of
                            the announcement in question. These studies having been sufficiently
                            completed, I now have the honor to submit, in the form of the memorandum
                            which is enclosed,<note n="63" xml:id="d539fn63">Not printed.</note> the
                            proposals of my Government with respect to the modification and
                            amplification of the <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0567"/>provisions
                            of Schedules I and II of the existing trade agreement<note n="64" xml:id="d539fn64">Signed at Washington August 24, 1934, <ref target="frus1934v05#pg_169">

                                    169</ref>.</note> between our countries which it is the purpose
                            of the projected supplemental negotiations to effect.</p>
                        <p>Studies are also being made at the present time of certain questions
                            related to the general provisions of the existing agreement, as well as
                            of certain special problems affecting the trade between our countries.
                            Upon the completion of these studies at an early date it is anticipated
                            that certain further proposals respecting these matters will be
                            formulated and that such proposals will accordingly be communicated to
                            you in the near future.</p>
                        <p>In the formulation of the proposals relative to Schedules I and II of the
                            existing trade agreement, account was taken of the views of your
                            Government as communicated in Your Excellency’s note of February 16,
                                1939,<note n="65" xml:id="d539fn65">Not printed.</note> the receipt
                            of which was acknowledged on March 4, 1939.<note n="65" xml:id="d539fn1">Not printed.</note> With respect to the list of products set forth
                            in your note under reference, as being those on which your Government
                            desired concessions in the proposed supplemental trade agreement, it is
                            noted that the concessions proposed in some instances constitute simply
                            a reaffirmation of concessions already provided in the existing trade
                            agreement. Since it is proposed to negotiate simply a supplemental
                            agreement which will leave the existing agreement undisturbed except in
                            respect of those specific provisions which may be the subject of
                            modification in the proposed supplemental agreement, it is manifestly
                            unnecessary to provide specifically for the continuance of existing
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the remaining products mentioned in this connection on
                            behalf of your Government, I must point out that in my Government’s
                            public announcement of November 30, 1938 regarding the proposed
                            negotiations, which as I have mentioned was previously brought to your
                            attention, it was stated that, unless further announcement were made,
                            consideration of changes in import duties applicable to Cuban products
                            imported into the United States would be confined to products enumerated
                            in a list which accompanied the announcement in question, which was also
                            brought to Your Excellency’s attention. In order therefore to consider
                            the possibility of granting new or additional concessions on products
                            mentioned in Your Excellency’s note of February 16 but not included in
                            the list published by my Government on November 30, it would be
                            necessary for my Government to issue further public announcement listing
                            such products, to hold additional public hearings, and to await the
                            subsequent completion of the necessary studies by the appropriate
                            Government Departments. Since this would necessitate an extended
                            deferment of the conclusion of the proposed negotiations for a
                            supplemental agreement, and <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0568"/>since it is presumed that in the view of your Government as well as of
                            mine the expeditious conclusion of these negotiations is to be desired,
                            the proposals formulated on behalf of my Government and communicated
                            herewith are confined, with reference to those affecting rates of import
                            duty in the United States, to products included in the published list
                            which accompanied my Government’s announcement of November 30, 1938.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I wish also to acknowledge the receipt of Your
                            Excellency’s further note of April 13, 1939,<note n="66" xml:id="d539fn66">Not printed.</note> with its enclosures,
                            requesting a reduction in the duty imposed on imports of fresh, chilled,
                            and frozen beef into the United States from Cuba, and to state that your
                            Government’s request has had our sympathetic consideration, but that for
                            the reasons aforesaid it is not deemed practicable to include this
                            matter within the scope of the present negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the proposals of my Government respecting rates of import
                            duty in Cuba, set forth in the enclosed memorandum,<note n="66" xml:id="d539fn99">Not printed.</note> are limited to a moderate list
                            of requests considered by my Government to be a fair equivalent for the
                            proposed additional concessions for the benefit of Cuban products
                            imported into the United States, also set forth in the enclosed
                            memorandum.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted, with respect to sugar, that the quantity of Cuban sugar
                            which may enter the United States, and the amount of such sugar which
                            may enter in the form of direct-consumption sugar are now determined by
                            the quota provisions of the Sugar Act of 1937.<note n="67" xml:id="d539fn67">Approved September 1, 1937; 50 Stat. 903.</note>
                            The announcement which was issued by my Government in connection with
                            the public notice of intention to negotiate the supplementary agreement,
                            in referring to the limited character of the proposed negotiations,
                            stated that in the case of sugar consideration would be given to a
                            further reduction of the import duty on Cuban sugar. It is not possible,
                            therefore, to give consideration to the request of the Cuban Government
                            for an annual sugar quota of 2,000,000 tons, of which 22 percent may
                            enter the United States in a refined state.</p>
                        <p>The proposals contained in Your Excellency’s note of February 16 relating
                            to suggested changes in the general provisions of the existing trade
                            agreement, including the question of a definition of the term “dumping”,
                            and for an addition to the note on pharmaceutical products which is to
                            be found in Schedule I of the existing agreement, as well as the
                            proposal made in Your Excellency’s note of April 5,<note n="66" xml:id="d539fn2">Not printed.</note> relative to Article XI of the
                            existing agreement, are receiving attentive consideration, and my
                            Government’s views on these matters will be communicated to you in
                            connection with its proposals relating to <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0569"/>the general provisions and other special problems,
                            which, as I have said, are expected to be ready for transmittal at an

                                has been transmitted to my Government by the most rapid
                                means.</item>

                                the Government of Cuba to the proposals made by Your Excellency’s
                                Government, I consider it an elementary and urgent duty to clarify
                                certain points noticed in your note of the 24th instant.</item>

                            <item>In effect, Your Excellency kindly refers in the first paragraph of
                                the said note—paraphrased in paragraph one of this note—to the
                                circumstances that both the text of the notice of intention to
                                negotiate, published on November 30, 1938, and the attached list of
                                products which would be the object of hearings were previously shown
                                me and that both obtained the expression of my concurrence
                                    [acuerdo]<note n="69" xml:id="d540fn69">Brackets appear in the

                            <item>I beg Your Excellency to permit me to recall, in my turn, that in
                                the numerous conversations held by the respective officials of our
                                Governments and, particularly, in those which took place during the
                                first weeks of the month of November 1938, the names of the products
                                included in the above-cited list and other products, particularly
                                small fruits and meats, were mentioned and considered. When, on
                                November 29, the text of the notice of intention to negotiate and
                                the annexed list of products were communicated to me, I limited
                                myself to receiving the list and to stating that I would personally
                                forward it to my Government, without expressing or being able to
                                express any concurrence or lack of concurrence. I do not know
                                whether the English word “concurrence” which Your Excellency uses in
                                the paragraph of your note which I am now examining, possesses a
                                meaning different from that expressed by <hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi>. The only action which I should or could have made
                                on the occasion in question was of a material order: to <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0570"/>receive the documents which were
                                kindly offered me for the purpose of transmitting them to my

                            <item>Those documents and their content merely constituted the first
                                formal manifestation of the conversations held until that time
                                between the officials of our respective Governments, but they could
                                in no way signify a basis of negotiation so inflexible as to
                                prohibit my Government from proposing on its side, as it did in the
                                list attached to my note of February 16 of this year,<note n="72" xml:id="d540fn72">Not printed.</note> other modifications or

                            <item>To suppose the contrary would lead us to one of these two absurd
                                situations: <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a pact (a unilateral pact for
                                the reason which I shall set forth below) was practically effected
                                between the officials of our respective Governments who had
                                conducted the preparatory conversations on these negotiations and,
                                accordingly, necessity for negotiation would vanish; or <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) one of the High Contracting Parties, Cuba,
                                accepted (unilaterally, for the reason which I shall set forth
                                below) without the indispensable public hearing, analogous to that
                                which the Government of the United States arranged to hold, certain
                                concessions from among all those mentioned and considered in the
                                preparatory conversations.</item>

                            <item>The unilateral element to which I refer twice in the above
                                paragraph is obvious because the repeated queries made by officials
                                of the Government of Cuba of the officials of the Government of the
                                United States relative to the concessions which this latter
                                Government would naturally request of that of Cuba, as a just
                                equivalent of those which might be granted Cuba, received always as
                                sole reply the statement that a request would be made “for a quota
                                for rice, the product of the soil of the United States and something
                                else”.</item>

                            <item>As a result, the list of products published on November 30 by the
                                notice of intention to negotiate did not constitute and could not
                                constitute for the Government of Cuba or for the Government of the
                                United States a barrier which would exclude future and more or less
                                ample reciprocal proposals of modifications or amplifications by the
                                said Governments to the existing Trade Agreement of 1934.</item>

                            <item>A rapid examination of the list of products of the soil and of
                                    the industry of the United States which Your Excellency so
                                    kindly attached to the note to which I now reply, and which
                                    contains the modifications and amplifications requested by your
                                    Government of that of Cuba in the Cuban customs duties on
                                    imports constitutes the best argument in favor of what I have
                                    just stated, because, in addition to including a request for a
                                    Cuban quota of 90,720,000 kilograms for American rice and a
                                    customs reduction for this product which replaces the present
                                    duty of 1.85 by another of 0.86, it adds twelve requests for <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0571"/>customs reduction and
                                    other requests relative to certain exceptions from duties and
                                    other substantial changes.</item>
                                <label/><item>Finally, as is easily noted, both Your Excellency’s Government
                                    and my Government—in officially formulating their respective
                                    proposals, the former in the note to which I now reply and the
                                    latter in my note of February 16—have both held the just and
                                    correct opinion of considering the preparatory conversations on
                                    these negotiations and the internal acts effected by each
                                    Government for the sake thereof to be mere bases of negotiation
                                    which in no way limit or could limit the field of their
                                    reciprocal proposals.

                            confidential note dated May 25 last I have the honor to write to Your
                            Excellency to inform you that my Government has been pleased to give me
                            the pertinent instructions that I might reply to the confidential note
                            dated the 24th of that month in which Your Excellency was good enough to
                            submit for the consideration of the Government of Cuba, in the form of a
                            memorandum, the proposals of the Government of the United States
                            relative to the modification and amplification of Schedules I and II of
                            the existing Trade Agreement of 1934, and, further, to explain the
                            reasons which oblige your Government to decline to discuss, almost in
                            their entirety, the proposals contained in the memoranda enclosed with
                            this Embassy’s notes of February 16<note n="73" xml:id="d541fn73">Not
                                printed.</note> and April 13<note n="73" xml:id="d541fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> of this year.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Cuba has studied with the greatest attention and with
                            the keenest desire to reach an agreement advantageous to the Republic
                            and to the United States the text of the counter-proposals and
                            explanations communicated in the aforesaid note of May 24.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic has given particular consideration to the
                            fully grounded statements according to which Your Excellency <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0572"/>defines the intention of your
                            Government to negotiate a limited commercial adjustment which,
                            necessarily, places outside the scope of these negotiations a good part
                            of the Cuban proposals contained in the memoranda enclosed with this
                            Embassy’s notes of February 16 and April 13 last.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the disappearance of the specific reasons for urgency
                            which, eight months ago, made it advisable to reduce as much as possible
                            the scope of the contemplated changes in and additions to Schedules I
                            and II of the existing Trade Agreement, my Government agrees in the
                            circumstances with the restrictive view maintained by Your Excellency in
                            your note of May 24 and, desirous of contributing without delay to the
                            greatest success of these negotiations, amends the point of view
                            maintained in this Embassy’s note of February 16 and, for the time
                            being, abandons its firm intention of negotiating a full and
                            comprehensive adjustment of those Schedules, an adjustment which it
                            believes, and desires so to declare, is urgently necessary for the
                            greatest stability and the greatest real and reciprocal benefits from
                            the contractual arrangement regulating trade relations between our
                            respective countries.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic further desires to put on record that it
                            sincerely trusts that it may be possible in the near future, and with
                            the cordial and friendly cooperation of Your Excellency’s Government, to
                            transform into a satisfactory reality the proposal mentioned in the
                            foregoing paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The amendment of the full and comprehensive view given in this Embassy’s
                            notes of February 16 and April 13 and the proposals contained therein
                            requires, in my Government’s opinion, in order that the course of the
                            present negotiations may be efficiently directed, a limited formulation
                            of its proposals which now, of course, must meet the restricted point of
                            view maintained by Your Excellency’s Government and which, as stated
                            above, the Republic’s Government shares and accepts in the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In accord with this restrictive view, my Government, considering all its
                            proposals contained in this Embassy’s notes mentioned above not to have
                            been formulated, considers the products of the soil and industry of Cuba
                            and of the United States specifically mentioned in the enclosed
                                memorandum<note n="75" xml:id="d541fn75">Not printed.</note> to be
                            matter open to discussion and negotiation for the purpose of modifying
                            and amplifying Schedules I and II of the existing Trade Agreement of
                            1934.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic wishes to state that it considers the
                            proposals relative to Cuban sugar and tobacco, formulated in the
                            above-mentioned notes of this Embassy and contained in Your Excellency’s
                            note of May 24, to be measures to repair damages and changes suffered in

                            products of Cuban soil by the existing Trade Agreement, as a result of
                            legal modifications of an internal order which occurred in the United
                            States in 1936 and 1937.</p>
                        <p>The character of just reparation possessed by the Cuban and American
                            proposals relative to sugar and tobacco from Cuba excludes these
                            proposals from the field of discussion or study of reciprocal
                            concessions on the part of the Government of the Republic and,
                            accordingly, places the proposals of the Government of the United States
                            relative to rice, textiles, canned foods, et cetera, which are studied
                            and answered in the enclosed memorandum, in a position to require
                            corresponding compensations in favor of the Government of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>My Government limits its request for such compensation to two of the
                            proposals contained in this Embassy’s notes of February 16 and April 13,
                            which refer to the establishment by the Government of the United States
                            of an import quota on meat, now reduced to five thousand tons, with
                            duties similar to those of Canada and applicable to fresh and chilled or
                            frozen meats, and to a change in the period of time during which entry
                            of Cuban vegetables into the United States is permitted, as proposed in
                            detail in the enclosed memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Favorable consideration of both proposals by Your Excellency’s Government
                            would put my Government in a no less favorable position to discuss and
                            negotiate the concession to your Government of an import quota on rice
                            produced and harvested in the United States, amounting to 90,000,000
                            (ninety million) pounds, with a low duty and in accordance with the
                            specific stipulations contained in the enclosed memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The specific schedules, which I also have the honor to transmit to you,
                            form part of the said memorandum.</p>
                        <p>Allow me, Excellency, to urge with the greatest respect that, if your
                            Government considers it advisable, it inform my Government of the
                            opinion which it may have of the proposals relative to certain changes
                            of a general character, contained in this Embassy’s notes of February 16
                            and April 5.<note n="77" xml:id="d541fn77">Neither printed.</note>

                            conveying the counterproposals of the Government of Cuba with respect to
                            the proposed modification of the existing Trade Agreement of 1934
                            between the United States and Cuba.</p>

                        <p>It is noted that the Government of Cuba considers that the proposals made
                            to it relative to Cuban sugar and tobacco are to be regarded as
                            reparations for damages sustained as a result of changes in the
                            situation which have occurred subsequent to the conclusion of the Trade
                            Agreement of 1934 and consequently as excluded from discussion as
                            subjects for reciprocal concessions on the part of Cuba. It is also
                            noted that the Government of Cuba desires concessions on certain meat
                            products and extension of existing concessions on certain vegetables, in
                            return for which it would be prepared to grant certain specified
                            concessions on American products.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have to advise you that the authority granted to the
                            Executive under the Trade Agreements Act of the United States does not
                            contemplate the reduction of import duties of the United States except
                            in return for reciprocal concessions for American products in foreign
                            markets; and further that, as has been pointed out, it would not be
                            possible for my Government under its established procedure to offer
                            concessions to the Government of Cuba on products not included in the
                            list accompanying my Government’s announcement of November 30, 1938,
                            except after further public announcement and opportunity for the receipt
                            of views from the interested public.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I regret to state that it would not be possible to conclude
                            a trade agreement containing the concessions requested by your
                            Government as outlined in your note under acknowledgement, under the
                            terms of my Government’s announcement of intention to negotiate a
                            supplemental trade agreement with your Government, issued on November

                            of the Sugar Act of 1937 suspending the operation of the quota
                            provisions of that Act as contained in Title II thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Agriculture is issuing a public notice the effect of
                            which will be, in accordance with the note to Item 501 of Schedule II of
                            the Trade Agreement, to raise the Cuban duty on raw sugar to 1.50 cents

                            would otherwise have been issued today because of the failure of the

                                    application to this tariff of the presidential privilege of
                                    reducing it.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Wright observed that although the language used in the
                            penultimate paragraph was obscure in Spanish, the meaning was obviously
                            that Cuba desired to have the duty returned to 90 cents, notwithstanding
                            the suspension of the quota.</p>
                        <p>He said he had telephoned the foregoing at the urgent request of Dr.
                            Martínez Fraga, who was aware that Mr. Welles was about to leave
                            Washington and desired Mr. Welles to receive it at once.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Wright said that the impression seemed general in Cuba
                            (notwithstanding the clear statements which he had made in accordance
                            with the Department’s telegram of September 11) that our action
                            constituted “retaliation” against Cuba for the continued failure of the
                            Cuban Government to act on the various matters—especially the Public
                            Works Debt—in which we were interested. For example, he said that the
                            newspaper <hi rend="italic">Avance</hi> had suddenly come out last night
                            in favor of settlement of the <hi rend="italic">obligaciones</hi>,—action on which had again been promised by the Cuban
                            Ambassador, this time at tomorrow’s session of the Senate. From other
                            sources, including Dr. Mañas, Ambassador Wright hears that the Cubans
                            are “in a negotiating mood”, and believe that something must be done to
                            get the duty back to 90 cents if economic disaster is to be averted. Mr.
                            Wright expressed the further opinion that although the matter would have
                            to be handled with great delicacy, he was not sure that something
                            effective could not shortly be done if we were in a position to make a
                            proposal.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: The personal communication
                                which Tour Excellency made to me yesterday concerning the decision
                                of the Government of the United States to declare abolished the
                                system of quotas which governed the sugar market, on which was
                                specifically based the only important advantage which the Reciprocal
                                Trade Agreement of 1934 offered the people of Cuba following the
                                suspension of the advantages <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0577"/>to our tobacco, has caused a painful impression to my Government
                                which it would be both insincere and useless on my part not to
                                hasten to make known to the Government which Your Excellency so
                                worthily represents. In fact, the disorder which this unexpected
                                measure causes in our national economy is so complete and arouses
                                such deep anxiety in the Cuban people that my Government does not
                                hesitate to request, in a friendly manner, that the Government of
                                the United States consider emergency action with a view to the
                                immediate remedying of this seriously unbalanced situation which,
                                without a doubt causes, with respect to Cuba, a condition of obvious
                                inequality in the field of our reciprocal relations. Fortunately, I
                                cherish the hope that within the instructions received from your
                                Government—which I had the privilege of learning yesterday through
                                the medium of Your Excellency, and which leave open the door for
                                carrying on the negotiations with a view to broadening the Treaty of
                                1934—it may be possible to find a provisional formula which will
                                permit the Government of Cuba—inclined perhaps to reduce the
                                benefits accorded the United States to the limits fixed by the
                                Treaty of 1902<note n="81" xml:id="d545fn81">Signed at Havana,
                                    December 11, 1902, <ref target="frus1903#pg_375">

                                which both countries have derived positive advantages within the
                                brilliant scope which they have attained to their mutual
                                convenience, and to the extent made necessary by the seriousness of
                                the present time.</p>
                            <p>In that regard I do not consider it inopportune to suggest to Your
                                Excellency that if it is the purpose of the Government of the United
                                States in destroying the quota barriers to promote a just balance in
                                prices—a commendable policy which all governments may perhaps have
                                to pursue during this war in order to restrain undue speculation in
                                products of prime necessity—the reestablishment of the current tax
                                of 90 cents imposed on Cuban sugars would further that end.</p>
                            <p>In such a case Cuba would be prepared to sacrifice the unquestioned
                                privilege which the system of quotas represents to her, the
                                re-establishment of which might be considered later when the
                                disagreeable circumstances of the moment will have changed. It is
                                possible that within the broadening of the powers of the Executive
                                Branch of the Union to negotiate reciprocal treaties, there may be
                                found the solution, such, for example, as an exchange of notes
                                between both Governments which would put into effect this
                                provisional regime until there is signed the additional treaty which
                                the Government of Cuba is anxious to enter into in its unshakable
                                desire to establish a new and stronger tie in its friendship with
                                the Government and the people of the United States.</p>

                            supplemental agreement with Cuba in order (1) to restore the duty of

                            suspension of sugar quotas by Presidential proclamation; (2) to insure

                            reestablished; (3) to restore to Cuba the tobacco concessions; and (4)

                        <p>4. For Duggan. Your 8, September 21, 7 p.m. (section 3). I am
                            particularly relieved to know of this very satisfactory decision of the
                            Trade Agreements Organization and of the approval of the Secretary and
                            of Secretary Wallace. With regard to point 1 as stated in your section 3
                            I assume that the restoration of a duty of 90 cents will apply only to
                            Cuban sugars amounting to the total provided for under the quota
                            legislation. Please confirm my understanding or this point.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to have this information you have sent me because of the fact
                            that the entire Cuban delegation which arrives today, I am informed <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0579"/>by Ambassador Martínez Fraga,
                            has been sent solely for the purpose of discussing the sugar problem
                            with me and their attitude during the meeting will undoubtedly depend in
                            large part upon our assurance that we intend to deal fairly with Cuba in
                            this matter.</p>

                            time and that upon his arrival in Habana the Embassy be authorized to
                            make a brief public statement to the effect that negotiations are being
                            undertaken for the conclusion of a supplementary trade agreement which
                            will embrace both the sugar and tobacco questions as well as the
                            solution of matters of interest to the United States. I would further
                            suggest that there be a perfectly clear understanding between the two
                            Governments that while these negotiations would be undertaken and the
                            conclusion of the supplementary trade agreement expedited as much as
                            possible the supplementary agreement if reached will not be made
                            effective until and unless the Cuban Government gives us satisfaction on
                            the questions detailed in our official communications to the Cuban
                            Government of the past few months.</p>
                        <p>This is the tentative understanding I have reached with the Cuban
                            Secretary of State and with Lopez Castro and Martínez Fraga. They are
                            convinced that this is the most effective way of obtaining prompt action
                            by their own Government because of their belief that as soon as public
                            opinion in Cuba knows that a satisfactory supplementary trade agreement
                            has been reached and that its going into effect is only contingent upon
                            the solution of our requests the Cuban Congress would be forced to take
                            favorable action.</p>
                        <p>I am very anxious for obvious reasons to reach a firm understanding in
                            the above sense as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>13. Your 4, September 22, noon. The restoration of the 90-cent duty on
                            Cuban sugar in the proposed supplemental trade agreement <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0580"/>is to be made without reference to any
                            specific amount based upon quota legislation or otherwise. This point
                            was exhaustively discussed both by the Trade Agreements Organization and
                            by other interested officials and the conclusion was reached that the
                            fixing of a tariff <hi rend="italic">quota</hi> would be undesirable
                            because (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) it would tend to hamper the
                            attainment of the President’s objective in suspending the quotas, that
                            is to say, a free flow of sugar to the American market from all sources
                            of supply and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) it would involve administrative
                            and technical difficulties both in Cuba and in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Arrangements have been made for Mr. Grady to see the President upon his
                            return from Hyde Park on Monday. I appreciate fully that it would be
                            helpful to you in securing the cooperation of the Cubans to give them an
                            idea of the nature of the proposition now under study, but in view of
                            the danger of leakage and of the effect which this would have on the
                            market (and possibly in other directions) we believe it might be wisest
                            for us not to disclose its outlines to them until the President’s
                            decision has been obtained and we are ready to take action.</p>

                            decision in this regard and to advise them that a representative of the
                            Department will proceed to Habana in the very near future for the

                        <p>The Ambassador called by appointment to discuss the possibilities of
                            winding up the supplemental trade-agreement negotiations. He <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0581"/>referred briefly to various earlier
                            stages of these negotiations; he indicated that in the existing
                            circumstances it seemed better to conclude the negotiations on a
                            relatively restricted basis, and said that as he saw it this would mean
                            covering three points: (1) the necessary minor adjustments; (2) the
                            tobacco duties; and (3) the sugar question, in connection with which he
                            referred to earlier discussion of a quota concession on rice and
                            indicated that his Government would be prepared to give such a
                            concession as <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for a sugar
                            concession.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Grady said that on the whole the Ambassador’s views seemed to be
                            along the lines of our own: that we had in mind the desirability of
                            winding up the present supplemental trade-agreement negotiations on a
                            restricted basis, leaving to some more propitious time a more general
                            adjustment of economic relations; that we could probably close up
                            negotiations on the various technical questions rather readily, and that
                            the question of the tobacco duties would present no particular
                            difficulty; that with respect to sugar we considered the most desirable
                            solution would be one envisaging restoration of the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> quota removal; that it was important to modify
                            the agreement in such manner as to make sure of the restoration of the
                            ninety cent duty if and when the quotas should be reimposed, but that he
                            could not speak very definitely on this at the moment since we were
                            engaged in discussion with the Department of Agriculture of various
                            aspects of the question of quota reimposition.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador intimated that a mere restoration of the ninety cent duty
                            would not constitute such a concession as he had in mind in speaking of
                            a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> on rice, and asked as to the
                            possibility of a further reduction in the rate, but did not pursue the
                            matter when Mr. Grady indicated that this would not be feasible now; Mr.
                            Grady added that something might perhaps be done by way of providing for
                            maintenance of the ninety-cent rate in the event of a subsequent
                            temporary quota suspension.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he was planning to go to Habana at the end of
                            this week or early next week with a view to personally acquainting the
                            President of Cuba and one or two others with the situation; that he
                            thought we should be prepared with a supplemental agreement ready to be
                            signed when quotas are reimposed. Mr. Grady repeated that we were
                            working on aspects of this question and hoped that he might have
                            something more definite to say a little later, before the Ambassador
                            went to Habana, and would ask him to come in again in a few days.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador called by appointment to receive the draft text<note n="89" xml:id="d552fn89">Not printed.</note> of proposals for
                            conclusion of the supplemental trade-agreement negotiations. The draft
                            which had been previously approved was presented to him and the text was
                            read over with him with appropriate explanations. The Ambassador noted
                            specifically the provision in the sugar note which would effect
                            restoration of the reduced duty upon announcement of the restoration of
                            quotas, without necessarily awaiting the date of their actual
                            restoration.</p>
                        <p>With respect to his proposal on rice it was pointed out to him that the
                            rates and quantities had been left blank because of some doubt whether
                            those he proposed would actually prove a benefit to the American rice
                            industry and thus achieve the desired result. He agreed that it would
                            not be desirable to include this proposal unless it could be formulated
                            in such a manner to be of material interest to the rice producers. It
                            was pointed out to him that the rice association’s interest was now
                            primarily in disposing of an adequate volume and that their earlier
                            views as to margin of preference had been modified; and further that the
                            statistics of imports of American rice into Cuba for the last two years
                            exceed the amount of the proposed quota. Since the proposal would
                            involve a materially higher duty and lower preference on rice imported
                            in amounts exceeding his proposed quota, the net effect might be one
                            disadvantageous to the rice producers or at least regarded by them as
                            making their position in the Cuban market worse rather than better. It
                            developed in the conversation that the Cuban Ambassador had not
                            formulated his proposal on the basis of any recent discussion with
                            persons directly concerned in the marketing of rice in Cuba.
                            Accordingly, at his request Mr. Deimel agreed to communicate with Mr.
                            Reid, Executive Vice President of the Rice Millers Association with a
                            view to developing information which would clarify the matter.</p>

                        <p>As to the remainder of the proposed Schedule I, it was explained to the
                            Cuban Ambassador that this contained merely those items which we had
                            proposed in May and which the Cuban Government had not rejected in the
                            Ambassador’s reply in July; that of the sixteen items other than rice,
                            twelve consisted merely of a writing into the Agreement of customs
                            clarifications and classifications effected by the Cuban Government
                            since the conclusion of negotiations in 1934; that only the remaining
                            four items, Palm Beach cloth, canned salmon, canned mackerel, and canned
                            peanut butter, would effect any improvement in treatment of American
                            trade and that consisted primarily of the insertion of new
                            classifications and rates to bring the duties on these products to a
                            level more nearly corresponding with the rates on closely competitive
                            products. It was pointed out to the Ambassador that some improvement of
                            treatment for American goods was necessary although of course we did not
                            intend to ask for more than was reasonable. The Ambassador indicated
                            that he did not think there would be any difficulty with these
                            items.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that the supplemental agreement would have to be
                            ratified by the Cuban legislature which would require a change in the
                            final article, but that this ratification could be accomplished promptly
                            so that signature Friday or Saturday and ratification Monday might be
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Ambassador called this afternoon to receive and discuss the
                            replies to the observations relating to the supplementary trade
                            agreement which he had handed to Mr. Grady on December 15. The informal
                            memoranda, of which copies are attached,<note n="90" xml:id="d553fn90">Not printed.</note> were handed to him on these points and several
                            additional points of minor technical significance.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador read these over and indicated that they were completely
                            agreeable to him with the exception of the question of exempting certain
                            sugar from the 1940 quota even if it came in after January 1. He said he
                            thought there was some danger that the importers of this sugar in the
                            United States might not consider it in their interest or necessary to
                            pay the duty and clear the sugar before January <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0584"/>1 so that it might be left in customs
                            jurisdiction until next year and be charged against the Cuban quota. I
                            explained that I had discussed this point with Mr. Bernhardt,<note n="91" xml:id="d553fn91">Joshua Bernhardt, of the U. S. Department
                                of Agriculture.</note> who did not seem to feel that this was likely
                            and did not feel that there was any scope in the sugar legislation to
                            alter the practice of charging imports against a quota at the time it is
                            withdrawn from customs custody; that he had not, however, said that I
                            could make a flat statement that this was impossible and that he would
                            look into the question again, although he doubted very much that any
                            possible leeway would be found. I pointed out that in any case it was a
                            matter affecting quota administration rather than the trade
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had no desire to delay the conclusion of the
                            trade-agreement negotiations and suggested leaving it this way: that the
                            trade agreement would be concluded as proposed; that the Department of
                            Agriculture’s belief that there would be no problem of sugar not cleared
                            might prove correct; but that if, say around Christmas, it appeared that
                            the Ambassador’s fears would be realized, that we would then again
                            confer on the situation to see what could be done. I pointed out that I
                            could make no promises as to what might be done, but that I felt sure
                            that we would be glad, if his fears showed any sign of eventuating, to
                            look into the situation with him again to see what, if anything, could
                            be done.<note n="*" xml:id="d553fn1">I later discussed this question
                                with Mr. Grady and Mr. Bernhardt and they both felt that this was
                                the correct answer. Mr. Bernhardt noted that some small amount of
                                sugar in bond might belong to people who would have no special
                                interest in clearing it before the end of the year but did not feel
                                that this would amount to very much, and although he did not feel
                                that there would be any scope in the quota legislation to exempt any
                                such quantity if it came in after the first, nevertheless he felt
                                that one or the other of the governments might find some way of
                                relieving any such situation if it should develop. [Footnote in the
                                original.]</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>I indicated also to the Ambassador that some apprehension had been felt
                            in the Department of Agriculture that if undue advantage were taken of
                            any period during which the duty might be reduced, but before quota
                            limitations were again in effect, to land and clear an extraordinary
                            amount of Cuban sugar, that it would raise difficulty in Congress and
                            probably result ultimately in an equivalent curtailment of Cuban quotas.
                            I did not say that this would happen, but that it was something to bear
                            in mind, in which the Ambassador seemed to concur.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the subject of rice the Ambassador indicated that the
                            suggested method of handling this matter was entirely satisfactory, that
                            he had this question very much at heart, and that he hoped we could
                            discuss it with the Cuban Secretary of Agriculture when he was here next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>We also discussed the time schedule, it being agreed that so far as
                            practicable it would be planned to sign the agreement Monday evening,
                                <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0585"/>release it to our press
                            upon signature for publication in Tuesday morning’s papers, obtain
                            ratification in Cuba on Tuesday and provide for exchange of ratification
                            and proclamation on Wednesday, December 20, so that the agreement can
                            enter into effect Thursday, December 21. I said that we would probably
                            wish to release the text of the agreement with a short press release of
                            four or five pages; that we were working on this press release<note n="92" xml:id="d553fn92">For press release of December 19, see

                            the weekend. I also said that there was some technical change in the
                            sugar note to clarify its intent which Mr. Reinstein was now going over
                            with the Treasury. The Ambassador asked that a clean text of the
                            agreement be provided him in time to send it to Cuba by airmail Sunday
                            evening.</p>

                                Reinstein of the Division of Trade Agreements stated that this
                                memorandum was prepared at the request of the Treasury Department
                                and that since this request was received only three quarters of an

                                not possible to arrange for signature or initialing of minutes by
                                the negotiators. The memorandum was therefore prepared for the
                                signatures of the plenipotentiaries. It was understood with the

                            supplementary trade agreement, shall be understood to mean that, if the

                                of this year informal discussions took place between the American
                                Legation and the Dominican Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding a
                                convention and an enabling act for setting up a Dominican National
                                Bank to replace the receivership of Dominican customs. Exploratory
                                in character, these discussions resulted in a succession of new

                        <p>General Trujillo, accompanied by the Dominican Minister and Mr. Norweb
                            called to see Mr. Duggan late in the afternoon after the tea given by
                            the President and Mrs. Roosevelt at the White House. The General first
                            expressed appreciation for the gracious reception given him at the White
                            House and then indulged in the usual amenities.</p>
                        <p>The first point which the General brought up was his desire to obtain
                            some 4,000 Springfield rifles for the Dominican Army to replace the
                            present Spanish Mausers. Mr. Duggan explained that legislation was now
                            pending in Congress whereby the arsenals, factories, and navy yards of
                            this Government would be authorized to supply certain arms and munitions
                            to the governments of the other American republics, but that
                            unfortunately he did not believe this legislation included authorization
                            for the sale of rifles.</p>
                        <p>General Trujillo said that he had noted that the United States Army was
                            now substituting a new automatic rifle for the Springfield, and that
                            very soon we would have surplus Springfields. He expressed the opinion
                            that perhaps all that would be necessary would be an order <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0588"/>from the President. Mr. Duggan
                            explained again that such authority did not lie exclusively with the
                            President and would probably necessitate an act of Congress, but that
                            when there was a surplus of Spring-fields the Department would be glad
                            to consider a formal request from the Dominican Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Norweb stated that the General was anxious to discuss informally the
                            proposed revision of the Convention of 1924, whereat Mr. Duggan said
                            that we would be most interested in learning at first hand the General’s
                            views, and that he hoped that the General would speak with complete
                            frankness.</p>
                        <p>General Trujillo then said that “if the Government of the United States
                            was really sincere in its desire” to relieve the Dominican people of the
                            existing anomalous situation, there was a “very simple solution” which
                            would be merely for the President of the United States under the
                            authority conferred on him by the Convention to nominate a Dominican
                            citizen as Receiver General of Customs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan replied that this was indeed a completely new idea and that
                            although the proposed solution had the advantage of simplicity, it would
                            require some consideration. Mr. Duggan continued that we had understood
                            all along that Dominican objections with respect to the present special
                            relationship between the two countries were more concerned with the form
                            rather than with personalities. There then ensued some brief discussion,
                            in which it was pointed out to the General that his proposed solution
                            did not absolve the United States Government from any responsibility
                            toward the bondholders, and that it was the sincere desire of the United
                            States in accordance with its general policy so to modify the
                            Convention, if that were possible, as to replace any direct relationship
                            between the two governments by one between an organization representing
                            the bondholders and the Dominican Government under terms which would
                            protect the rights of these bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The General then stated that he felt that the present proposal which
                            involved the transfer of the duties of the Receivership to a “Dominican
                            National Bank” was unsatisfactory, since in effect this bank would be
                            neither “Dominican” nor “national” as the control of its board of
                            directors would be in the hands of foreigners. As Mr. Duggan was out of
                            the room at this moment, Mr. Chapin observed that the form had been
                            chosen advisedly due to the understanding that the Dominican Government
                            wished to found a national bank and since it was felt that the proposed
                            form would be more acceptable to the Dominican Government. General
                            Trujillo stated that the Dominican Government did in fact desire a
                            national bank. There then ensued a general discussion upon Mr. Duggan’s
                            return, as a result of which it was agreed by all that there was no
                            absolute necessity for tying in a national bank plan with the proposed
                            modification <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0589"/>of the Convention.
                            It was suggested that perhaps the National City Bank could be approached
                            with a view to ascertaining whether it would be willing to sell the
                            Dominican branches to the Dominican Government as a separate
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan then referred to one of the earlier drafts for a revision of
                            the Convention of 1924, namely that presented in March 1937,<note n="5" xml:id="d555fn5">
                        <ref target="frus1937v05#pg_453">

                            understood to be Dominican aspirations and which provided for the
                            collection of the customs by a receivership administered by Dominicans
                            under the general supervision of a “customs representative” who with
                            several American assistants would be appointed by the Dominican
                            president from a panel submitted by the Executive Committee of Dominican
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The opinion was expressed that this might be a satisfactory basis upon
                            which to build up new drafts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duggan suggested that the Department would be glad to continue
                            discussions along these lines with the Dominican Minister in the absence
                            of General Trujillo in the hope that some concrete and acceptable plan
                            might be evolved in time to present to General Trujillo upon his return
                            from Europe through the United States to his own country. The General
                            acknowledged somewhat grudgingly this suggestion, but left in an
                            atmosphere of apparent cordiality.</p>

                        <p>Mr. W. W. Lancaster<note n="6" xml:id="d556fn6">Member of the New York
                                law firm of Shearman and Sterling, counsel of the National City Bank
                                of New York.</note> called me yesterday afternoon about five o’clock
                            to say that he had just concluded an hour’s conversation with Señor
                            Pastoriza, the Dominican Minister, who had informed him that he was
                            accompanying General Trujillo to Washington Tuesday morning. He said
                            that the General was prepared to proceed actively with negotiations on
                            the basis of the proposed Dominican Bank Plan for the modification of
                            the 1924 Convention, and is willing to stay as long as two weeks, if
                            necessary, in order to clear up any remaining difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Señor Pastoriza indicated to Mr. Lancaster that the only real point at
                            issue was the method of selecting the Board of Directors of the proposed
                            Dominican National Bank. He said that the Dominican Government had
                            experienced considerable difficulty with the present <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0590"/>fiscal agents, the Guarantee Trust
                            Company, who were very “technical”. When I inquired of Mr. Lancaster
                            whether the possibility of substituting the National City Bank for the
                            Guarantee Trust Company had been discussed, he said that as far as the
                            National City Bank was concerned, while they would be willing to serve
                            if pressed, they would prefer to keep clear of the whole structure. In
                            this connection, Mr. Lancaster said that General Trujillo had observed
                            to Mr. Henneman<note n="7" xml:id="d556fn7">Harry Henneman, vice
                                president, National City Bank of New York.</note> that “the
                            Dominicans did not propose to buy the branches of the National City Bank
                            merely to have that Bank run them”. When informed by Señor Pastoriza
                            that Mr. Henneman had always actively opposed the sale of the Dominican
                            branches to the Dominican Government, since he felt they were a source
                            of profit to the National City Bank, General Trujillo then sent word
                            through Lancaster to the effect that he had not meant to be as abrupt in
                            his statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lancaster stated that he had suggested to Señor Pastoriza that the
                            original board might be constituted by an informal exchange of notes
                            between the Dominican and American Governments. This suggestion was
                            apparently acceptable to Pastoriza. However Mr. Lancaster stated that he
                            did not have any suggestions to offer as to the method of perpetuating
                            the Board of Directors.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that Señor Pastoriza will get in touch with the
                            Department of State shortly after his arrival today.</p>

                            deepest appreciation for all your courtesies during my brief sojourn in

                            course of cooperation in this field, and, however modest their
                            contribution may be, none could be more sincere and definite.</p>
                        <p>May I be allowed to avail myself of this opportunity to call your
                            friendly and personal attention to the only point that disturbs the
                            normality of relations between our two countries. The United States <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0591"/>and the Dominican Republic are
                            bound by a treaty, a product of circumstances and times, that is out of
                            harmony with present trends, whereby our customs are under the control
                            of American officials.</p>
                        <p>That accord had as its purpose to add to the already sufficient guaranty
                            of the American Government for our loans, a machinery for the direct
                            collection of custom funds which would ensure the punctuality of the
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>Our Government has loyally complied with the terms of the pact, however
                            much it may hurt its feelings, and it believes that its immaculate
                            record of eight years of the wisest and most responsible management of
                            public interests and strict discharge of international obligations
                            warrant the revision of a statute that was enacted under circumstances
                            that no longer exist.</p>
                        <p>We know that the Government of the United States is as much interested as
                            the Dominican Government in putting an end to a situation that can
                            hardly be reconciled with the new continental spirit. However, it has
                            occurred to me that, instead of undertaking the tiresome negotiation of
                            a new treaty through ordinary channels, where a certain amount of
                            friction is always bound to appear when questions affecting the
                            sovereignty of a nation are discussed, you, Mr. President, could solve
                            the problem in an equitable and exemplary manner that would take nothing
                            from the guarantee given for the loans, behind which stand both the
                            American and the Dominican Governments. Complicated administrative and
                            legislative tramitation could thus be spared, and the Dominican people
                            could have the moral satisfaction to which they aspire.</p>
                        <p>May I suggest that you could appoint as General Receiver of Dominican
                            Customs a citizen of my country, or else leave that post unfilled,
                            thereby giving our Government the opportunity of exercising its own
                            authority and appointing the new official itself. In no way are these
                            suggestions, I think, in conflict with the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Article I of the pact that rules this question says: “That the President
                            of the United States shall appoint a General Receiver of Dominican
                            Customs who, with such Assistant Receivers and other employees of the
                            Receivership as shall be appointed by the President of the United States
                            in his discretion, shall collect all the customs duties accruing at the
                            several custom houses of the Dominican Republic until the payment or
                            retirement of any and all bonds issued by the Dominican Government in
                            accordance with the plan and under the limitations as to terms and
                            amounts hereinbefore recited” et cetera.</p>
                        <p>A gesture, as the one suggested, on your part, Mr. President, would be
                            received by the Dominican Government with unprecedented jubilation and
                            gratitude. Such [would] be an ample, generous and frank solution, taken
                            in the spirit in which you wish the relations between our peoples to be
                            conducted; and, furthermore, it would detract nothing from the rest of
                            the obligations contracted through the treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0592"/>
                        <p>Among these obligations, the study of which could be the subject of
                            further negotiations, there is one which prevents the Dominican
                            Government from revising its tariff. You can imagine what such a clause,
                            in force for over a third of a century, must have meant to my country.
                            In times of violent economic and political upheaval, both internal and
                            international, in which all the nations of the world have had to revise
                            their standards of production and interchange, together with their
                            revenue systems, one of the mainsprings of which is the customs, the
                            Dominican Republic has been prevented from taking any steps in this
                            direction because of that treaty clause.</p>
                        <p>This clause has acted as a fetter to government action when this action
                            was most needed to consolidate the process of political and economic
                            restoration from which my country is now successfully emerging.</p>
                        <p>Please be good enough, Mr. President, to forgive me for bringing this
                            matter to your attention while you are so busily engaged with other
                            problems. I have been encouraged to do it because of the kindness and
                            friendship with which you honored me and because of the affectionate
                            interest with which you have invariably faced all questions concerning
                            Latin America.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Norweb called me from New York this morning at about 10:30 to say
                            that he had just returned from seeing off General Trujillo on the <hi rend="italic">Normandie</hi>, where he was occupying the Deauville
                            suite, the most luxurious accommodations on the vessel.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Norweb said that he had had an opportunity to discuss at some length
                            with General Trujillo the question of the revision of the Convention of
                            1924. General Trujillo stated that while the Dominican Government was
                            very anxious to establish a Dominican national bank on the basis of a
                            purchase of the Dominican branches of the National City Bank of New
                            York, it did not wish to surrender financial control of this proposed
                            national bank to a board of directors with predominantly American
                            membership. Apparently, however, he was quite willing to have the bank
                            collect the customs and to have that part of the organization of the
                            bank which did collect the customs under American control. General
                            Trujillo stated that he was much gratified at the cordiality of the
                            reception accorded him in the United States, and referred in
                            particularly warm terms to the Secretary of State.</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>He told Mr. Norweb that he and Sr. Pastoriza had had an opportunity at
                            the reception at the Dominican Legation on July 27 to discuss the
                            proposed convention with the Secretary, and that the latter had stated
                            that upon his return from his vacation he would be prepared personally
                            to give consideration to the matter. General Trujillo added that in a
                            subsequent conversation between the Dominican Minister and the Secretary
                            of State the following day, the Secretary had confirmed to Sr. Pastoriza
                            his intention of giving personal consideration to the proposed
                            convention upon his return from vacation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Norweb stated that the General and Sr. Pastoriza appeared to lay
                            particular stress on these statements attributed to the Secretary, and
                            that the General had instructed Sr. Pastoriza to forego his leave at the
                            present time and to await instructions from President Peynado from the
                            Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>General Trujillo informed Mr. Norweb that he had been advised by his
                            counselors in the Dominican Republic to avoid taking the lead personally
                            in the negotiations and to have them conducted through regular channels
                            by reference to the present Dominican Government, subject of course to
                            the General’s approval. The General stated that he was returning to the
                            United States sometime in October on his way back to the Dominican
                            Republic and hoped that negotiations would have reached a point of
                            agreement by that time. He told Mr. Norweb that he believed that there
                            was still room for negotiation upon the basis of the existing drafts,
                            but that in case this was not possible, the Dominican Government would
                            submit through Pastoriza an entirely new proposal based upon the
                            considerations which he, General Trujillo, and Sr. Pastoriza had
                            outlined informally to Mr. Duggan on the occasion of their call at the
                            Department of State earlier in July.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear General Trujillo</hi>: In acknowledging
                                the receipt of your letter of July 26, 1939, I desire to say that
                                the officials of this Government have been only too glad to extend
                                to you friendly courtesies. I am pleased that you found your stay in
                                this country enjoyable.</p>
                            <p>Your reiteration that the foreign policy of the people and Government
                                of the Dominican Republic is pledged to the aims of continental
                                solidarity cannot but evoke a feeling of gratification on the part
                                of this Government.</p>
                            <p>I sincerely appreciate your frankness in making your suggestion with
                                respect to the existing Convention of 1924 between the Dominican
                                Republic and the United States and wish to assure you that for my
                                own part personally, I welcome them in the spirit in which I know
                                they have been made. I feel sure that you realize that this
                                Government no less than that of the Dominican Republic has been
                                desirous of finding a solution which would, while honoring the
                                contractual obligations of both Governments towards third parties,
                                clear away the remaining vestiges of the former special financial
                                relationship between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>While the method that you suggest, namely, that the President of the
                                United States either appoint a Dominican citizen as Receiver General
                                of Dominican Customs or else leave that post unfilled, has much to
                                recommend it on the grounds of simplicity, such a solution could
                                only be partial in its effects.</p>
                            <p>Under the Convention of 1924, and in the contracts of the Dominican
                                external bonds, the two Governments assumed certain responsibilities
                                toward the purchasers and owners of these bonds. Merely to appoint a
                                Dominican citizen as Receiver General of Dominican Customs, even
                                were that gesture satisfactory to the Dominican people and
                                Government, would not in effect transfer any of the responsibility
                                of the Government of the United States to the Dominican Government,
                                which has been one of the chief objectives of both Governments.
                                Furthermore, it is my understanding that there are several other
                                provisions of the Convention, including that mentioned by you with
                                regard to alterations in the Dominican Customs Tariff, which stand
                                in need of revision.</p>
                            <p>It was with the view to effecting a complete revision of the
                                provisions of the Convention of 1924 in an effort to respond to the
                                aspirations of the Dominican Government and people while
                                safeguarding the obligations assumed towards the holders of
                                Dominican external bonds, that the Government of the United States
                                first agreed to undertake <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0595"/>negotiations for a new instrument which might be substituted for
                                that Convention.</p>
                            <p>It was my hope that these informal negotiations, which had proceeded
                                to what was believed to be the point of mutual agreement, might be
                                brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I need hardly bring to your attention the fact that while
                                the Executive Branch of this Government is charged with the
                                responsibility of negotiating treaties and conventions, under our
                                Constitution it must submit these instruments to the Senate for its
                                advice and consent.</p>
                            <p>In closing may I take the opportunity again to assure you that this
                                Government is sincerely desirous of concluding an agreement to
                                replace the Convention of 1924 which will respond to Dominican
                                aspirations and will dissolve the remaining direct financial
                                relationship between the two Governments without prejudice to the
                                interests of third parties. To this end this Government is prepared
                                either to continue with a discussion of existing proposals or to
                                examine with sympathetic understanding any new proposal which may be
                                proffered by the Dominican Government.</p>
                            <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report to the
                            Department that the President of the Dominican Republic, Dr. Peynado,
                            and the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Despradel, have separately informed me
                            that so far as their Government is concerned negotiations looking toward
                            a revision of the American-Dominican Convention of 1924 have been
                            suspended.</p>
                        <p>Both President Peynado and the Foreign Secretary agreed in saying that it
                            was possible that conversations might be resumed upon the return through
                            Washington of General Trujillo as they understood that the General and
                            Mr. Pastoriza had talked on the subject with Secretary Hull late in
                            July. However, the nature of such renewed conversations, if they were
                            resumed, would depend entirely upon General Trujillo’s views and what
                            Mr. Pastoriza could tell him as to the possibilities in Washington.
                            President Peynado and the Foreign Secretary professed complete ignorance
                            as to the nature of the conversation between Secretary Hull, General
                            Trujillo and Mr. Pastoriza.</p>
                        <p>It is clear to me that no one in the Dominican Republic will touch the
                            Convention question pending the return of General Trujillo.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the trust that renewed study of the
                            plan to replace the Receiver General of Dominican Customs by a fiscal
                            agent representing the bondholders might afford a basis for revision of
                            the 1924 Convention, I have the honor to submit the following
                            observations, together with a sketch of such a proposed arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The history of the negotiations between the American and Dominican
                            Governments since 1937, seeking revision of the 1924 Convention, makes
                            it abundantly clear that the two sides to the conversations have been
                            attempting to achieve two mutually conflicting objects: the maintenance
                            of foreign control of Dominican customs collection for the protection of
                            holders of Dominican bonds while at the same time preserving the fiction
                            of Dominican sovereignty over the customs service.</p>
                        <p>The time has come for a restatement of objectives. … The United States
                            Government in line with its present Latin American policy is willing to
                            give up its present position vis-à-vis the Dominican Government as a
                            tutelary state: to drop out of the picture in so far as collection of
                            the Dominican customs revenues is concerned. It cannot, however, because
                            of the fact that in 1907<note n="8" xml:id="d561fn8">See convention
                                signed February 8, 1907, <ref target="frus1907p1#pg_307">
                           <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1907, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 307</ref>.</note> and 1924 it
                            pledged its moral credit to the holders of Dominican bonds, admit that
                            the collection of the custom revenues pledged to the repayment of those
                            bonds revert wholly to Dominican hands, in view of the lamentable record
                            of the past with respect to Dominican finances. It is willing, however,
                            by means of a new agreement between the two governments to perfect an
                            arrangement by which the bondholders themselves and the Dominican
                            Government mutually arrange for the collection of customs to be applied
                            to the Dominican foreign debt.</p>
                        <p>Once these premises have been understood and accepted by the Dominicans
                            the framework of a possible new arrangement could be discussed. As
                            pointed out above it would be in essence an agreement between the
                            Dominican Government and the bondholders themselves confirmed, however,
                            by a new Convention between the American and Dominican Governments thus
                            placing the seal of both states upon an instrument doing away with the
                            now anachronistic Convention of 1924.</p>
                        <p>The collection of Dominican customs would be arranged by a voluntary
                            delegation of power by the Dominican Republic to its creditors <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0597"/>and not to a foreign state as
                            under the existing Convention. Technically this would not be an
                            impairment of sovereignty as the personnel of the customs service would
                            be appointed by the Dominican Executive even though they were selected
                            by the bondholders or their representative, the Fiscal Agent. This in
                            itself is a considerable advance over the juridical position of the
                            Dominican Republic at the present time as a state bound by the 1924
                            Convention to the American Government. Actually, however—and the
                            Dominicans should not blink the fact—real control of the customs
                            collection would be in the hands of the bondholders through their
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>The draft of the proposed Convention set forth below would, therefore,
                            contain a considerable amount of sugar-coating and to this country of
                            lawyers should be more acceptable from a legal point of view,
                            particularly with reference to sovereignty. Even though no pretense
                            would be made that the Dominican Government was to have entire control
                            of its customs collection for the application of the revenues therefrom
                            to the payment of the foreign debt, the Dominican Government could
                            truthfully say that it had appointed the Fiscal Agent and other
                            officials charged with such collection and that therefore the customs
                            service was essentially a Dominican organism. The provision in the draft
                            below that the customs service should be staffed by Dominican citizens
                            with the possible exception of the Fiscal Agent and the two assistants
                            he is empowered to nominate, would not change materially the present set
                            up in the Receivership but would satisfy national aspirations in this
                            regard. Furthermore there is nothing in the draft Convention to prevent
                            the appointment of Dominicans to any or all of these three essential
                            posts were they to be nominated by the bondholders or the Fiscal
                            Agent.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the present draft does not include any phraseology to
                            prevent a stalemate between the nominating power of the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council (this might likewise read the Committee
                            of Dominican Bondholders) and the appointive power of the Dominican
                            President, since this might be more tactfully handled by an exchange of
                            notes in which the two Governments would agree that the President of the
                            Dominican Republic would at once appoint the Fiscal Agent nominated by
                            the bondholders and that he would further at once appoint the personnel
                            of the customs service selected by the Fiscal Agent.</p>
                        <p>The new draft eliminates two factors of the 1924 Convention which have
                            been onerous to the Dominican Government. The first of these is Article
                            III of the 1924 agreement which gave the United States veto power over
                            the right of the Dominican Government to increase the public debt.
                            Retained, however, is the proviso included in previous drafts of the
                            “Bank Plan” Convention which prevents the Dominican Government from
                            pledging the remainder of the amalgamated customs <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0598"/>revenues not applied to the interest
                            and amortization of the present foreign debt as the basis for any new
                            financial obligation.</p>
                        <p>Another objectionable feature from the Dominican point of view to the
                            1924 Convention has been the practical freezing of the customs tariff in
                            effect when the 1924 Convention was ratified without ease of
                            modification. The draft Convention<note n="9" xml:id="d561fn9">Not
                                printed.</note> appended to this memorandum, in interjecting the
                            idea of an amalgamation of the old customs tariff and the present duties
                            on imports levied in the guise of so-called internal revenue taxes,
                            gives the Dominican Republic a welcome opportunity for a scientific
                            revision of its present antiquated tariff structure. This revision
                            would, it is logical to expect, result in improved revenues for the
                            Government as compared with the present tariff schedules. It would also
                            serve, provided the study be made by expert economists, to increase
                            commerce in the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, it would be possible
                            under the proposed draft Convention for this new amalgamated customs
                            tariff to be revised from time to time as the needs of the Dominican
                            Republic gave warrant, provided always, of course, that such revision
                            would not so diminish the customs revenues as to impair the services of
                            amortization and interest on the foreign debt.</p>
                        <p>Under the draft Convention appended herewith there would be no need for
                            any reference to the bank plan. It is an open question if the Dominican
                            Republic is particularly enthusiastic for a national bank. … There is an
                            unlimited field of potential legislation open to the Dominican
                            Government which would in effect create a monopoly for the national bank
                            of all commercial financial transactions. … Should a Dominican National
                            Bank be created under the auspices of the American Government and prove
                            a failure it would be difficult for the United States to escape
                            censure.</p>
                        <p>However, as between the two governments it appears that the Department of
                            State is not directly concerned with whether the Dominican Republic
                            acquires a national bank or not. Our sole objective is to remove the
                            United States Government from its present position of fiscal guardian to
                            the Dominican Republic and to replace the American Government by a
                            representative of the bondholders for the protection of their equity as
                            represented by the Dominican foreign debt. The establishment of a
                            national bank has no particular effect upon the attainment of these
                            objectives. The question should more properly be one for private
                            negotiation between the Dominican Government and the American bank now
                            apparently eager to dispose of its business in the Dominican Republic.
                            It would appear that the fundamental policy of the Department may become
                            beclouded by connecting a new political arrangement between the two
                            governments with a private contract of sale between a bank and the
                            Dominican Government; and <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0599"/>that
                            the success of our own negotiations may be impaired because of their
                            linking with private negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Also to be considered as an essential concomitant to the proposed draft
                            Convention would be an exchange of notes providing for an orderly
                            liquidation of the Dominican floating debt and an exchange of notes
                            establishing a Receivership pension plan. If the Dominican Government
                            is, as it will claim in the negotiations, a solvent organization whose
                            credit is sound and whose finances are in order there is no reason on
                            earth why its long outstanding floating debt obligations, most of which
                            are small in amount and owned by persons fully as necessitous of money
                            as the Dominican Government, should not be paid. As for the pension plan
                            it is a sound system which has received Government approval and to which
                            no objection can be offered.</p>
                        <p>In the final analysis there are only two points upon which agreement must
                            be reached. One of these points is already accepted by both
                            governments—that the United States shall cease to collect Dominican
                            customs for the benefit of the bondholders of the Dominican Republic.
                            The other point has not been accepted but it seems reasonable and might
                            eventually form the basis of agreement—that the bondholders be assured
                            their money will be repaid to them by supervising the collection of the
                            revenues pledged to their debt, through an official of their own
                            choosing, whose authority over the customs service shall be adequate,
                            but who shall act for the Dominican Government as well as for the
                            bondholders.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Upon leaving on my
                            homeward trip, I wish to express once more my appreciation for all the
                            courtesies which were shown me during my visit in the United States. At
                            the same time, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August
                                4,<note n="10" xml:id="d562fn10">See draft of reply to communication
                                from the Chief of Staff of the Dominican Army, <ref target="#pg_586">p. 586</ref>.</note> in reply to mine of July 26 and which
                            reached me in Paris when, in the midst of the alarms of pre-war days, I
                            was preparing the return trip of my family to America.</p>
                        <p>I was happy to know that you also feel that, due to its simplicity, the
                            idea of taking definite steps towards the solution of the problem which
                            divides our two countries by appointing a Dominican citizen <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0600"/>for the post of General Receiver of
                            Customs or by leaving the post vacant, is highly commendable. As you so
                            justly realize, this method, partial in its results, would have the
                            advantage of breaking through eight years of Chancery negotiations in
                            search of a complete solution, and, in my opinion, it would be the basis
                            for a rapid understanding of the general convention which, as you well
                            advise, must replace that of 1924.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime I have been advised that the post of General Receiver of
                            Customs is now vacant<note n="11" xml:id="d562fn11">William E. Pulliam
                                had resigned from this post, which he had filled since 1921, on
                                August 1, 1938.</note> and that new proposals for a convention
                            between our two countries are being considered. Under these
                            circumstances, a negotiation undertaken under your personal auspices,
                            Mr. President, could not fail to reach the solution that our two
                            governments desire.</p>
                        <p>Welcoming the cordial invitation expressed in your above mentioned letter
                            of August 4, stating that the Government of the United States “will
                            examine with benevolent understanding any new proposal submitted by the
                            Dominican Government”, this Government intends to submit to the
                            consideration of the State Department a new basis for discussions which
                            contains in substance the essential points upon which that Department
                            has been insisting and which eliminates, at least partially, the
                            dispositions of the Convention of 1924 which my country considers as
                            offensive to its sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>The Dominican proposal, taking into consideration the interest of third
                            parties which you mention in your letter, would strengthen the guaranty
                            of the external debt binding to its service the total amount of the
                            Government’s income, which amounts to 11 million dollars, instead of
                            making one sole collection of customs which amounts to more or less
                            $2,800,000, representing the guaranty in accordance with the present
                            Convention.</p>
                        <p>The Dominican proposal, in its general outline, can be expressed as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>I.</label>
                                <item>—The Government of the United States and the Government of the
                                    Dominican Republic agree to abrogate the Convention of December
                                    27, 1924.</item>
                                <label>II.</label>
                                <item>—The Government of the United States and the Government of the
                                    Dominican Republic appoint, by mutual agreement, the National
                                    City Bank of New York as depositor of the general funds of the
                                    Dominican Government and agree to it that an official of that
                                    Bank will act therein in the capacity of representative of the
                                    Fiscal Agent of the loans. This official will receive by
                                    indorsement on the first days of each month, the amount
                                    representing the payment of the amortization and interests of
                                    the loans of 1922 and of 1926, by means of instructions for
                                    payment which will be given to the bank by the Dominican
                                    Government or through the Treasury Department.</item>

                                <item>—The Government of the Dominican Republic agrees not to
                                    dispose of the funds deposited in the bank until the amount
                                    corresponding to the amortization and interests of the external
                                    debt has been segregated and paid in total.</item>
                                <label>IV.</label>
                                <item>—It is understood that the amortization of the external bonds
                                    of 1922 and of 1926 will be made in accordance with the
                                    agreement reached with the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                                    Council, Inc. on August 16, 1934.</item>
                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>A Convention based on these points would give back to my country the
                            right to manage their own Customs and revise their tariffs, thus opening
                            the door to sure prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Being well acquainted, Mr. President, with your interest in the solution
                            of this problem, I have taken the liberty of calling once more your
                            attention to our points of view on the matter.</p>
                        <p>In taking leave of you, Mr. President, I wish to reiterate the assurances
                            of my appreciation for your courtesies and of my highest esteem and
                            consideration.</p>

                            inform Your Excellency that the Dominican Government, in fulfillment of
                            the promise made by Generalissimo Doctor Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina
                            to His Excellency, President Roosevelt, in the letter which he addressed
                            to him on October 25, 1939, in response to a letter dated August 4th of
                            the same year, which the former received during his stay in Paris from
                            the first mandatary of the United States, is willing to offer to the
                            Government of the United States, as bases for a satisfactory
                            modification of the Dominican-American Convention of 1924, all
                            guaranties necessary to arrive at the conclusion of a new instrument
                            which shall replace, to the mutual advantage, the one which is today
                            existing between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>Generalissimo Doctor Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, in the
                            aforementioned communication, expressed to His Excellency, President
                            Roosevelt, that the new bases of discussion which the Dominican
                            Government proposed to submit to the Department of State for
                            consideration, would comprise the essential points which the Department
                            of State has emphasized, and would eliminate, at least in part, the
                            provisions of the Convention of 1924, which the Dominican Republic has
                            considered prejudicial to her sovereignty. The plan which, in accordance
                            with that promise, the Dominican Republic hereby submits to the United
                            States Government for consideration, tends substantially <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0602"/>to strengthen the guaranty which the
                            Convention in force assures to the Bondholders, since it pledges to the

                            more than twelve million dollars per annum. The security stipulated by
                            the Convention in force, on the contrary, amounts to only two million
                            six hundred dollars approximately, which sum is considerably lower than
                            that mentioned in this new plan which obviously constitutes proof of our
                            sincere desire to conciliate the points of view of the two Governments
                            and to facilitate between them an agreement designed to eliminate the
                            only problem of an international nature which remains between our two
                            nations.</p>

                            friendly interest, the efforts which our two Governments are making in
                            order to solve this problem, no doubt will, in this instance, bring
                            about the result which both parties desire and which they have pursued
                            up to this time without having been able to find a satisfactory

                            primarily of a moral nature and corresponds above all to our legitimate

                            prejudiced by the Dominican-American Convention of 1924 and to give this
                            international instrument, at the same time, a meaning and direction,
                            compatible with the profound and sincere friendship which today exists

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: Dr. Aurelio Mosquera Narvaez,
                            the President of Ecuador, invited me to the Presidential Palace this
                            morning and received me with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>The President briefly referred to the efforts of his administration in
                            taking steps which would improve the handling of public affairs, adding
                            that he thought some of the worst influences had been eliminated and
                            hoped now to be able to make substantial strides forward. In addition he
                            stressed the fact that the Banco Central, Ecuador’s Bank of Issue, was
                            being re-officered and a new Board of Directors would soon be installed
                            from whom it was reasonable to expect a proper administration of the
                            bank’s finances which eventually would [be] reflected in its improved
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The President added that he had been impressed with the policy of
                            Washington in seeking some practical manner in which to aid the
                            countries that worked with it: that Ecuador had seen with approval the
                            aid extended in the case of Brazil<note n="1" xml:id="d564fn1">See <ref target="#pg_348">pp. 348</ref> ff.</note> and that Ecuador would
                            like to do several constructive things, but before being able to do them
                            would need a loan of possibly as much as ten million dollars. He asked
                            if I would confidentially convey this suggestion to the Department and
                            then let him know how the Department was impressed with the intimation
                            he had made.</p>
                        <p>I told him I would be pleased to send an airmail letter today which
                            should reach Washington next Monday morning conveying his message, but
                            that there were several ways of approaching such a matter. One would be
                            for the Government to make a financial statement outlining such plans as
                            it might have under contemplation, another would be to invite a
                            Financial Counselor to come down, look over the field and prepare a
                            statement; but I hesitated to suggest the latter method because it was
                            my impression that on a previous occasion when a financial <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0605"/>adviser had been here some
                            disagreements had arisen at a time when Mr. Boniface<note n="2" xml:id="d564fn2">Neptali Bonifaz, chairman of the Board of Directors
                                of the Central Bank of Ecuador.</note> was then as now an important
                            figure in the banking world.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister, Doctor Julio Tobar Donoso, broke in and said he
                            knew of the matter to which I referred, but that the incident had its
                            explanations for the adviser who was furnished by the Kemmerer
                                Commission<note n="3" xml:id="d564fn3">American Commission of
                                Financial Advisers headed by Edwin W. Kemmerer, Princeton University
                                professor, 1926–27.</note> was by some regarded as theoretical. At
                            least it was a case where the two men did not get along.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was sure that if the Department favored the idea
                            some practical method of working out the details could be found.</p>
                        <p>I regretted that we had no phone to Washington as it would be easier to
                            talk the matter over with you, but promised that I would write today
                            without fail.</p>
                        <p>While I realize that insufficient information is hereby furnished with
                            regard to the use of the proposed loan and while also aware that
                            Ecuador’s record with respect to bonds has been somewhat unsatisfactory
                            in the past, I would appreciate hearing whether there is any possibility
                            of this matter receiving serious consideration should more exact data be
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>The individuals in the present Government are a high class lot of
                            Ecuadoreans, filled, I believe, with the best of intentions and it seems
                            now that they are pretty well set in the saddle; yet judging from the
                            past they might be succeeded by a less capable group.</p>

                        <p>21. In connection with my letter of March 31 to Mr. Welles regarding
                            Ecuador’s desire for loan I wish to add that the present administration
                            seems friendly to our Government and is stronger now than it was a few
                            weeks ago before the strike of university students reported in my
                            despatch No. 396, March 20, 1939.<note n="4" xml:id="d565fn4">Not

                            approximately 1 year.<note n="6" xml:id="d566fn6">This assignment was in
                                response to a request from the Ecuadoran Government for the services

                                plans for highway development.</note> Please inform the Ecuadoran

                            Quito and return, an allowance in Ecuador at the rate of 150 dollars per
                            month, and his expenses in traveling within Ecuador. (For your

                  </p>
                        <p>Because of the geographical position and topography of its lands, the
                            Republic of Ecuador offers great potentiality for the economic
                            production of every kind of agricultural produce and livestock which up
                            to now has not been developed nor increased due to lack of roads joining
                            productive zones with the shipping ports. The result is that production
                            has been limited to fill in the requirements of local markets and this
                            restriction means that the country has but poorly taken advantage of its
                            agricultural wealth without it being able to reach full rendering
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>Ecuador’s mineral wealth is apparent but the number of exploiting
                            enterprises working its deposits at present are almost insignificant.
                            Consequently, a net of roads giving access to mining zones and which
                            would connect, safely and economically with sea ports, is indispensable
                            for developing this inexhaustible source towards individual and public
                            prosperity.</p>
                        <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0607"/>
                        <p>Ecuador disposes of vast and extremely fertile lands situated but at a
                            short distance from the chief interior markets and export centers, lands
                            which enjoy healthy climates and suitable for the welcome of thousands
                            of colonists who, without having to bring with them large capital, would
                            soon reach economic independence.</p>
                        <p>Up to now Ecuador has not stood out as a country which offers great
                            tourist attraction. Its natural beauty and treasures of art as exhibited
                            by her ancient monuments are hardly known. Slow means of traveling has
                            resulted in that Ecuador, much to its economic prejudice, finds itself
                            shut out from the great tourist streams of the world.</p>
                        <p>The country has tried to live and progress almost by itself and its
                            development has therefore been slow. A working plan to include the
                            elementary requirements of modern commercial intensive living has never
                            been able to be put into practice. It is felt that the moment has
                            arrived when, leaving this conservative policy aside, active development
                            of a programme which includes the scientific exploitation of its natural
                            wealth, can be begun. This would necessarily involve disbursing a large
                            capital and as it is unobtainable within the country, it will have to be
                            obtained from abroad.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Ecuador began by acknowledging that it is from every
                            point of view essential to come to an arrangement respecting the
                            payment, in cash, of the external debt as represented by the Bonds of
                            the Guayaquil &amp; Quito Railway,<note n="8" xml:id="d567fn8">See <ref target="frus1936v05#pg_536">

                            firmly resolved to arrive at a solution which shall equitably consider
                            mutual rights and interests both of the country and its creditors.
                            Nobody has a greater interest than the Government to have its credit
                            unencumbered as soon as ever possible, because it is fully alive to the
                            fact that it is the only way open towards its national economic
                            reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of reaching an agreement with the Bondholders, whereby
                            they would take over the technical management of the Guayaquil and Quito
                            Railway and the Quito Ibarra Railway, for a certain number of years,
                            might also be considered, the Government guaranteeing tariffs which,
                            after carefully studying their relation with the various interests
                            concerned, can render a sufficient margin to cover interest and
                            amortization services on the final amount agreed through negotiation, an
                            arrangement which might be based more or less on the following
                            conditions: <list>

                                <item>If the Bondholders were to esteem it convenient, they would
                                    modernize the services of both railways and place them in a
                                    condition to render greater revenues;</item>

                                <item>The Bondholders would have to agree as to the necessity of
                                    reducing the amount of capital owing in harmony with the net
                                    revenue of both railways which would be the only one applicable
                                    to the interest <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0608"/>and
                                    amortization of the capital that would represent the new and
                                    final amount of the debt;</item>
                                <label>

                                <item>The Bondholders might furnish the capital necessary to
                                    complete the Railway from Ibarra to San Lorenzo or to any other
                                    port of the Pacific.</item>
                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>The general idea is that the present development of the country’s
                            business makes it indispensable that a corporation will direct and
                            finance in a thoroughly efficient manner both railways as to place them
                            in a state of paying for the operating, maintenance and depreciation
                            requirements as well as cover interest and amortization of the debt and
                            of the new capital to be furnished by the Bondholders over a prudential
                            number of years. It is thus that the Government would relieve itself of
                            the payment of the debt and the Bondholders would become sufficiently
                            covered. In the event that the railways exploitation revenues showed an
                            excess after meeting interest and amortization services, the Government
                            would have a right to 50% of such excess.</p>
                        <p>Running parallel to aforementioned, and as an essential complement,
                            efforts should also be made concerning the obtaining of a loan of
                            sixteen million, five hundred thousand dollars.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Ecuador would distribute the proceeds of the Loan as

                            <p>Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Feis</hi>: The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                of Ecuador and his colleague came to see me this afternoon and asked
                                whether I had as yet received a copy of Mr. Fetter’s report and also
                                whether any decision had been reached with regard to the memorandum
                                left with me by the Ambassador of Ecuador a short time before we
                                sailed and of <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0610"/>which the
                                Minister handed me a copy which is attached herewith. I replied in
                                the negative to both inquiries.</p>
                            <p>We had a fairly ample discussion during the course of which I limited
                                myself to the reiteration of the principles contained in my speech
                                of yesterday<note n="12" xml:id="d568fn12">

                                submitted were receiving the most careful study in Washington and
                                that I could state with certainty that the most favorable possible
                                consideration would be given when a proposal was advanced by Ecuador
                                which would provide for productive development in Ecuador and which
                                would be regarded as financially justifiable by the appropriate
                                governmental institutions in Washington.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he would give me
                                additional detailed projects before he left, and we also discussed
                                the need of Ecuador’s undertaking with as little delay as possible a
                                comprehensive plan for the situation of non-competitive agricultural
                                production in Ecuador. I may say that both the Minister and his
                                associate, Dr. Icaza, appeared not only to understand the
                                desirability of this from the standpoint of public opinion in the
                                United States, but to be genuinely interested in it <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> because of the promise it held for the
                                creation of additional commerce in the United States. I told him
                                that immediately upon my return to Washington I would urge our
                                Secretary of Agriculture to select a competent expert to go to
                                Ecuador to study the situation and recommend to the Government of
                                Ecuador a suitable plan of complementary agricultural
                                    production.<note n="13" xml:id="d568fn13">In instruction No.
                                    171, October 18, the Minister in Ecuador was informed that
                                    Atherton Lee and Charles L. Luedtke had been detailed by the
                                    President to assist the Ecuadoran Government for a period of
                                    about 1 month in the study of problems relating to the
                                    production and development of tropical products. Mr. Luedtke had
                                    made a previous agricultural survey on Ecuador in February–March

                        <p>1. On September 26, 1939, the Delegation consisting of the Minister of
                            Foreign Relations of Ecuador, and Doctor Antonio Quevedo, Minister of
                            Ecuador in Peru, called upon the Representative of the <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0611"/>Secretary of State of the United States
                            of America at the Consultative Meeting in Panamá.</p>
                        <p>2. In accordance with the conversation during that visit, the Ecuadoran
                            Delegation has the honor to state the following:</p>
                        <p rend="center">A) <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract for the Construction of
                                Public Works in Ecuador</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>3. The Delegation would greatly appreciate the provision of the required
                            assistance by the Department of State for the favorable conclusion of
                            the negotiations initiated with a view to having one or more United
                            States companies contract for the construction, completion and
                            improvement of the highways, railways and port works specified in the
                            memorandum that Tobar Donoso gave to Mr. Welles during the conversation
                            mentioned.</p>
                        <p>4. With the mentioned memorandum—another copy of which was delivered some
                            months before in Washington by Señor Colón Eloy Alfaro<note n="14" xml:id="d569fn14">See memorandum handed by the Ecuadoran Ambassador

                            Provinces of Ecuador with indications of the railways and highways the
                            construction or improvement of which is desired by the Government of
                            Quito. There are not provided in the mentioned memorandum all the
                            details relating to agricultural, livestock and industrial development,
                            but the data relative to such development will be provided
                            subsequently.</p>
                        <p>5. The Government of Ecuador does not have available sufficient funds to
                            cover the total expenses required for the construction of these public
                            works, so that the company that makes the contracts, with the benevolent
                            cooperation of the Government of the United States and of the
                            Export-Import Bank, would necessarily advance the capital required which
                            would be refunded subsequently, in the manner and form that shall be
                            agreed upon. The Government of Ecuador does not desire to receive the
                            funds for the works, but the works themselves, so that the funds would
                            be handled by the entity that undertakes the works, without prejudice to
                            the right of the Government of Ecuador to admit the expenditures and to
                            pass upon the technical specifications of the works.</p>

                            Welles’ speech and referred to that in which he said that for “the
                            purchase of railway material, machinery, heavy materials, etc., there
                            would be required longer term credits”. The Delegation indicated that,
                            in addition to the works specified in the memorandum delivered to Mr.
                            Welles on September 26, there should be constructed or improved certain

                            Mr. Welles lend cooperation in the steps necessary to attain this
                            objective.</p>

                        <p>7. The Delegation expressed appreciation for the declaration made by Mr.
                            Welles that “the Government of the United States desires to cooperate
                            with the other American Governments in the efforts that each one of them
                            may make for development of the resources of its country in accordance
                            with sound economic standards and in noncompetitive fields”; and his
                            statement that “when it may be desired, they would be assisted in
                            negotiating for credits, either through the system of private banks, or
                            through the official agencies of the Government when the latter have at
                            their disposal funds for such purposes”.</p>
                        <p>8. In respect to this declaration the Delegation indicated that the
                            Government of Ecuador desires to develop the resources of its country,
                            the economic situation of which is being affected by the European war
                            which has closed markets of exportation, rendered difficult the
                            importation into Ecuador of various products, and disorganized the
                            system of transportation that serves the commerce of the country, all of
                            which may produce consequences affecting the stability of Ecuadoran

                            set forth in Annex No. 2. Annexes Nos. 3, 4 and 5, indicate in detail
                            the exports of each Ecuadoran article (including the total value,
                            without any deduction, of the exports of gold and petroleum) in the
                            years 1936, 1937 and 1938, respectively. Annex No. 6 summarizes
                            Ecuadoran exports to principal countries and shows that the annual
                            percentages of exports to Germany, which are now paralyzed, varied
                            approximately between 20 and 27 percent of our total exports. France has
                            absorbed from 8 to 12 percent of our exports and Great Britain another
                            percentage; both countries have begun to reduce their importation of the
                            articles they bought in Ecuador. As a result, it may be deduced that the
                            European war has closed markets that consumed from 30 to 40 percent of
                            Ecuadoran exports.</p>

                        <p>11. Annexes 9 to 16 set forth in detail the manner in which international
                            transportation from and to Ecuador, by air and water, was effected in
                            the years 1931 to 1938. From these tables it appears that German ships
                            have transported more cargo than those of any other flag.</p>
                        <p>12. As a consequence of this situation it is going to be indispensable to
                            Ecuador to obtain new markets for its products, and to do everything
                            possible so that other navigation lines may transport the cargo that was
                            formerly carried by the Germans.</p>

                            experts who may determine which resources of both types may be developed

                            but it was necessary to decrease in Chapter III of the Annex the total
                            value in the instances of gold and petroleum as mentioned in No. 11 (<hi rend="italic">9?</hi>), letter (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of this

                            Chapter V of the same Annex which are articles reexported to the United

                            Such balance from January 1, 1936 to March 31, 1939 shows an unfavorable

                            Ecuadoran Government has, as in the case of the previous import control
                            regulations during the period following the effective date of the trade
                            agreement, disregarded the provisions of that agreement in connection
                            with restrictions upon imports from the United States. The Department
                            believes it desirable for two reasons to bring formally to the attention
                            of the Ecuadoran Government the applicability of the terms of the trade
                            agreement in connection with restrictions upon such imports: (1) to
                            impress upon that Government the importance which this Government
                            attaches to the full observation of the provisions of the agreement in
                            order that its integrity may not be impaired and (2) to secure for
                            articles of United States origin the protection provided by the terms of
                            the agreement. There is accordingly enclosed a note which, if you
                            perceive no objection, you are requested to hand to the Ecuadoran
                            Foreign Minister as soon as a suitable opportunity presents itself.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this note, you should point out to the Minister that your
                            Government is fully aware of the difficult economic situation which
                            Ecuador is facing, and has no desire to make that situation more
                            difficult by requiring an unreasonably strict interpretation of the
                            letter of those provisions of the trade agreement concerning the
                            imposition of import control measures. At the same time, your Government
                            regards it as of great importance that the clear terms of the agreement
                            be observed and that articles of United States origin receive the
                            treatment to which they are entitled under the terms of the agreement
                            during periods in which there is control of imports in Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>If, following a study of the enclosed note, the Foreign Minister or other
                            Ecuadoran officials should request information or suggestions as to the
                            manner in which the import control system and the provisions of the
                            trade agreement may be reconciled insofar as concerns the importation
                                <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0616"/>of articles from the United
                            States included in Schedule I, you may point out to them that either
                            Government, under the terms of the second paragraph of article VII of
                            the agreement, may for any of the reasons stated therein, including
                            protection of the currency, impose restrictions upon the importation of
                            schedule products from the other country, provided the procedure
                            outlined in that paragraph for notice and consultation is followed and
                            the two Governments reach agreement concerning the proposed measures. In
                            this connection you may say that you are certain that your Government
                            would not be disposed to object to reasonable import control measures
                            deemed necessary by the Government of Ecuador for the purpose of
                            safeguarding the value of the currency in periods of exchange
                            stringency. You may add that you would be glad to transmit to your
                            Government any proposal which the Ecuadoran Government may wish to make
                            at this time with a view to regularizing the present situation within
                            the terms of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>For your own information, you will observe that the enclosed note raises
                            the question of specific action to reconcile the Ecuadoran import
                            control system and the provisions of the trade agreement only with
                            respect to articles imported from the United States included in Schedule
                            I of the agreement (article VII), and that a decision is reserved
                            regarding the applicability of the terms of article VIII. While the
                            Department believes that a strict interpretation of article VIII of the
                            agreement in the light of the present Ecuadoran control regulations
                            would show at least a technical contravention of that article, the
                            Department does not wish to press this question at the present time, at
                            least until the effect of the new system upon imports from the United
                            States has been demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>With reference to that portion of your despatch no. 307 of January 12 in
                            which you refer to alleged discrimination against American products in
                            the granting of import permits, you should investigate this thoroughly,
                            and if you find evidence of such discrimination under the present import
                            control system, take up the question immediately with the appropriate
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department promptly and fully informed of developments in
                            connection with the matters referred to above.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Reference is made to the
                                reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Ecuador
                                signed on August 6, 1938 and <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0617"/>effective October 23, 1938, and the applicability of certain
                                provisions thereof in connection with the regulations understood to
                                have been issued on January 6, 1939 by Your Excellency’s Government
                                for the control of imports.</p>
                            <p>It is my Government’s understanding that under the import control
                                regulations issued by the Government of Ecuador on January 6, 1939,
                                monthly quotas are to be assigned to individual importers on the
                                basis of their average importations during a previous period, and
                                that within the limits of their quotas, importers are free to make
                                purchases from any country of any products connected with the normal
                                operation of their particular lines of business. It is my
                                Government’s understanding also that the import control regulations
                                make no exception from the general rule in connection with the
                                importation of articles included in Schedule I of the trade
                                agreement. It would appear, therefore, that in drafting these new
                                regulations Your Excellency’s Government failed to take into
                                consideration the pertinent provisions of the trade agreement with
                                respect to articles included in that Schedule.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to bring to the attention of Your Excellency that, by
                                the terms of the first paragraph of Article VII of the agreement,
                                neither Government may impose any prohibition, import quota, import
                                license, or any other form of quantitative regulation on the
                                importation or sale of any article the growth, produce or
                                manufacture of the other country included in the appropriate
                                schedule annexed to the agreement. It may be noted that this
                                paragraph prohibits not only the imposition of quotas but even the
                                requirement that a permit be secured by an importer in connection
                                with the importation of such articles. Your Excellency’s attention
                                is likewise invited to the fact that, although the provisions of the
                                second paragraph of Article VII of the agreement permit restrictions
                                to be imposed upon imports of articles included in the schedules for
                                certain stated reasons, Your Excellency’s Government did not give
                                the notice and arrange for the consultation between the two
                                Governments required in such circumstances.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the question of the applicability of the provisions
                                of Article VIII of the trade agreement to the existing import
                                control regulations, my Government wishes to reserve comment at this
                                time.</p>

                            of Finance to the effect that, as soon as the Board of Directors of the

                            the Import Control Regulations and will take into account the complaints
                            presented by the countries with which Ecuador has concluded trade
                            agreements. The Foreign Minister declares that he feels sure that
                            careful consideration will be given to the modifications of the
                            Regulations which will be duly presented by the Ministry of Finance,
                            adding that the factors concerning the balances of payments and the
                            trade agreements signed, among them that with the United States, will be
                            first studied.</p>

                            shortly and that they would not delay in proceeding to revise the Import

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on April
                            13th the President of Ecuador informed me that as soon as possible after
                            the return of the Minister for Foreign Affairs from vacation, he hoped
                            we might have a conference regarding the Trade Agreement. I replied that
                            I should be pleased to meet them at their convenience.</p>
                        <p>On the 12th Dr. Alejandro Ponce Borja, recently made General Manager of
                            the Banco Central, advised me that at the instance of his Board of
                            Directors he wished to confer with me regarding methods for improving
                            trade relations between the two countries. Yesterday when he undertook
                            to deal with the subject, he limited his remarks to our protest dated
                            March 13, 1939, saying the Minister for Foreign Affairs had requested
                            him to exchange views with the Minister of Finance and the Directorate
                            of the Banco Central, to ascertain if all restrictions might not be
                            removed on items listed in Schedule I.</p>
                        <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0619"/>
                        <p>Dr. Ponce Borja said that the opinion of the persons consulted was that
                            to do so would render their whole Import Control System ineffectual:
                            that we knew there was a Control when we signed the Agreement and he
                            wondered if we might not go easy in insisting upon strict compliance for
                            a time at least, until a study could be made.</p>
                        <p>I informed Dr. Ponce Borja that before the Trade Agreement was signed
                            there was general talk about canceling all Import Control plans; that
                            although signed August 6, 1938, the Agreement did not become effective
                            until October 23rd; that when I returned toward the end of December 1938
                            the matter of withholding or restricting import permits had been
                            informally discussed with officials at Guayaquil, and later at Quito,
                            and that Don Ricardo Ortiz of the Foreign Office had proposed to the
                            Minister of Finance that the new Import Control Regulations then under
                            study should be declared inapplicable to the French and American
                            Commercial Agreements. To this the Minister seemed to offer no
                            particular objection, but when the public was informed of the
                            Regulations, no such provision was included.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                     <hi rend="italic">Compliance</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I continued that if compliance would, as he thought, ruin Ecuador’s
                            Import Control Regulations, and such control was still deemed to be
                            necessary, notwithstanding recent public sentiment to the contrary, then
                            we might follow the provisions of the Agreement for arranging some other
                            understanding. I added that we would immediately seek to tabulate the
                            imports over recent years on all items in Schedule I in order to
                            ascertain whether the opinion which had been given to him was correct
                            and that when the tabulation was finished the Consul would come up from
                            Guayaquil and we would go into the matter in an effort to ascertain what
                            indeed the effect would be upon the Import Control should our Trade
                            Agreement be followed literally.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Consulate General at
                            Guayaquil and as Mr. Nester has been informed for weeks that this

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your despatch no. 420
                            of April 5, 1939,<note n="24" xml:id="d574fn24">Not printed.</note>
                            enclosing a copy of an Ecuadoran law enacted March 3, 1939 dealing with
                            the determination of export values of crude petroleum, mineral earth and
                            gold bullion and specie and providing for the basing of quotas for
                            imports from individual countries upon the value of Ecuadoran exports to
                            such nations.</p>
                        <p>The possible effects of this law upon United States trade relations with
                            Ecuador and on the operation of the trade agreement, naturally are of
                            concern to the Department. There is enclosed a note which you are
                            requested to hand to the Foreign Minister at an early opportunity, which
                            sets forth this Government’s position on the broad question
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>While making it clear to the Minister that your Government cannot accept
                            the validity of the bilateral, country by country, trade balance theory
                            of the law under reference, you may wish to point out that even on the
                            basis of that questionable theory, the law is open to a number, of
                            objections. For example, the specified percentages of the export values
                            of mineral earth and crude petroleum which the law would permit to be
                            included for the purposes of calculating Ecuador’s balance of trade with
                            individual countries, would appear to be considerably less than the
                            actual proportion of the export value of those products which returns to
                            Ecuador. Regarding mineral earth, you might point out that the Ecuadoran
                            Government imposes an export tax of 12 percent of the value of the
                            shipments of that commodity. Under the new law, this would leave a
                            balance of only 8 percent as the estimate by that Government of the
                            value of exports of mineral earth which return to Ecuador to cover all
                            the production costs of that commodity in the country. You might cite
                            any recent data, such as that included with your despatch no. 447 of
                            April 19, 1938 [<hi rend="italic">1939</hi>],<note n="24" xml:id="d574fn1">Not printed.</note> which you believe to be
                            reliable, which you may be able to secure to show the actual percentage
                            of the value of exports of mineral earth returned to Ecuador in recent
                            years from exports of that product.</p>
                        <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0621"/>
                        <p>With regard to crude petroleum you might also endeavor to secure reliable
                            information from local sources with which to support any statements you
                            may make to the Foreign Minister showing that the estimate of 15 percent
                            would appear to be much less than the proportion of the value of exports
                            of that product from Ecuador which actually returns to the country.</p>
                        <p>The law would also appear to be deficient in that it apparently fails to
                            take into account invisible credit items such as investments of foreign
                            capital, expenditures of tourists in Ecuador, and so forth. It is the
                            Department’s understanding that new capital investments in the country
                            are considerable, particularly in the case of the United States in
                            mining enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Supplementing recent instructions on the general question of Ecuadoran
                            import restrictions since the effective date of the trade agreement, you
                            should inform the Foreign Minister that while it is a matter of
                            increasing concern to your Government that the Ecuadoran Government has
                            up to the present time not modified the control system in respect of
                            imports from the United States so as to bring it into conformity with
                            the provisions of Articles VII and VIII of the agreement, your
                            Government views with sympathy and understanding the economic and
                            financial problems with which the Government of Ecuador is faced and
                            recognizes that in times of exchange stringency it may be necessary to
                            restrict the total amount of imports so as to keep that amount within
                            the actual exchange availabilities. However, any necessary restrictions
                            need not be applied on a bilateral balancing basis, which is unsound
                            economically and inherently discriminatory. They can be imposed on a
                            non-discriminatory basis, in accordance with the provisions of the trade
                            agreement and the broad principles of commercial policy endorsed
                            repeatedly by conferences of the American States and by other nations
                            pursuing liberal trade policies.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department fully informed of any pertinent
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: At the request of my
                                Government, I desire to bring to the attention of Your Excellency’s
                                Government the concern of the Government of the United States with
                                respect to the possible effects upon the commercial relations
                                between the United States and Ecuador, with particular reference to
                                the provisions of the trade <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0622"/>agreement between our Governments signed August 6, 1938, of the
                                law enacted by the Ecuadoran Congress on February 25, 1939 and
                                approved by the President on March 3, 1939, dealing with the method
                                of determining the export values of crude petroleum, mineral earth
                                and gold bullion and specie and providing for the basing of quotas
                                for imports from individual countries upon the value of Ecuadoran
                                exports to such nations.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the relation of that law to the trade agreement, the
                                arbitrary elimination from the value of exports from Ecuador to the
                                United States, for the purpose of computing such value, of mineral
                                earth and crude petroleum except for the percentages indicated,
                                would undoubtedly have the effect, in accordance with the terms of
                                Article 4 of the law under reference, of necessitating import
                                control measures on the part of Ecuador to reduce imports from the
                                United States. It may be pointed out that no provisions exist in the
                                trade agreement which would permit restrictions to be imposed upon
                                imports from the United States for the reasons set forth in the law.
                                Such restrictions of imports from the United States would therefore
                                appear to contravene the provisions of the trade agreement. The
                                method by which the Government of Ecuador might, if necessary,
                                restrict imports from the United States, is set forth in Articles
                                VII and VIII.</p>
                            <p>Further with respect to the relation of the Ecuadoran law under
                                reference to the trade agreement, it would appear that if a portion
                                or all the value of certain exports to the United States were
                                eliminated from commercial statistics for purposes of calculating
                                the balance of trade between Ecuador and the United States, those
                                statistics might reveal an import balance for Ecuador. The question
                                therefore arises as to whether Your Excellency’s Government would in
                                accordance with the provisions of existing legislation, increase
                                customs duties on all imports from the United States (unless such
                                legislation may be presumed to have been superseded by the new law).
                                It is evident that if such action were taken, there would result a
                                clear contravention of the provisions of Article I of the agreement
                                in so far as products included in Schedule I are concerned, and a
                                contravention of the provisions of Article XI of the agreement with
                                respect to all other articles imported into Ecuador from the United
                                States unless import duties were also increased to the same extent
                                upon like articles imported from all other countries.</p>
                            <p>From the foregoing, it will be clear to Your Excellency why my
                                Government views with great concern the possible effect of the law
                                under reference on the trade agreement between our countries. My
                                Government strongly hopes that the legislation referred to may be
                                amended at an early date, and before its provisions have become
                                effective in respect of the trade between the United States and
                                Ecuador, in <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0623"/>order to take
                                into account the terms of the trade agreement of August 6, 1938.</p>
                            <p>From the above considerations with respect to the relation between
                                the law of March 3, 1939 and the trade agreement, it is equally
                                clear that the effectuation of that law would have a most
                                unfortunate effect on the general trade relations between the United
                                States and Ecuador, and in the opinion of my Government might well
                                lead to demands by various affected interests in the United States
                                for retaliatory action by my Government.</p>
                            <p>Further, with respect to the provisions of article 4 of the law under
                                reference, which would in effect place Ecuadoran foreign trade upon
                                a bilateral trade balancing basis, my Government cannot but feel
                                that this represents a complete departure from the broad policies
                                espoused by the United States and other countries in recent years
                                for the freeing of world trade from such restrictive and inherently
                                discriminatory measures. In the carrying out of these broad policies
                                my Government has continued to hope for the support of Your
                                Excellency’s Government in giving effect to the declarations adopted

                            system of quotas by nations instead of by individuals.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            meeting mentioned in my telegram No. 36 of May 13, 1 p.m., 1939, took
                            place on Tuesday in the form of a luncheon at the Legation attended by
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ricardo Ortiz, Chief of Commercial
                            and Consular Affairs, Dr. Alejandro Ponce Borja, Mr. Luke of the South
                            American Development Company, Messrs. Nester of Guayaquil, Gade<note n="29" xml:id="d578fn29">Gerhard Gade, Second Secretary of
                                Legation.</note> and myself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Luke orally gave figures included in his letter to me, sent with
                            despatch No. 447 of April 19, 1939,<note n="30" xml:id="d578fn30">Not
                                printed.</note> and these he amplified with other data which came
                            out naturally as those present asked questions, but the general showing
                            was that the Mining Company he represents actually brought back into
                            Ecuador during 1938 (at least according to Mr. Luke’s figures)
                            approximately 83% of the total of its exports from Ecuador.</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0625"/>
                        <p>Dr. Tobar remained unconvinced, and said he wished to study the matter
                            further.</p>
                        <p>We handed him figures brought by Mr. Nester from Guayaquil which showed
                            that our country was buying more cocoa during the early months of 1939
                            than usual; also that its coffee purchases in 1938 were greater in kilos
                            than in 1937, albeit the dollar value was less due to lower prices and
                            exchange. We tried to show that we were doing our part. Dr. Tobar, as
                            always, said he wished to do the right thing but needed more data from
                            Mr. Luke. Mr. Luke offered to furnish any figures Dr. Tobar might
                            request. It is understood that Mr. Luke’s Company will supply as nearly
                            as possible the data desired by Dr. Tobar by handing him its figures,
                            either Saturday or Monday next. Dr. Tobar has indicated that immediately
                            he receives the figures and has time to analyze them he will make a
                            proposal.</p>

                        <p>25. Your telegram 36, May 13, 1 p.m. and despatch 492, May 19. Your
                            telegram 36 refers to Department’s telegram 22 of May 11 concerning
                            compliance by the Ecuadoran Government with import control provisions of
                            the trade agreement.</p>
                        <p>Your despatch 492 refers to your telegram 36 but is concerned with an
                            entirely different matter, the application of Ecuadoran law of March 3
                            on the percentage of the export values of certain products which may be
                            allowed for statistical purposes.</p>
                        <p>While you should continue to press for a satisfactory solution of the
                            latter question in accordance with the Department’s instruction no. 112
                            of May 5, you should concentrate your attention on the matter of
                            Ecuadoran compliance with the import control provisions of the trade
                            agreement, in accordance with the Department’s telegram 22 of May 11 and
                            previous instructions on that subject. The 30-day consultation period
                            envisaged in Article VII will expire on June 2. There remains very
                            little time, therefore, for us to receive and consider specific
                            proposals requested.</p>

                        <p>41. Department’s telegram No. 25, May 24, 7 p.m. If Department desires
                            now to modify trade agreement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0626"/>orally suggests fixing as the
                            annual quota for the United States of 40 million sucres. However, it is
                            now proposed to modify the regulations governing import control,
                            establishing instead of import permits a deposit of 30% of the value of
                            merchandise ordered. He added that if the latter is approved our
                            commerce probably would benefit since most United States exports consist
                            of necessities.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Ecuador profoundly regrets having to suggest this
                            reduction, but if the 30% method is not approved, the same principle as
                            now suggested in our case will be applied to all countries with which
                            Ecuador has commercial relations.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister regards the present as a transitory situation likely
                            to exist until exports can be increased which should result if Ecuador
                            obtains a loan.</p>
                        <p>The Central Bank this afternoon approved 30% plan described above, but it
                            must receive the approval of the Council of State and there is much
                            opposition on the part of Chambers of Commerce. Notwithstanding the
                            opposition the Minister for Foreign Affairs hopes that a decision as to
                            the changes indicated will be made soon, but if matter is not settled
                            prior to June 1 he will give me a note confirming the above mentioned
                            quota for the United States.</p>

                                        communication from the Minister of the United States of
                                        North America to your Ministry, regarding the fulfilment of
                                        the Legislative Decree of March 3rd last, concerning the
                                        manner of computing the trade balance of the exportations of
                                        crude petroleum, mineral earth and gold in bars, and its
                                        relation to the Trade Agreement signed between Ecuador and
                                        the United States of North America on August 6, 1938. The
                                        Ministry under your worthy charge was good enough to quote
                                        the said note and to request me to advise you thereon as
                                        soon as possible. I can give you my opinion as follows: The
                                        above-mentioned Legislative Decree was issued by the last
                                        Extraordinary Congress, being based on the fact that, as
                                        regards Ecuadorean economy; the exportation of mineral earth
                                        and petroleum represents, in reality, a supply of foreign
                                        exchange to the country only in the proportion set forth in
                                        the said Decree, and I understand that it was the Ministry
                                        of Foreign Affairs which promoted the enactment of the
                                        Decree in question, for the reasons mentioned. Consequently,
                                        the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should maintain, in my
                                        opinion, the same reasons in reply to the note of the
                                        Minister of the United States. The Legislative Decree of <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0628"/>March 3rd last,
                                        does not refer expressly to the exportations from Ecuador to
                                        the United States, as one might assume from the note of the
                                        Minister of that country, but to petroleum, mineral earth,
                                        and gold, destined to any country, without any complaint
                                        having been received, as far as I know, from any country.
                                        While it is certain that, in making the deductions provided
                                        for in the Law in question, the figures of exports to the
                                        United States may be reduced to the point where it appears
                                        that (Ecuador) has an unfavorable trade balance with that
                                        country, this situation in perspective has no way changed
                                        the preference which the Import Control, under this Bank,
                                        observes with respect to the heavy purchases which,
                                        generally, are made from the United States, a country
                                        heading sales to Ecuador.</p>

                     </p>
                            <p>As Your Excellency may confirm, the purpose which inspired the
                                Legislative Decree of March 3rd of this year, is essentially
                                economic and is not concerned with special means of appreciating the
                                various markets which supply themselves with Ecuadorean production.
                                Thus, the provisions constituting the same, do not exclusively or
                                partially affect certain countries, except that their application,
                                of a uniform, general, and absolutely impartial character, creates
                                unfavorable projections in the volume of the trade balance, for all
                                those nations which buy from us products of mineral origin that are
                                set forth in the Decree in question.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, as the President of the Central Bank well says, the
                                operation of the said Decree has not prevented the normal commercial
                                development between my country and that so worthily represented by
                                Your Excellency; nor has it created any obstacles to the free and
                                favorable issuance of permits for the importation of merchandise
                                from the United States of America.</p>

                                    percentage of such imports not less than the percentage of total
                                    Ecuadoran imports supplied by the United States during a
                                    previous representative period, for example, 1936–38. During
                                    that period the United States supplied about 34 percent of total
                                    Ecuadoran imports. My Government assumes that such restriction
                                    will be administered by the Government of Ecuador in a fair and
                                    equitable manner as between imports of individual commodities
                                    and that in the application of the Ecuadoran import control
                                    system, no other or more onerous formalities or requirements
                                    will be imposed in connection with imports from the United
                                    States than those imposed in connection with imports from any
                                    other country.”</p>

                        <p>42. Department’s No. 27, May 29, 4 p.m. After acquainting the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs with the contents of Department’s telegram under
                            acknowledgment Dr. Tobar said that he would send me a note by tomorrow
                            making the proposal of 40 million sucres and I replied that immediately
                            upon receipt I would send him a note containing the points mentioned in
                            Department’s telegram No. 27 and it was my understanding that this would
                            complete the negotiations for the time being. He did not ask about
                            publicity being given to the exchange of notes nor did I refer
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tobar stated that yesterday, after the new Minister of Finance had
                            taken office, the position of the Central Bank with respect to the 30%
                            plan was fully explained to him. Some of the Chambers of Commerce have
                            requested that it be not effective until July 1 instead of June 1 as
                            originally intended. At this moment it is not possible to predict the
                            outcome.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 500 of
                            May 26, 1939, and previous correspondence, regarding the Ecuadorean Law
                            of March 3, 1939, calculating the exports of mineral earth at only 20
                            percent of its declared value, I have the honor to report that, in
                            conformity with my request (Despatch No. 492 of May 19, 1939), Mr. R. P.
                            Luke, the Resident Manager of the South American Development Company,
                            has furnished me with statistics, covering the years 1936, 1937, 1938,
                            and 1939 up to April 30th, on the production of his Company, salaries
                            and taxes paid, and the amounts of dollars returned to Ecuador. Mr. Luke
                            was good enough also to have prepared a memorandum on the Cotopaxi
                            Exploration Company, a subsidiary of the South American Development
                            Company, giving details of the large investments and expenditures made
                            by the former Company up to December 31, 1938 and estimates thereof for
                            the first four months of 1939. Copies of the foregoing documents<note n="37" xml:id="d585fn37">Not printed.</note> are enclosed for the
                            Department’s information.</p>
                        <p>While it appears that the Government either cannot or will not take steps
                            to repeal or amend the Law of March 3, 1939, before the Congress
                            convenes in August, it is believed that it might consent, in spite of
                            its uncompromising note No. 61 D. C. of May 18, 1939 (Despatch No. 500
                            of May 26, 1939), to recommend a higher percentage than the present 20
                            percent. The figures furnished by the American gold-mining companies
                            should prove valuable in showing that the computation of 20 percent is
                            inequitable.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, I have the honor to inquire
                            whether the Department wishes me to, maintain the attitude expressed in
                            the draft note contained in its instruction No. 112 of May 5, 1939, that
                            the Law of March 3, 1939 contravenes the provisions of the Trade
                            Agreement, or whether consideration should be given to a possible
                            proposal to increase the 20 percent to a larger percentage.</p>
                        <p>The French Minister, who learned of the draft law when it was first
                            introduced into the Assembly last year, secretly agreed with the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs to accept the computation of petroleum at 15
                                <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0631"/>percent, in case the
                            Franco-Ecuadorean trade agreement were concluded.</p>
                        <p>The British Chargé d’Affaires confidentially states that his Government
                            has made no objections, in view of the fact that the Ecuadorean
                            Government recently removed Great Britain from the list of countries on
                            whose products a 50 percent surcharge tax is imposed upon importation
                            into Ecuador, although Ecuador had an unfavorable trade balance of about
                            31 percent with Great Britain last year.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your telegrams nos.
                            42, 43 and 44 of May 30, June 1 and June 2, 1939,<note n="38" xml:id="d586fn38">Telegram No. 44 of June 2 not printed.</note>
                            respectively, and to your despatches nos. 497 and 510 of May 26 and June
                            2, 1939, respectively,<note n="39" xml:id="d586fn39">Neither
                                printed.</note> regarding the question of securing the compliance of
                            the Ecuadoran Government with the import control provisions of the trade
                            agreement between the United States and Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>With the exchange of notes between the Foreign Minister and yourself, the
                            formal action called for by the provisions of the trade agreement may be
                            considered to have been fulfilled. In its revised form as reported in
                            your telegram no. 44, however, the Foreign Minister’s note of June 2 is
                            not completely satisfactory, but it is believed that it may be
                            considered adequate. For example, in the first paragraph Dr. Tobar
                            states that “while the system of control of importations is in effect”,
                            imports from the United States may be limited to 40,000,000 sucres. The
                            qualification in your note of May 30 read “as a temporary measure
                            pending further clarification of the Ecuadoran import system”. In case
                            future difficulties should arise on this point, reference may be made to
                            the terms of your note.</p>
                        <p>As another example, the elimination of the fourth paragraph of the
                            original draft of the Foreign Minister’s note, while satisfactory in
                            removing any connection with the law of March 3, 1939, also removes the
                            minimum percentage figure of total Ecuadoran imports which the
                            40,000,000 sucres are to represent. However, the third paragraph of Dr.
                            Tobar’s note of June 2 states that his Government “will take strictly
                            into account” the proportion of Ecuador’s total imports supplied by the
                            United States in the years 1936–38, inclusive.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the question of giving publicity to the arrangement, the
                            Department appreciates the reasons advanced by the Foreign Minister <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0632"/>for wishing to avoid publishing
                            the terms of that temporary agreement. However, the provisions of
                            article VIII of the trade agreement provide for the giving of public
                            notice of the amounts of permitted imports. Further, traders in both the
                            United States and Ecuador are entitled to have that information. The
                            Department is of the opinion, therefore, that the Ecuadoran Government
                            should in the near future issue a statement along the lines of that
                            which the Department proposes to issue here. This statement, a copy of
                            which is enclosed,<note n="40" xml:id="d586fn40">Not printed.</note>
                            gives the substance of the arrangement worked out with the Ecuadoran
                            Government, and the Department would like to issue it concurrently with
                            the release of a similar statement by the Ecuadoran Government. You may
                            show the enclosed draft to the Foreign Minister, indicating our desire
                            to have statements issued simultaneously in Washington and Quito. Any
                            release date after you receive this instruction would be satisfactory to
                            the Department, and you should telegraph a few days in advance,
                            information as to the date that may have been selected by the Foreign
                            Minister. If Dr. Tobar declines to issue a statement in Quito, you
                            should inform him that your Government feels that such action is
                            necessary in view of the provisions of article VIII and the importance
                            of informing traders in both countries. You may also inform him that the
                            Department intends to issue a statement in Washington whether or not one
                            is released in Quito.</p>
                        <p>There remains the further matter of assuring that the arrangement set
                            forth in the notes will be carried out in practice, that is, not only
                            will not less than 40,000,000 sucres of imports be permitted to enter
                            Ecuador from the United States during 1939, but that amount will
                            represent in relation to total imports into Ecuador, not less than the
                            proportion (34 percent) of such total supplied by the United States in
                            the period 1936 to 1938, inclusive. In order to do this, it will be
                            necessary for you to ascertain, as soon as possible, the value of
                            imports into Ecuador from the United States during the first five months
                            of the present year (that is, up to the approximate date of the
                            conclusion of the recent agreement). On the basis of that information,
                            it will be possible to determine what part of the permitted total of
                            40,000,000 sucres for the United States has already been supplied by
                            this country, and the balance which remains for the rest of the year.
                            Each month during the remainder of 1939 you should ascertain the amount
                            of imports into Ecuador from the United States and from all countries
                            and report this information to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Please continue to keep the Department currently informed regarding the
                            questions discussed above.</p>

                        <p>49. I have submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the text of
                            press release which accompanied Department’s instruction No. 126, June
                            15 which is satisfactory to him. Dr. Tobar informs me however that there
                            is some probability the 30% plan referred to in previous correspondence
                            will go into effect July 1. He has supplied me with a draft of the
                            latter and thinks it would be well for the Department to understand its
                            terms, after which he will be agreeable to publication of whatever
                            release the Department deems to be convenient. Copy will be forwarded by
                            air mail leaving here tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your despatch no. 500
                            of May 26, 1939, and enclosed translation of a note from the Ecuadoran
                            Foreign Minister, and to your despatch no. 507 of June 1, 1939, on the
                            subject of the relation to the provisions of the trade agreement between
                            the United States and Ecuador of the terms of the Ecuadoran law of March
                            3, 1939, which provides for the percentages of the export value of
                            certain Ecuadoran products which may be allowed for statistical purposes
                            in calculating the trade balance between Ecuador and individual foreign
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>For your own information, the reply of the Foreign Minister to your note
                            no. 45 of May 8, 1939<note n="41" xml:id="d588fn41">See note printed on
                                    <ref target="#pg_613">p. 613</ref>.</note> is unsatisfactory in
                            that it disregards completely this Government’s fundamental concern with
                            the law in question; it is no answer that the law since its effective
                            date “has not prevented the normal commercial development” between
                            Ecuador and the United States, nor “created any obstacles to the free
                            and favorable issuance of permits for the importation of merchandise
                            from the United States of America.” It is pertinent to observe, with
                            reference to the above statements quoted from the Foreign Minister’s
                            note of May 18, 1939, that to the best of the Department’s knowledge,
                            the law has not yet been applied.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the law under reference has not yet been applied does not,
                            however, diminish the concern with which this Government views <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0634"/>its provisions, both on account
                            of the conflict with the trade agreement should they be applied, and
                            because those provisions appear to confirm the commercial policy of
                            Ecuador upon a bilateral, country-by-country, trade-balancing basis, a
                            policy to which, as you know, the Government of the United States is
                            strongly opposed as being directly contrary to the trade-liberalizing
                            principles which this Government is pursuing, and for which principles
                            it is endeavoring to secure the active support of other Governments.</p>
                        <p>The important question is not the exact percentage of the value of the
                            exports of certain products which the Ecuadoran Government may permit
                            for the calculation of the country’s trade balance, but the effects of
                            such action as they relate to the treatment which may be accorded
                            imports from the United States, and the principles embodied in the
                            law.</p>
                        <p>This Government would of course be glad to receive assurances that the
                            law of March 3 would be repealed at the next session of the National
                            Assembly. If this is not possible, an adequate but less satisfactory
                            solution would be to receive assurances either that the law will be
                            amended so as to eliminate any possible conflict in practice with the
                            provisions of the trade agreement, or that, in view of the trade
                            agreement, the law will not be applied against imports from the United
                            States. In this connection, if the Government of Ecuador actually
                            complies fully with the provisions of the trade agreement and of the
                            arrangement recently concluded regarding permitted imports from the
                            United States, a considerable part of this Government’s concern with the
                            law of March 3 will disappear. Because of the principle involved,
                            however, it is believed that your efforts along the lines just indicated
                            should be continued, and to that end there is enclosed the text of a
                            further note which you are authorized to hand to the Foreign Minister at
                            an early date, once the matter of publicity has been settled in
                            connection with the question of securing Ecuadoran compliance with the
                            import control provisions of the trade agreement. It is believed that
                            the enclosed note is self-explanatory, and it is hoped that it will
                            result in a satisfactory solution of the question under reference.</p>
                        <p>You should also continue your efforts to see that the Foreign Minister is
                            supplied with information as to the actual returns to Ecuador from
                            exports of the commodities affected by the law, not primarily for the
                            purpose of having larger percentages of export values permitted by the
                            law, but more importantly as a means of securing the repeal or amendment
                            of the law, or assurances along the lines indicated above.</p>
                        <p>If it is not possible to attain any of the above objectives, the
                            Department will instruct you further upon receipt of a report as to the
                            results of the action suggested herein.</p>
                        <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>In connection with the question under discussion, it may be noted that on
                            page 3 of the draft note enclosed with the Department’s instruction no.
                            112 of May 5, 1939, reference was made in parenthesis to the apparent
                            inconsistency between various Ecuadoran laws dealing with customs and
                            import control matters. This phase of the present question does not
                            appear to have been covered by any of your despatches, and the
                            Department would appreciate receiving an explanation.</p>
                        <p>By the terms of Article 4 of the law of March 3, 1939, “the quotas fixed
                            for imports from each country shall be in proportion to Ecuadoran
                            exports to each of those countries,” with a margin of 20 percent in
                            favor of Ecuador, which would seem to imply that permitted imports from
                            any country could not exceed 80 percent of Ecuadoran exports to such
                            country. Notwithstanding the above law, by a legislative decree of March
                            7, 1939, appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Registro Oficial</hi> of
                            March 15, and enclosed with your despatch no. 421 of April 5, the basic
                            customs law was modified to provide that the Minister of Finance could
                            impose a surcharge of up to 75 percent on imports from countries whose
                            trade with Ecuador was found to be “unfavorable” to the latter by more
                            than 30 percent. Presidential Decree no. 82, effective April 1, 1939 and
                            appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Registro Oficial</hi> of that date,
                            refers to the above-mentioned legislative decree but provides for a
                            customs surcharge of 50 percent, the same as during 1938, on imports
                            from countries whose trade with Ecuador is “unfavorable” to the latter
                            by more than 30 percent. While the provisions of Presidential decree no.
                            82 appear to be transitory in that the list of countries will presumably
                            change in the future with the state of the trade balance between Ecuador
                            and individual foreign nations, as that list has changed in the past,
                            the legislative decree of March 7 appears to be basic Ecuadoran law and
                            provides for action to be taken in the event Ecuador’s trade balance
                            with any country becomes “unfavorable” to the stated extent. The
                            Department does not see, however, how Ecuador’s trade balance with any
                            country could be “unfavorable” to any extent if by the provisions of
                            article 4 of the law of March 3 permitted imports from any country may
                            not exceed 80 percent of Ecuador’s exports to that country. Inasmuch as
                            there does not appear to be anything in either the law of March 3, or
                            those of March 7 or April 1, to take care of the apparent inconsistency,
                            the Department would appreciate an explanation of which law or laws are
                            presumed to be in force at present.</p>

                                the receipt of Your Excellency’s note no. 61 DC of May 18, 1939<note n="42" xml:id="d588fn42">

                                previous note of May 8, 1939<note n="43" xml:id="d588fn43">See note

                                same subject.</p>
                            <p>I have transmitted Your Excellency’s note to my Government, which now
                                requests me once more to address Your Excellency on this
                                question.</p>
                            <p>In Your Excellency’s note under reference, it is stated that the law
                                since its effective date “has not prevented the normal commercial
                                development” between Ecuador and the United States, nor “created any
                                obstacles to the free and favorable issuance of permits for the
                                importation of merchandise from the United States of America.”
                                Without questioning these statements, my Government respectfully
                                suggests that the reason the law under reference has not operated in
                                an adverse manner against the commerce of the United States is that
                                the provisions of the law have not been placed in force up to the
                                present time.</p>
                            <p>It continues to be the hope of my Government that for the reasons
                                indicated in my previous note to Your Excellency on this subject,
                                the law in question may be repealed at an early date.</p>

                            It is assumed that the 30 percent plan supplements the <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0637"/>existing import permit system. Please
                            confirm. In any case, this Government will expect the Ecuadoran
                            Government to carry out its undertaking in the recent exchange of
                            notes.</p>
                        <p>The press release will be issued here for use on Thursday, July 6th,
                            unless the Foreign Minister objects to that particular date. Telegraph
                            immediately if that date is satisfactory. The Department does not
                            insist, but believes it desirable that similar statement also be issued
                            in Quito.</p>
                        <p>No objection is perceived in principle to 30 percent plan, but the
                            following comments should be conveyed immediately to the Foreign
                            Minister unless published text makes them inapplicable: <list>

                                    discrimination as between countries of origin. Final

                                    such as requiring 30 percent in case of an American product and
                                    10 percent on the same product from another country.</item>

                                    conflicts with Article 11 of trade agreement. No reason is seen

                                    local currency. We cannot concur in this provision and if
                                    exemptions are granted to compensation transactions, the United
                                    States must necessarily insist upon similar exemption for

                        <p>53. Department’s confidential telegram No. 29. After conveying substance
                            to Minister for External Affairs he authorized me to say that 30 percent
                            plan completely supersedes earlier import control regulations, which now
                            may be totally disregarded, but that Ecuador’s commitments under recent
                            exchange of notes will be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Minister Tobar is agreeable to publication by us of the release which
                            accompanied Department’s instruction No. 126 on July 6 <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0638"/>but says confidentially that Ecuador
                            prefers not to publish in order to avoid difficulties with France.
                            Doctor Tobar assures me that article 15, 30-percent plan will be
                            administered impartially and that second paragraph of article 12 of our
                            trade agreement will be respected.</p>
                        <p>As to article 29, (30% plan) Minister Tobar consulted Dr. Alejandro Ponce
                            Borja, manager of Central Bank, who stated its provisions were designed
                            to care for small amount of lowest grade coffee not salable elsewhere
                            which is usually traded to Chile; adding that if we could use these
                            screenings we would receive same treatment under article 29.</p>
                        <p>Will check up on coffee screenings and report later.</p>

                        <p>30. Your 53, June 30, 5 p.m. As the 30 percent plan completely supersedes
                            earlier import control regulations, and it appears from clause <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of article 14 that import permits will be
                            issued without any restrictions on value or source of imports, following
                            30 percent deposit and presentation of application in proper form,
                            articles 7 and 8 of the trade agreement do not appear pertinent to the
                            new system. As this Government’s efforts over the past several months
                            were directed to securing compliance by the Ecuadoran Government with
                            those articles in view of their applicability to the import control
                            system then in force, the termination of that system makes pointless the
                            issuance of a press release describing an agreement worked out on the
                            basis of that system. A release will therefore not be issued here at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>For the present, you should observe closely and report on the operation
                            of the 30 percent plan, keeping in mind particularly the provisions of
                            article 11 of the trade agreement. It should be borne in mind, however,
                            that if any applications for permits covering imports from the United
                            States are rejected, the provisions of articles 7 and 8 of the trade
                            agreement once more become applicable.</p>
                        <p>Despite Ponce Borja’s explanation regarding coffee screenings, we still
                            find objection to article 29 of the new law in that, in effect, it
                            places in a preferential position trade with countries importing such
                            grades of Ecuadoran coffee and hence discriminates against all countries
                            not taking such coffee.</p>

                            588 of July 28 and 614 of August 18, 1939 and to the Department’s
                            telegram no. 39 of August 7, 1939<note n="52" xml:id="d593fn52">None
                                printed.</note> regarding the results of the trade agreement between
                            the United States and Ecuador, particularly with respect to the effect
                            upon the revenues of the Ecuadoran Government of the concessions granted
                            on various products imported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>For your own information, the Department considers that the circumstances
                            in Ecuador under which the agreement has operated since its effective
                            date have in large measure served to defeat the purposes for which the
                            agreement was negotiated. The concessions granted by Ecuador were
                            intended to stimulate exports from this country and to protect American
                            trade in the commodities affected against less favorable treatment
                            during the life of the agreement, but since the effective date of the
                            agreement import restrictions have been in effect in Ecuador apparently
                            both arbitrary in their application and in conflict with those terms of
                            the agreement providing for methods of applying such restrictions should
                            they be found necessary for any of the reasons stated therein. Any
                            comparison of imports into Ecuador before and after the effective date
                            of the agreement would not, under such circumstances, appear to be of
                            any particular value. Had there been no form of import control in effect
                            in Ecuador during the period of the agreement, or even had such control
                            been applied in accordance with the terms of the agreement, it would
                            then of course be useful to analyze imports into Ecuador from the United
                            States prior and subsequent to the effective date of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the effects of the trade agreement upon imports into the
                            United States from Ecuador, on which you have requested statistical
                            data, the concessions which this Government was in a position to offer
                            in the trade agreement consisted, as you know, almost entirely of
                            bindings upon the free list, the single exception of importance being
                            the reduction in duty granted on so-called Panama hats. The binding free
                            of duty of important Ecuadoran export products was of course of value to
                            Ecuador in assuring continuance of such favorable customs treatment.
                            Nevertheless, concessions of such a nature could not in themselves have
                            been expected to facilitate larger exports of the commodities affected
                            from Ecuador to the United States. Increases in imports of articles on
                            this country’s free list depend primarily upon improved purchasing power
                            in the United States, which is in turn dependent upon general economic
                            conditions. The comments above are for your confidential
                            information.</p>
                        <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0640"/>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, the Department does not desire that the
                            question of the results of the trade agreement be taken up with the
                            Ecuadoran Government at this time. Should officials of that Government
                            raise the question, you should request them to convey their views in the
                            form of a note or memorandum, which should be transmitted for
                            consideration by the Department.</p>

                                for the acquisition of the Galápagos Islands. There is hereby
                                authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry

                                    commercial base under whatever terms would be a matter of

                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>No consultation was held with the War and Navy Departments at the time
                            this report was framed, since this Department had understood from
                            communications of the War and Navy Departments received in previous
                            years that the Galápagos Islands were of no considerable positive
                            strategic value to this Government, although admittedly, as stated in
                            the above paragraph, their use or possession by a non-American power
                            might be definitely embarrassing to this Government from a military as
                            well as from a political point of view.</p>
                        <p>It would appear, however, that due possibly to the great advances which
                            have taken place in military and naval science and to the <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0642"/>general world situation, the War
                            Department is now of the opinion that the acquisition by the United
                            States of the Galápagos Islands and as a corollary thereto, of Cocos
                            Island, is desirable, and contemplates so recommending to the Chairman
                            of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.
                            There is enclosed in this connection a copy, referred to this Department
                            for comment by the Director of the Budget, of a proposed letter from the
                            Secretary of War to Mr. McReynolds.<note n="58" xml:id="d596fn58">Not
                                printed.</note> I am unaware of the recommendation which the Navy
                            Department has made or contemplates making in the premises.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that your own views on the future of the Galápagos
                            Islands contemplate the formation of a plan under which there would be
                            established a virtual joint trusteeship of the American republics over
                            the Islands whereby they would be administered as an international wild
                            life reserve by a board of the Pan American Union. While the Islands
                            would, of course, remain nominally under Ecuadoran sovereignty, this
                            sovereignty would be limited, and they would be kept under constant
                            vigilance by an international joint patrol representing the American
                            republics.</p>
                        <p>It was with this end in view that the Delegation of the United States at
                            the Eighth International Conference of American States at Lima
                            introduced a project for nature protection and wild life preservation,
                            which in slightly modified form was approved by the delegations of the
                            American states as Resolution XXXVIII on December 23, 1938,<note n="59" xml:id="d596fn59">Resolution XXXVIII, Nature Protection and Wildlife

                            my understanding that it is your hope that at some future date the
                            importance of the Committee of Experts to be established as a result of
                            this Resolution may be built up to a point where such an inter-American
                            body could undertake the direct administration of the Galápagos Islands.
                            You will recall that unfortunately the Government of the Republic of
                            Ecuador has been in such a fluid political condition that it was felt
                            impossible before the Conference to approach it with any proposal of the
                            character mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>May I have your authorization to inform the Secretaries of War and of the
                            Navy that you do not desire those two Departments at this time to
                            recommend the approval of resolutions pending in the Congress providing
                            for the acquisition by the United States of territory belonging to the
                            other American republics?</p>

                            October 20, 1939,<note n="60" xml:id="d597fn60">Not printed.</note>
                            regarding the establishment of the Ecuadorean Maritime Safety Zone,
                            which includes the Galápagos Islands, I have the honor to inform the
                            Department that, on November 3, the Director General of the American
                            Union, Señor Manuel Corona Cid, interviewed the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, Dr. Tobar Donoso, for an article to appear in the next edition
                            of the Union’s bulletin, the <hi rend="italic">Heraldo Americano</hi>,
                            published in Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>Señor Corona enquired whether Ecuador had negotiated [regarding] the
                            Galápagos Islands with the United States, in view of persistent rumors
                            to this effect in Argentina, Uruguay and other South American countries.
                            Dr. Tobar categorically denied any negotiations whatsoever. In reply to
                            a query as to the alleged plan of the United States Navy Department to
                            establish a naval base in the Galápagos, Dr. Tobar declared that the
                            Foreign Office had no official knowledge thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Director General of the American Union then enquired as to what
                            effect the conclusions reached at the Panama Conference would have on
                            the use of the Galápagos Islands by the United States Navy as a guaranty
                            of American neutrality and for the defense of the zone included in
                            Ecuadorean territorial waters. Dr. Tobar replied that the Declaration of
                                Panama<note n="61" xml:id="d597fn61">
                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,
                                    <ref target="#pg_36">p. 36</ref>.</note> established the safety
                            zone adjacent to American territory and that within this zone were
                            included the Galápagos Islands. He added that the Declaration also
                            stated that the American countries should agree upon the individual or
                            collective patrol of that zone.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Señor Corona asked whether ports would remain open to the
                            entry of United States warships, without prior notice or permission. The
                            Foreign Minister in reply declared that “The entry of United States
                            warships into ports of the Continent is subject today, as before the
                            Panama Conference, to the same rules of international courtesy”.</p>

                        <p>37. In a conversation this morning the Minister of Foreign Affairs<note n="1" xml:id="d598fn1">Leon Laleau.</note> showed great disquietude

                            thereto. Reference was made to a talk with Duggan<note n="2" xml:id="d598fn2">Laurence Duggan, Chief of the Division of the

                            President Vincent’s, and which appear now to contemplate the following

                            reiterated by the Haitian delegation at the Lima Conference.<note n="4" xml:id="d598fn4">For correspondence concerning this Conference, see

                                    1</ref> ff.</note> This declaration would take the logical step
                            of referring to concrete Haitian contribution to hemispheric defense in
                            the form of necessary protective works and an air base, et cetera, in
                            the region of Gonaives, whether on the mainland or on the island of
                            Gonave, or both to be undertaken and maintained by the United States.
                            This declaration would be replied to by a statement by the United
                            States. Our delegation would fall in with the idea and at the same time
                            would contain phraseology constituting a guarantee by the United States
                            of the political and territorial sovereignty of Haiti. Furthermore there
                            should, if possible, be simultaneously a similar exchange of
                            declarations with the Dominican Government <hi rend="italic">mutatis
                                mutandis</hi> or at least the offer of such parallel action.</p>

                        <p>The presence of a large part of our fleet at Gonaives and the numerous
                            naval visits at Port-au-Prince and elsewhere have confirmed the
                            tremendous popularity of the navy here and the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs’ statement with regard to the genuine pro-Americanism of the
                            Haitian people. I believe that now is the time to capitalize this to
                            Haiti’s benefit and our own.</p>

                        <p>38. My number 37, March 23, 11 p.m. In further explanation of the Haitian
                            Government’s ideas both the “necessary protective works” and the “air
                            base” in the region of Gonaives would be as much or as little as we
                            desired. The main thing apparently is that the Haitian Government
                            desires American naval or military establishment of some sort in the
                            country. This would complement and give added strength and emphasis to
                            the virtual naval base which we now have at Gonaives by virtue of the
                            arrangement whereby we simply notify time of the arrival of warships,
                            rather than ask permission for their presence in Haitian waters. My own
                            idea would be that these “necessary protective works” and the “air base”
                            should be initiated on a small scale, capable of whatever development
                            experience or international politics might indicate.</p>

                        <p>28. Your 37, March 23, 11 p.m., and 38, March 24, 10 a.m. Tour two
                            telegrams under reference have been given careful and sympathetic
                            study.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes that as a result of the Good Neighbor policy the
                            military and naval forces of the United States will always be cordially
                            welcomed wherever they may go in the American republics. Happily this
                            would now seem to be the case in Haiti. Every facility and courtesy has
                            been afforded our naval forces during recent maneuvers in the
                            neighborhood of Haiti and as you know, the Bay of <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0647"/>Gonaives has been found particularly
                            adaptable for certain types of naval training operations. The Navy
                            Department has every intention of continuing its visits to Haiti as long
                            as these visits are welcome.</p>
                        <p>However, the establishment and maintenance of permanent United States
                            military and naval works on foreign soil would require the negotiation
                            of the proper agreements, and secondly, appropriation of the necessary
                            funds by the Congress. The attendant publicity with its possible
                            repercussions both in the United States and abroad, especially in the
                            other American republics, need scarcely be developed.</p>
                        <p>After mature consideration, the Department has become convinced that it
                            would not be far-sighted policy for the United States to establish and
                            maintain in times of peace military and naval works in countries where
                            it has not already acquired rights under existing treaties or where
                            strategic considerations are not exigent, and in this latter case only
                            after the negotiation of a mutually satisfactory agreement.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly the Department feels obliged to request you to discourage
                            this feature of the proposal as presented, although far from perceiving
                            any objection to a formal declaration by the Haitian Government with
                            respect to hemispheric defense amplifying its statement of November 14,
                                1938,<note n="5" xml:id="d600fn5">
                        <p>The pertinent paragraph of the

                                    Laleau to Mr. Mayer read: “It is with this thought in mind that
                                    it is particularly agreeable to thank you for the important
                                    documents which you were good enough to communicate to us, and
                                    to say that we engage ourselves once more to work in perfect
                                    accord with your Government in all that concerns the defense and
                                    safeguarding of our Continent, for the maintenance and
                                    perpetuation of the high ideal of peace and of Pan American
                                    fraternity which constitutes the most beautiful example of
                                    humanity and stability which one could offer to a world which
                                    seems to have lost its sense of international equilibrium and
                                    universal security.”</p>
                                <p>The “important documents” mentioned above, were the latest

                     </note> the Department would welcome such a declaration
                            providing it were couched in general terms. Should the Haitian
                            Government be disposed to make such a declaration, prior consultation
                            regarding its content and form would appear to be highly desirable.</p>

                            Haitian authorities, you will be able to explain our position. As stated
                            above, it is our hope that through the naval visits made now from time
                            to time a sense of mutual interest will be built up which will be every
                            bit as strong as a written agreement supplemented by the establishment
                            and maintenance of actual military and naval works.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to Department’s
                            telegram No. 28, March 30th, 3:00 P.M. and previous correspondence on
                            the subject of an exchange of declarations between the American and
                            Haitian Governments with regard to naval bases, guarantee of
                            sovereignty, etc.</p>
                        <p>I carried out the Department’s instructions this morning in a
                            conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in view of the
                            continued absence of President Vincent in the north. I believe I was
                            able successfully to fulfill the Department’s wishes in this regard and
                            that the situation was explained to M. Laleau in a manner calculated to
                            avoid any wounding of Haitian sensibilities, although it seemed quite
                            evident that the Minister of Foreign Affairs was disappointed.</p>

                            enclosed in translation<note n="6" xml:id="d602fn6">Not printed.</note>
                            a portion of a chapter of the new book shortly to be issued by President
                            Vincent entitled <hi rend="italic">Imposant les Jalons</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Marking Out the Fundamentals</hi>).</p>
                        <p>This declaration, for such it really is, appeared in large type headlines
                            across the front page of all the newspapers of yesterday, July the
                            fourth. Both President Vincent and the Minister of Foreign Affairs told
                            me quite plainly at the Legation Reception that this declaration was
                            published on that day both as a compliment to the United States and
                            because the contents of the declaration were concerned so intimately
                            with the close relations which President Vincent considered his country
                            should have with the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>The declaration begins with a carefully thought out and expressed
                            exposition of the point of view of our country and its desires with
                            respect to the peace of the world, our attitude toward hemispheric
                            defense and, in some detail, the strategic and tactical position of the
                                <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0649"/>Greater Antilles in the
                            whole scheme of the defense of the United States and of the Americas in
                            the event of war.</p>
                        <p>This exposition and argumentation leads up to the following final
                            statements: (Translation) <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is, therefore, evident that our (Haitian) geographic position
                                    assigns to us a role of the first importance in the strategy
                                    providing for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Since these
                                    are the facts, which cannot be otherwise, does it not seem that
                                    the moment has come to give concrete and effective form to the

                                <p>“While it has been well understood that in case of war or a
                                    menace of war on our continent consultations would take place to
                                    eliminate this menace, yet the menace of war is permanent today
                                    and war is more and more apt to come by surprise. The
                                    independence of states is frequently crushed without a blow
                                    being struck and a policy of ‘<hi rend="italic">fait

                                    international law. War is now made without any declaration,
                                    since juridically and to take a present example, there is no war
                                    between Japan and China.</p>
                                <p>“Secondly, it is necessary in safeguarding peace always to be
                                    ready to make war. There is no longer time to ‘consult’, when
                                    the moment to act has already struck. Isn’t it much wiser to
                                    determine in advance conditions and the form of collaboration
                                    and cooperation for each of us in the work of common defense,
                                    envisaged perhaps a little too theoretically until now? It is
                                    not when the conflagration has been lighted that the means
                                    should be established for the preservation of the houses so
                                    menaced. Having decided to act together, each American state
                                    should be ready on the line to help extinguish the flames.</p>
                                <p>“It is for these reasons that I suggested the conclusion some
                                    months ago within the framework of the principles proclaimed at
                                    Buenos Aires and Lima, of a Mutual Assistance Pact between the
                                    United States of America and the three governments of the
                                    Antillean Ocean, since in case of peril and by reason of their
                                    geographic position they constitute the principal bases for the
                                    defense of our continent. This Pact, once concluded, could be
                                    extended to the other nations of the Americas. It would
                                    contribute without any doubt not only to the assurance of a
                                    continuity of the humane Policy of the Good Neighbor,
                                    inaugurated and pursued by President Roosevelt, but also it
                                    would definitely establish that common security in the shadow of
                                    which our country, as well as the countries closest to the
                                    United States, will discover the only ‘<hi rend="italic">climat</hi>’ in which they could favorably find their
                                    evolution in peace and in prosperity”.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>As President Vincent indicates in the closing paragraph of the above
                            quotation, he and his Minister of Foreign Affairs have discussed <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0650"/>this matter of a Mutual
                            Assistance Pact both with Mr. Duggan, the Chief of the Division of
                            American Republics, during his visit here last February and with myself
                            on several occasions. President Vincent brought the matter up again only
                            a week ago. Indeed, M. Laleau has several times stated to me that
                            President Vincent desires not only such a Mutual Assistance Pact, but,
                            in order to make it “concrete” and to the best advantage for all
                            concerned, he envisages the establishment in Haiti of an United States
                            military base, either on the island of Gonave or on the mainland, under
                            American Navy or Army control, or both;—in fact, wherever and whatever
                            we desire. In pursuing this whole question with me yesterday at our
                            Fourth of July Reception I gathered from Laleau that President Vincent
                            wishes this “concrete” accompaniment of a Mutual Assistance Pact in
                            whatever form we would consider most practicable.</p>
                        <p>I beg to refer at this point to my telegrams No. 37 and No. 38 of March
                            23rd and 24th, 1939, and the Department’s reply No. 28 of March
                            30th.</p>
                        <p>Following out the Department’s instructions, I have in the past
                            discouraged President Vincent and the Minister of Foreign Affairs with
                            respect to a Mutual Assistance Pact, etc. I have indicated that, with
                            the large scale fortifications planned for Puerto Rico, Haiti’s
                            immediate defense problems would seem to be automatically provided for
                            and that, furthermore, in such circumstances there would seem to be no
                            necessity for any military works on this island. As to the Pact itself,
                            I have indicated to President Vincent the possible embarrassment with
                            respect to the Policy of Pan Americanism. Despite these discouragements
                            on my part, the idea of a Mutual Assistance Pact and the establishment
                            of some form of American military base in Haiti has continued to occupy
                            President Vincent’s mind, until I rather feel that it is now an <hi rend="italic">idée fixe</hi>. In proof of this we now have the
                            public declaration, as reported in this despatch.</p>
                        <p>While there is every reason to believe that these are President Vincent’s
                            considered wishes, I took occasion in a recent conversation with the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, when this subject was broached, to ask him
                            to ascertain exactly what President Vincent’s desires may be in the
                            premises. M. Laleau said that he would be seeing the President at
                            Kenscoff within the next day or two and would report to me the result of
                            his conversation. I shall, therefore, hope to communicate further with
                            the Department on this subject at an early date.</p>

                            continues to publish almost daily articles and editorials in line with
                            the statements in President Vincent’s new book published in the press of
                            July 4. Eulogy of the United States and pro-American-phrased articles
                            are appearing not only in Vincent’s own newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Haiti Journal</hi>, but also in <hi rend="italic">Le Matin</hi> and

                            These articles give every evidence of being part of a press campaign.
                            They are undoubtedly inspired if not prepared in collaboration with
                            President Vincent. They are increasingly frank as to the “geographical
                            realities” in the Caribbean, the necessity for a mutual assistance pact
                            and its concrete defensive consequence.</p>

                                printed.</note> For the reasons set forth below, you should call
                            immediately upon President Vincent and express the following views:</p>
                        <p>Please inform him that the Government fully appreciates the motives which
                            have led him once again to advance a concept for a mutual assistance
                            pact in the Caribbean. This Government is deeply gratified to have this
                            renewed assurance of M. Vincent’s support of the doctrine of continental
                            solidarity, and this further evidence of his friendship, and that of his
                            country, for the United States.</p>
                        <p>You should tell him that the President and this Government are working
                            day and night to avoid the holocaust of war. At the same time, and in
                            order to be prepared for any emergency, prudence naturally dictates that
                            all possible measures shall be taken for the defense of this hemisphere.
                            With this in view, suggestions for mutual assistance pacts have been put
                            forward from time to time. President Vincent has again put forward this
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>As the result of the careful consideration that has been given to these
                            projects, the statement of policy was developed as set forth in the
                            Department’s telegrain no. 28 of March 30, 3 p.m. In as much as
                            President <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0652"/>Vincent has once
                            again raised his suggestion despite your best efforts, I believe the
                            time has come for you to make it unmistakably clear to him that since
                            the earliest days of this Republic, it has been and still is a basic
                            principle of policy to decline, irrespective of circumstances, to enter
                            into any offensive or defensive alliance. This cardinal principle of
                            policy has invariably received the fullest support of the American
                            people. Please, therefore, state unequivocally that the United States
                            cannot consider participating in any pact or alliance for mutual
                            assistance even with its nearest neighbors.</p>
                        <p>The present policy of this Government with respect to consultation,
                            collaboration and cooperation for the defense of this hemisphere in case
                            of any threat to peace is clearly stated in the Declaration of Lima.
                            Exchanges of views with the President of Haiti and with other Haitian
                            officials on this subject will always be welcome but this Government
                            cannot enter into commitments of the sort contemplated.</p>
                        <p>You should, of course, reiterate this Government’s high appreciation of
                            the sentiments which have motivated President Vincent in this matter and
                            assure him that due note has been taken of his laudable interest in
                            making available facilities for the common defense of this hemisphere,
                            an interest which this Government hopes will continue unabated.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information, I realize that despite your
                            best efforts the recent announcement of President Vincent was unexpected
                            and possibly unavoidable. It would be most unfortunate were he to
                            proceed further with this project by endeavoring to enlist the
                            participation of neighboring countries. I feel sure that you will be
                            able to convince President Vincent to abandon his proposal thereby
                            avoiding embarrassment both to the Haitian Government and to the United
                            States. [Welles.]</p>

                            President Vincent’s program. With respect to the penultimate paragraph
                            of that telegram, in case the Haitian Government should desire to make a
                            declaration such as that envisaged, you are instructed <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0653"/>to make it unmistakably clear in
                            advance that this Government cannot conceive of any reason at the
                            present time which might render it necessary and advisable to establish
                            defensive military or naval works, an emergency air base or any military
                            or naval station of any kind in any foreign country or possession in the
                            Caribbean except in countries with which this Government already has
                            treaty permission. Forewarned by a knowledge of these intentions of this
                            Government, President Vincent might prefer not to make any
                            declaration.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Department is mystified by the apparently continuous
                            feeling of insecurity with respect to external aggression which you
                            state exists in Haiti. Despite occasional alarmist reports, there
                            appears to be no deep-seated similar feeling in Cuba, the Dominican
                            Republic, Puerto Rico, or any other part of this hemisphere. While of
                            course this Government cannot undertake to give any guarantees, it
                            should be obvious from the geographical location of Haiti that the
                            Government of the United States would never willingly permit any
                            non-American power to establish a dangerous foothold in Haiti, and would
                            be prepared in last analysis to use its military and naval forces to
                            preclude such a possibility. The feeling of insecurity, the Department
                            suspects, derives more from a fear of the Dominican Republic, rather
                            than of non-American powers. To avoid complications, it is clear that
                            the Haitian Government should conduct itself in a peaceful and correct
                            attitude toward the neighboring republic. If despite such a policy,
                            difficulties arise, the disposition of this Government to be helpful is
                            apparent from its efforts at the time of the Haitian-Dominican boundary
                                controversy.<note n="13" xml:id="d605fn13">See <ref target="frus1938v05#pg_178">

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that President Vincent told me yesterday that the position of the
                            Haitian Government, now that war has broken out in Europe, is exactly as
                            he outlined it in chapter five of his book, <hi rend="italic">Imposant
                                les Jalons</hi>. A copy of this entire chapter, with translation and
                            comments, was submitted to the Department by this Legation with despatch
                            No. 564, dated July 5, 1939.</p>
                        <p>President Vincent went on further to say that although he realized that
                            the question of a Mutual Assistance Pact with the United States was
                            closed for the time being, he still hoped, under the present
                            circumstances, <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0654"/>that the United
                            States Government would find it possible to establish a small air base
                            in Haiti which might be used as a stopover point for planes flying
                            between the United States and Puerto Rico. I replied to the President
                            that I thought this matter had been completely discussed and dropped for
                            the time being, but I would be glad to convey his views to the
                            Department in view of the European developments at this time.</p>
                        <p>President Vincent also reiterated his desire to cooperate in any way
                            possible with the United States Government in any eventuality.</p>

                                the Republic of Haiti has not changed materially, and I am therefore
                                obliged to request your Government to accept prolongation of the
                                Accord of July 1, 1938, for another year.</p>
                            <p>Haiti is obtaining a better comparative price for her coffee, but the
                                size of the crop seems to have suffered a permanent reduction. The
                                cause is not known, but it is generally ascribed to over aged trees.
                                The five-year average of exports of coffee has fallen from
                                31,919,197 kilos at the end of the fiscal year 1933–1934 to
                                27,803,960 kilos at the end of the fiscal year 1937–1938. On the
                                other hand, banana production is increasing, and exports will
                                probably reach 2,200,000 stems this year, or an increase of 837,000
                                stems in comparison with the exports of last year. Sugar prices have
                                improved somewhat, but an export quota has been fixed which
                                precludes much help from that source of revenue. Cotton is still
                                subject to attack from the Mexican boll weevil, and unless this year
                                brings another drought, which is unfavorable to the boll weevil,
                                increased damage to our cotton is expected. Furthermore, both cotton
                                and sisal are quoted at depressed prices.</p>
                            <p>At the end of April revenues had failed to meet estimates by Gdes.
                                842,559.06. If a further reduction in an already inadequate budget
                                is to be avoided, revenue trends must change from those existing
                                from October through April, 1939; inasmuch as the treasury balance
                                is inadequate to meet such a deficit, continuing unsatisfactory
                                revenues will require a reduction in expenditures approximating the
                                amount of the deficit in the budget of ways and means.</p>
                            <p>The May receipts have been raised in an abnormal fashion exceeding
                                the average, with reference to this month, of better years. This is
                                perhaps due to certain unexpected and extraordinary factors. For
                                example, a large importation of gasoline, a large importation of
                                material for the J. G. White Company<note n="20" xml:id="d607fn20">This company, with headquarters in New York City, had a

                            <p>I cannot therefore hope that this exceptional situation of the month
                                of May may continue, nor that it might be the proof of a permanent
                                state of Haitian Government receipts. It is why at the present
                                moment our firmest desire is to be in a position to adopt a budget
                                for the fiscal year, 1939–1940, which will not require any further
                                reductions in our reduced appropriations for the essential public
                                services.</p>
                            <p>As a result, however, of the friendly attitude that the holders of
                                the bonds of the 1922 loan have always shown towards the Haitian
                                Government and of their desire to maintain its credit at the highest
                                point, I can assure your Government that all additional receipts
                                which we will collect during the fiscal year 1939–1940 over and
                                above the amount carried in the budget 1938–1939 and all other
                                amounts which may be deemed necessary by the Secretary of State for
                                Finance, in accord with the Fiscal Representative, to be expended as
                                extraordinary appropriations to meet serious emergencies, will be
                                employed for the amortization of the 1922 [loan?].</p>
                            <p>In requesting your Government to agree to prolong the Accord of July
                                1, 1938, for a duration of one year, the Haitian Government confirms
                                its willingness to continue to execute during the period of
                                prolongation, all the obligations contained in the letter from my

                        <p>Mr. Duggan referred to a recent inquiry from Dr. Cáceres with regard to a
                            newspaper report in Habana that American officials had proceeded to Swan
                            Island in connection with the establishment of a meteorological station.
                            Mr. Duggan said that this was correct and explained that the station had
                            been established this year on the same basis as in 1938. He said that
                            the purpose of the station was to give warnings of the approach of
                            hurricanes which was of vital interest to the Governments of this
                            country, Cuba and others in the Caribbean area. He assured Dr. Cáceres
                            that this action does not imply any intention on the part of this
                            Government to modify the situation with respect to the sovereignty over
                            Swan Islands. …</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cáceres asked if it would not be possible for the Department to
                            address a note to his Government giving assurances that the
                            establishment of the meteorological station was not intended to affect
                            the respective claims of the two Governments to the Island. Mr. Duggan
                            expressed the view that this would not be necessary and referred in that
                            connection to the action of the Honduran Government in 1938 in
                            appointing a fiscal agent on Swan Island. He pointed out that this
                            Government had refrained from registering any protest against this
                            action in a desire to avoid introducing any complications into the
                            question. It was intimated that it would be desirable for the Honduran
                            Government to adopt a similar attitude toward the establishment of the
                            observation station.</p>
                        <p>At Dr. Cáceres’ request, Mr. Duggan agreed that he could inform his
                            Government that it had been agreed that the steps referred to <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0659"/>would not be made the subject
                            of correspondence between the two Governments and would not be
                            considered as in any way affecting the respective contentions of the
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cáceres expressed his satisfaction with the understanding reached in
                            the conversation.</p>

                            Honduras has on a number of occasions addressed communications to this
                            Government asserting a claim to sovereignty over the Swan Islands. The
                            Swan Islands were occupied in 1857 by American citizens for the purpose
                            of extracting guano and on February 11, 1863 a guano certificate was
                            issued by Secretary of State Seward under the Act of August 18,
                                1856.<note n="4" xml:id="d611fn4">11 Stat. 119.</note> This
                            certification had the effect of making the islands appertain to the
                            United States, which has since that time maintained effective occupation
                            and has continuously asserted sovereignty over the islands.</p>
                        <p>The Swan Islands (17°25´ No., 83°56´ W., H. O. Chart 5170) are situated
                            ninety-seven miles from the eastern coast of Honduras. The Honduran
                            claim to the islands rests almost entirely on the fact of their
                            discovery by Spanish navigators. However, no evidence has been advanced
                            that Honduras has ever occupied the islands or exercised sovereignty
                            over them. At the present time the islands are uninhabited except for a
                            lighthouse tender employed by the United Fruit Company. For the past two
                            years a meteorological station has been operated on the islands during
                            the hurricane season by the United States Weather Bureau with the aid of
                            United States Navy personnel.</p>

                        <p>In view of the active interest of this Government in the amicable
                            settlement of territorial disputes in this hemisphere I feel that it is
                            highly desirable for us to endeavor to reach a solution of the
                            controversy with the Government of Honduras over the sovereignty to the
                            Swan Islands. The opinion is held in the Department of State that the
                            most desirable method of procedure would be to endeavor by direct
                            negotiation to effect an amicable settlement of the question, and if
                            this effort is not successful, to propose to the Government of Honduras
                            the conclusion of a treaty to provide for submission of the dispute to
                            arbitration. It is believed that for reasons of broad policy this
                            Government should extend full support to the principle of resort to
                            arbitration wherever usual diplomatic negotiations have not succeeded in
                            resolving controversies between the governments in this hemisphere.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>In relation to your letter of September eighth regarding disputed
                            sovereignty over the Swan Islands off the coast of Honduras, I approve
                            seeking to settle the matter by negotiation and if such cannot be done,
                            then by submission to arbitration.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it seems to me that this dispute is in effect making a
                            mountain out of a mole hill. The Islands have practically no commercial
                            value whatsoever, are to all intents and purposes uninhabited, and, as I
                            understand it, are used only occasionally by Honduran fishing boats. I
                            cannot see, therefore, that there is any reason for the raising of a
                            nebulous ultimate sovereignty question.</p>
                        <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>On the other side of the picture, a lighthouse is maintained by an
                            American company without expense to either the United States Government
                            or the Honduran Government.</p>
                        <p>From the point of view, therefore, of peaceful uses, the problem of
                            sovereignty ought not to raise it.</p>
                        <p>In the event of a war affecting the Caribbean area, these Islands may
                            have some possible value—not to Honduras but to the United States Navy
                            in their task of maintaining continental defenses. There is little or no
                            contribution which Honduras could make to this defense for the very good
                            reason that the use of the Islands would, in all probability, be
                            confined to aircraft scouting and patrolling. In such a case the patrol
                            would be based not on the Islands themselves but on a ship which would
                            use the Islands as a lee. It is my belief that in the event of any such
                            war Honduras should receive such protection from American Navy as the
                            Islands would afford—in other words, an offshore patrol which Honduras
                            itself is not able to undertake because of the size and cost of the
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, and for the additional reason that Honduras does
                            not seem to have much of a case for sovereignty, it might be suggested
                            that Honduras relinquish her claim to sovereignty with the understanding
                            that she does so in the interest of navigation in time of peace and
                            continental defense in the event of war.</p>

                            <p>As the Senate can see, the arrangement which our Government has

                                notes does not submit to arbitration the conduct of the Government
                                of Mexico and Mexican legislation. The arrangement bears exclusively
                                on the amount of American claims, and not upon questions of
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>Attention should be called to the fact that the Government of the
                                United States agrees that payment for agrarian expropriations need
                                not be made previously nor even immediately, as it had at first
                                claimed, but will be made subsequent to said expropriations, and in
                                annual installments. I also wish to call the attention of the Senate
                                to the fact that, despite the request which the United States has
                                continued to make, Mexico does not commit herself to the suspension
                                of her agrarian policy, not even for the duration of the
                                negotiations.</p>

                            <p>Pursuant to this line of conduct, the Government has continued to
                                handle agrarian cases affecting the properties of foreigners, such
                                as the dotations made in Los Mochis, State of Sinaloa, on the 9th
                                and 11th of this month, affecting a total area of 228,343.40
                                hectares; and from Las Rusias and La Mariposa, Municipality of
                                Muzquiz, State of Coahuila, which were made on November 20 and
                                December 13th of the present year, affecting a total area of

                                contained in a simple exchange of notes, constitutes a Convention
                                according to the practices of Chancelry and the authorized opinion
                                of the most distinguished commentators on International Law (Hall’s
                                    <hi rend="italic">International Law</hi>, eighth edition, pp.
                                383–384, and the authorities therein cited), to which authorities we
                                must have recourse since the Constitution of the Republic does not
                                prescribe any definite form for treaties, requiring only that once
                                these have been negotiated by the Executive they shall be submitted
                                for approval and ratification to the Senate; in compliance,
                                therefore, with this provision of the Constitution, I submit to the
                                Senate, for its consideration and for ratification should it be
                                deemed advisable, the agreement contained in the notes quoted
                                above.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, I take pleasure in informing you that, as provided by the
                                Constitution, I am addressing to the Chamber of Deputies a proposal
                                that they authorize a special appropriation for the coming Fiscal
                                Year, so that the Government may be in a position to pay the
                                indemnities due the owners of lands expropriated under the agrarian
                                laws, with the understanding that—pursuant to the thesis which the
                                Federal Executive has firmly upheld to the Government of the United
                                States—the appropriation will be used to indemnify both foreign and
                                national landowners, so that there will be no discrimination against
                                the national dignity and the principles of Law.</p>

                            December 24, 1938, particularly the second paragraph<note n="5" xml:id="d614fn5">Second paragraph of extract printed <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> following the text of the notes
                            dated November 9–12, 1938 in the DAPP release.</p>

                            intended to allay possible domestic opposition to the arrangement but
                            possibly also with a view to the effects in other countries. In any

                            this Government has receded from its position in the matter of the
                            principle concerning prompt and effective compensation since silence on
                            this Government’s part might be held to denote acquiescence. Attempt
                            might be made later to invoke this situation as a precedent sanctioning
                            expropriation without prompt compensation.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly you are instructed to deliver a note to the Foreign Office as

                                    that the Government of the United States agrees that payment for

                        <p>Technically and provided that it is understood that the statement is
                            intended to relate alone to the cases covered by the arrangement of
                            November 9–12 1938, there is some basis for President Cárdenas’
                            statement in his Message to the Mexican Senate, that the United States
                            “accepts the fact” that with respect to agrarian expropriations payments
                            “will not be … immediate to, but subsequent to the expropriatory
                            actions”.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the cases covered by the arrangement in question, that
                            arrangement does not provide for “immediate” payment but for payment
                            after the claims have been submitted to and passed on as to the amounts
                            which should be paid by a Commission. Therefore, it may be said,
                            strictly speaking, that the United States “accepts the fact” that with
                            regard to such claims payment will be “subsequent to the expropriatory
                            actions.”</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the President’s statement related to the
                            arrangement in question which he was requesting the Mexican Senate to
                            ratify and that he referred not to a yielding on the part of the United
                            States respecting the rules and principles of international law but to a
                            “fact” with regard to payment of the particular claims covered by the
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand and “with a view to preventing any possibility of
                            misunderstanding of the position of this Government” the Department’s
                            instruction of January 14, 1939 to the American Embassy at Mexico City
                            carried out by note to the Foreign Office of January 16, 1939 was to the
                            effect that the United States had not modified the position taken in
                            previous notes that “the recognized rules of law and equity require the
                            prompt payment of full compensation for the property that may be
                            expropriated”. As reported by the Embassy in <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0666"/>its despatch of January 26, 1939, the Foreign Office
                            has replied by stating that the President’s pronouncement “should be
                            understood in its relation to the entire text of the document which
                            contains it” and that “it is clear that” he “referred exclusively and
                            specifically to the arrangement recently concluded between the two
                            countries in the matter of agrarian claims.”</p>
                        <p>In brief, it follows that this Government is on record with the Mexican
                            Government on the general principle involved and that the Mexican
                            Government has in its reply taken note of such action by this Government
                            and stated that the President’s pronouncement referred “exclusively” to
                            the existing arrangement between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that there is nothing in the correspondence which has
                            occurred or in the existing situation which would embarrass the United
                            States in maintaining its position with respect to the payment which
                            should be made for future expropriations.</p>

                        <p>The atmosphere in which the notes of November 9–12, 1938, providing for
                            the adjustment of the claims of American citizens whose lands in Mexico
                            have been expropriated since August 30, 1927, were agreed upon was one
                            of seeking to avoid protracted discussions over technical or legalistic
                            matters and of determining in an equitable and friendly manner to solve
                            the problem confronting the two governments of bringing about a prompt
                            and effective solution of the claims in question.</p>
                        <p>It is most unfortunate that any question of the interpretation of these
                            notes has arisen for the Department of State understood that the
                            solution agreed upon in the conversations and in the notes mentioned was
                            the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Mexican Government undertook to make fair compensation to
                                    American owners whose lands have been expropriated. The only
                                    questions for determination by the Agrarian Claims Commission
                                    were (1) that American citizens had in fact suffered losses
                                    through expropriation; (2) the amount of such losses.</p>
                                <p>It was hot anticipated that any arguments would be raised seeking
                                    to differentiate against any group of American owners. Moreover,
                                    it was contemplated that the Mexican Government would make
                                    appropriate compensation for the damages that American citizens
                                    had sustained, covering the value of the lands taken, plus
                                    improvements, and other losses.</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>It is strongly felt that the technicalities which have interfered with
                            proceedings relating to the agrarian claims should be promptly
                            eliminated. The Mexican Commission could study the claims with a view
                                <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0668"/>to determining their
                            reasonableness. Should it be more convenient for the Mexican Government
                            to do this, arrangements could be made to settle on the basis of the
                            total amount of the damages to American citizens through agrarian
                            expropriations rather than to have the Commissioners jointly state the
                            value of each claim. A procedure of this kind for facilitating
                            expeditious valuation of the claims would, of course, be predicated upon
                            strict adherence to the spirit, as above described, of the conversations
                            leading up to the Agreement of November 9–12, 1938 and the notes of
                            those dates.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government could not accede to any scaling down of the
                            just value of these agrarian claims or to any discrimination against any
                            group of American claimants.</p>

                        <p>I then handed the Ambassador an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> on
                            the question of the work of the Agrarian Commission of which the
                            following is the text: [Here follows text printed <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.]</p>
                        <p>I emphasized to the Ambassador my very great dissatisfaction with the way
                            in which the work of the Commission had been progressing due to the fact
                            that the Mexican Government had been so utterly unwilling to agree upon
                            the basic principles involved in the work of the two members of the
                            Joint Commission in determining the fair amount of the claims. I said
                            that if this delay continued until after the first of January the
                            Mexican Government might be sure that the question would be discussed at
                            very considerable length in the Congress of the United States and that
                            the just complaints of the claimants would be unanimously supported by
                            public opinion in this country. I said that it was over a year now since
                            the agreements constituting the Agrarian Commission had been signed and
                            that up to the present time the two Governments had not agreed upon the
                            valuation of one single claim. I concluded by saying that in view of the
                            spirit which animated the two Governments when these agreements were
                            signed, it seemed to me imperative that the two Governments now agree
                            without further procrastination upon the way in which the claims were to
                            be evaluated.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0669"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that of course the primary difficulty was the
                            question of determining whether stock held by American citizens in
                            Mexican corporations should be included in the claims to be paid and to
                            be evaluated under the agreements constituting the Agrarian Commission.
                            He said that he had just received a telephone call from the Mexican
                            Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs saying that the Mexican Government
                            believed the total value of claims presented would amount to some
                            $36,000,000 of which $21,000,000 represented the properties of five
                            Mexican corporations. Señor Beteta had implied, the Ambassador said,
                            that this $21,000,000 should not be regarded as subject to the
                            jurisdiction of the Agrarian Claims Commission. I replied that I could
                            not possibly agree to any such contention as this and that my point of
                            view on this aspect of the problem had been made clear in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> already handed the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he agreed that no legitimate distinction could
                            be made between the property of American nationals in one category or in
                            the other, but that his own task had been made infinitely more difficult
                            by the insistence of Ambassador Daniels in all of his conversations at
                            the Mexican Foreign Office that this Government was solely interested in
                            the claims of the small American landholders and that the larger
                            landholders, notably those who had incorporated their properties in
                            Mexico, had no legitimate claim for payment. The Ambassador said that
                            every time that he got to the point of getting his Government to find
                            some way out of the difficulty presented, Mr. Daniels convinced the
                            Mexican Government that there was no need to find a way out of the
                            difficulty. The Ambassador nevertheless said he would take the matter up
                            again with his Government and urge that he be instructed and authorized
                            to agree upon a global method of payment which would avoid the need of
                            divorcing claims arising from ownership in corporations from the claims
                            arising through the expropriation of properties held by Americans. I
                            replied that I would agree in principle to this procedure but with the
                            clear and specific understanding, as stated in the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, that this Government could not agree to a
                            procedure which would result in the scaling down of the just and
                            legitimate claims of American nationals whose properties had been
                            expropriated during the past twelve years.</p>

                        <p>With a view to forestalling further precipitate action in agrarian cases,
                            you are instructed to inform the Foreign Office<note n="18" xml:id="d621fn18">The Ambassador carried out this instruction in his
                                note No. 4051, December 6, to the Mexican Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> that this Government is greatly disturbed by the
                            disregard by the Mexican Government of its explicit assurance given the
                            Secretary by the Mexican Ambassador on November 10, 1938<note n="19" xml:id="d621fn19">Memorandum by the Under Secretary of State,
                                November 10, 1938, not printed.</note> that if further dotations of
                            agrarian lands were made the Mexican Government would compensate the
                            owners through prompt, effective and adequate payment. No explanation
                            has even been offered for such action as that in the Dickson case where
                            the lands were seized with the Mexican Government’s approval but without
                            assurances of prompt compensation after this Government had pointed out
                            that such compensation was expected.</p>
                        <p>When this Government exchanged notes with the Mexican Government on
                            November 9–12, 1938, it was in the belief that the troublesome agrarian
                            problem was at last solved. Not only did the agreement establish a
                            procedure for determining the value of agrarian lands seized since
                            August 30, 1927 and for paying compensation for those lands, but the
                            assurance given the Secretary on November 10, 1938 by the Mexican
                            Ambassador stated that no more agrarian seizures would be made without
                            compensation. The Mexican Government has raised legalistic obstacles to
                            the rapid settlement of the agrarian troubles which we all so earnestly
                            hoped for a year ago and now appears not desirous of maintaining good
                            faith regarding the assurances of November 10. We have no desire to
                            reopen for discussion the merits of the controversy over agrarian
                            seizures but expect the Mexican Government forthwith to observe the
                            assurances given on November 10, 1938 with respect to all cases arising
                            thereafter which are not before the Agrarian Claims Commission. The
                            Department expects the Embassy to lose no opportunity to keep before the
                            Mexican Government this Government’s position.</p>
                        <p>The Department has neither contemplated nor agreed to any waiver of the
                            assurances of November 10 above mentioned. Moreover the assurances did
                            not exclude American-owned Mexican corporations from their benefits. It
                            is accordingly most important that there should be no further
                            expropriations in the absence of simultaneous arrangement for the
                            payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.</p>

                        <p>287. Personal for the Ambassador. Department’s telegram 286, December 5,
                            7 p.m. Please telegraph immediately prospects for cancelation of
                            dotation of Dickson’s lands. Please indicate also present status of the
                            efforts you are making to have the property protected as “cattle
                            lands”.</p>
                        <p>The following will serve as your instructions only in the event that it
                            is necessary because of the time element to follow them. If prospects of
                            cancelation are not favorable please state whether it may not be
                            practicable immediately to obtain the courtesy of an extension for 30
                            days of the period allowed for fencing since the fifteen day period
                            allowed (which expires morning of December 12) is said to be
                            insufficient by at least 1 month. Meanwhile representations could be
                            further pressed for cancelation. Under present time limit the Department
                            understands it is not possible to complete fencing; the result of
                            insistence upon present orders of agrarian authorities would probably be
                            that many pure bred animals would escape into lands of agrarians,
                            causing serious financial losses to Dickson and associates.</p>
                        <p>Should the Mexican Government, in the face of representations which you
                            were instructed by the Department’s 286 to make, persist in the dotation
                            it is hoped that at least the Government will arrange to make the
                            dotation from the equivalent or better lands in the southeast corner of
                            the property. While the theoretical value of the company’s lands per
                            hectare may not be high the damages from either dotation would be
                            considerable but somewhat less in the event the change to the southeast
                            corner were made. This Government will strongly and immediately support
                            a claim of the owners for losses and damages if any of the lands are
                            expropriated and will expect prompt, adequate and effective compensation
                            for the owners in fulfillment of the assurances referred to in the
                            telegram.</p>
                        <p>The Department is in receipt of a further request from Senator

                            Beteta yesterday and Carrigan to Mena today, as it was <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0672"/>not possible to see Beteta today.
                            Beteta wrote President about case last night according to Mena and it
                            will be necessary to await his decision. As prospects for cancellation
                            are still obscure and in view of time element, Carrigan asked Mena about
                            30 day extension. Mena is taking this up with Beteta and stated it
                            appeared “reasonable request”. I shall see Beteta Monday on this.</p>
                        <p>Regarding protection as cattle land I have left memorandum reciting
                            quantity land and cattle. This of course is contingent on final award
                            regarding dotation since such inaffectability is obtainable only upon
                            formal request by owners and should have been made before dotation.</p>
                        <p>Carrigan pointed out to Mena that had company desired to make such
                            request it would have withheld its action pending reply from Foreign
                            Office and since reply was not received prior to dotation it had
                            naturally not made this request. I shall also bring this up on
                            Monday.</p>

                            which Mr. Richberg had had with <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0673"/>the Ambassador on Saturday they had both reached the conclusion that
                            negotiations between the oil companies and the Mexican Government for an
                            adjustment of the situation arising from the expropriation of the oil
                            properties were now impossible.</p>
                        <p>Before I could start the discussion of this topic the Ambassador, who
                            seemed to be very much exercised, took out of his pocket a communication
                            from his Foreign Minister which enclosed a copy of a note he had
                            received from Ambassador Daniels. The Ambassador gave me the copy of the
                            note to read but not the communication from his Foreign Minister. The
                            note from Ambassador Daniels was written in compliance with the
                            Department’s telegraphic instruction of December 5<note n="25" xml:id="d625fn25">Telegram No. 286, December 5, 7 p.m., <ref target="#pg_661">p. 661</ref>.</note> and had to do with the
                            failure of the Mexican Government to comply with the assurances given
                            the Secretary of State by the Mexican Ambassador on November 10, 1938.
                            The Mexican Ambassador said that General Hay was very much upset by the
                            note from Ambassador Daniels, and the Ambassador then went on to express
                            the opinion that no such assurances had ever been given by him to the
                            Secretary of State as those referred to in Mr. Daniels’ communication. I
                            read Mr. Daniels’ communication again and then remarked to the
                            Ambassador that I thought he and I must be talking about different
                            matters since the assurances referred to in Mr. Daniels’ communication
                            were exactly those which he had officially given to the Secretary of
                            State oh the date mentioned. The Ambassador said that the assurances he
                            had given did not imply that, in any cases of expropriation by Mexico of
                            properties not already in course of condemnation and owned by American
                            citizens, compensation would be paid by the Mexican Government. I asked
                            the Ambassador to wait a minute and sent to my files for the copy of the
                            conversation which the Ambassador had had with the Secretary of State
                            and myself on November 10, 1938, and which contained the textual
                            transcript of the Ambassador’s assurances. … I then stated that the text
                            of these assurances had been discussed between him and myself for some
                            days prior to November 10 and that our discussions had then been reduced
                            to writing; that according to what he had told me at the time, he had
                            read the assurances to President Cárdenas personally and had received
                            the explicit authorization of President Cárdenas to make these
                            assurances in the name of his Government. The Ambassador said that he
                            remembered the circumstances very well and that the text was exactly as
                            he had read it to the Secretary of State and to myself. …</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then explained to me what his difficulty was which until
                            then had been inexplicable to me. He said that the authorization which
                            he had received to convey these assurances to the Secretary <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0674"/>of State had been received personally
                            from President Cárdenas and had never passed through the Mexican Foreign
                            Office and that consequently neither General Hay nor Under Secretary of
                            State Beteta had any knowledge that these assurances had been conveyed.
                            … The Ambassador said that he would telephone General Hay and tell him
                            that he had spoken with me with regard to Ambassador Daniels’ note and
                            that the questions contained therein were questions which he, the
                            Ambassador, desired to discuss personally with President Cárdenas before
                            any action was taken by the Mexican Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>I then reminded the Ambassador that ten days had passed since I had
                            handed him a memorandum with regard to the work of the Agrarian
                            Commission and that I had received no reply and that from what the
                            Ambassador had just told me, I assumed that he would give me no reply
                            until he could communicate with President Cárdenas on the telephone. I
                            went on to say that the situation with regard to the agrarian
                            expropriations was becoming altogether intolerable. I said not only had
                            an entire year passed without a single claim being adjudicated, but new
                            expropriations were being undertaken completely counter to the
                            assurances given to this Government by the Ambassador on November 10,
                            1938, and that I was very much afraid that the situation in this
                            country, insofar as our own public opinion was concerned, had almost
                            reached the point where an explosion of public indignation on the part
                            of United States citizens was at hand. The Ambassador then said that he
                            could assure me that he had every reason to believe that this whole
                            agrarian question could be settled in a manner satisfactory to us in the
                            near future, and that he was confident that the question raised in my
                            memorandum, namely, recognition of the rights of American shareholders
                            in corporations set up in Mexico owning agrarian properties which had
                            been expropriated, was not going to create any insurmountable
                            difficulty. He also said that he was confident that his Government would
                            prevent any further new expropriations of American-owned agrarian
                            properties and that the assurances conveyed by him on November 10, 1938,
                            would be respected. I said that I was happy to know that the Ambassador
                            felt optimistic in this regard, but that I for one was beginning to lose
                            my own innate optimism insofar as this problem was concerned. I said
                            that I could not over-emphasize the seriousness with which I regarded a
                            continuation of the present situation and that it seemed to me that the
                            Ambassador must make every possible effort to impress upon his
                            Government the gravity with which this Government viewed the
                            situation.</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called to see me this afternoon. He told me in the
                            first place, with reference to our conversation on the telephone of last
                            night, that he had succeeded in speaking with President Cárdenas on the
                            telephone this morning. President Cárdenas had authorized him to say to
                            me that the Davis proposal had been submitted to him on the evening of
                            February 16 through Secretary of the Treasury Suarez and that the
                            President had immediately rejected it and said that he would not even
                            discuss it. President Cárdenas further wanted me to know that the Davis
                            proposal was not as alleged <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0676"/>by
                            Davis to the American Embassy, but contemplated the barter of 70 German
                            planes instead of 30 for Mexican oil to be repaid over a ten-year
                            period. The proposal also envisaged the sending to Mexico of a very
                            considerable number of German military and technical people. President
                            Cárdenas further wanted us to know that the Mexican Government possessed
                            only American aircraft and had no desire to obtain other than American
                            aircraft and that it would continue to deal with the United States in
                            all aviation matters. He had further authorized the Mexican Ambassador
                            here to deny to the press the truth of the report published this morning
                            that the Mexican Government was considering such a proposal and to state
                            categorically that the Mexican Government had rejected the proposal and
                            would not agree to it under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I was very much gratified by this information
                            and I asked him to express to President Cárdenas the appreciation of
                            this Government for this courtesy in informing us thus fully of the
                            decisions he had reached.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then went on to discuss the oil situation. He said that he
                            would have come in to see me earlier about this but he had been laid up
                            with grippe for a week and he now wanted to tell me that with regard to
                            the four points comprising the basis of the proposal Mr. Richberg<note n="27" xml:id="d627fn27">Danold Richberg, representing the oil
                                companies whose properties were expropriated.</note> was to make to
                            President Cárdenas, the first point, namely, complete operation of the
                            properties by the companies, could not be accepted <hi rend="italic">in
                                toto</hi> by the Mexican Government but that President Cárdenas
                            believed some form of agreement on this point could be found; with
                            regard to the second point, binding long-term contracts, the Mexican
                            Government was perfectly prepared to agree and would even agree to a
                            50-year basis for such contracts; but point three, compensation to the
                            companies for the losses suffered while the Government was in possession
                            of the properties, could not be agreed to upon the basis proposed,
                            although the difficulty might be evaded by stepping up the percentage of
                            profits to be obtained by the companies through the contracts or by
                            extending the term of the contracts beyond the period which would
                            otherwise be agreed upon; finally, with regard to point four, namely,
                            the inclusion of the contract in some official agreement between the
                            Government of Mexico and the Government of the United States such as a
                            commercial agreement, President Cárdenas had stated that he would first
                            have to know the wishes of the Government of the United States in this
                            regard but that he saw in principle no objection to this point.</p>
                        <p>President Cárdenas had insistently urged that Mr. Richberg come to Mexico
                            City before March 1st because he himself was taking one of his
                            periodical trips around the country starting March 6th. He had <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0677"/>asked the Ambassador to come to
                            Mexico a few days before Mr. Richberg was due to arrive and suggested
                            that the meeting place between the three of them might be at
                            Monterrey.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that he had had two or three talks on the
                            telephone in the past few days with Mr. Hurley<note n="28" xml:id="d627fn28">Patrick J. Hurley, representing the Sinclair Oil
                                Company.</note> and that he now understood that while Mr. Hurley
                            would be in Mexico at the same time as Mr. Richberg, the latter did not
                            desire to negotiate conjointly with Mr. Hurley but rather separately.
                            Mr. Hurley had told the Ambassador that while his proposal was along the
                            same lines as that of Mr. Richberg, it also comprised a suggestion that
                            the companies lend the Government of Mexico $100,000,000 of which
                            seventy or eighty million dollars would go into immediate improvements
                            of the oil properties and into the further exploitation of new
                            properties and the remainder would be utilized by the Government of
                            Mexico in its public works program.</p>

                            weekly call on Thursday at the Foreign Office I informed Minister
                                Hay<note n="29" xml:id="d628fn29">Eduardo Hay, Mexican Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</note> that Mr. Donald Richberg, representing the
                            companies whose oil properties were expropriated in March 1938, had
                            reached Mexico to open negotiations with the Mexican authorities looking
                            to some mutually satisfactory agreement. I took occasion to say that my
                            Government sincerely hoped that an adjustment between the oil companies
                            and the Mexican Government could be reached. General Hay said that was
                            also his earnest hope. He added that delay in negotiations did not lie
                            at the door of the Mexican Government, for immediately after the
                            expropriation he had told me that the Mexican Government wished to
                            confer with the representatives of the oil companies and was determined
                            to pay for the properties expropriated, and that President Cárdenas had
                            publicly and in all ways invited the companies to name representatives
                            with whom he could confer. He said he was glad that the negotiations
                            were to take place and he hoped for the best results. He indicated that
                            the conferences would take place at the Department of Hacienda. The
                            President from the beginning has acted through the Minister of
                                Hacienda<note n="30" xml:id="d628fn30">Eduardo Suárez.</note> in all

                            of the week, he will not engage in any conferences until next week.</p>

                        <p>78. President Cárdenas issued statement March 18th, in summary it was
                            that the Government of Mexico stated at the time of expropriation its
                            intention to indemnify justly said companies and later to endeavor to
                            find a way to satisfy interests of companies. That Richberg proposed a
                            plan of collaboration for the development of the industry the companies
                            contributing toward such association the amount of the indemnification
                            for their properties and also the new amount which they are disposed to
                            invest. The Government will direct the directive and administrative
                            functions conceding representation to the companies in proportion to
                            their investments which will be on a lesser scale than the investments
                            of the Government. The Government is in possession of data to fix the
                            valuation of the expropriated properties. The duration of the plan of
                            collaboration et cetera will be “once the companies accept the
                            principles and bases proposed by the Mexican Government”.</p>
                        <p>Associated Press wired full statement night of March 18.</p>
                        <p>President Cárdenas spoke today before some 40,000 people, a smaller crowd
                            than was expected. He spoke of the fundamental laws Mexico and touched
                            upon the reason for dispropriation of the oil companies and spoke of the
                            precedent they established in taking their fight to foreign courts. He
                            stated that the companies had recently assumed an entirely different
                            attitude. Spoke of the attacks upon the Government by its enemies saying
                            that he was endeavoring to save Mexico from the clutches of imperialism
                            and to grant freedom to Mexico’s workers. Referred to his statement of
                            March 18 saying that the companies had proposed a plan of collaboration
                            and briefly outlined it. There was no applause from the crowd during
                            this period of the speech.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that after a
                            stay of two weeks, in which he had a number of conferences with
                            President Cárdenas seeking an agreement with reference to the
                            expropriated petroleum properties, Mr. Donald Richberg returns to
                            Washington today. The period of his stay here was not conducive to
                            success in the negotiations, for it was during the week when the schools
                            and the petroleum syndicates, the Mexican Revolutionary Party, and
                            others staged a celebration commemorating the expropriation. In these
                            celebrations, while President Cárdenas was moderate in his utterances as
                            compared with the declarations of other speakers, they all stated that
                            no step backward would be taken and that the properties would not be
                            returned. President Cárdenas made a statement which the press
                            interpreted as conveying the impression that an agreement was in sight
                            by which the petroleum fields would be operated under the direction of
                            the Mexican Government. Immediately Mr. Richberg made a statement
                            correcting the impression created by saying that no agreement had been
                            reached in the conferences. (See my despatch 8256 of March 22,
                                1939.<note n="31" xml:id="d630fn31">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Richberg called to see me yesterday afternoon and gave me the
                            substance of the above and related at length his various conferences
                            with President Cárdenas. Without any optimism he expressed gratification
                            at certain advances in the negotiations. He stressed that, instead of
                            discussing the value of the properties expropriated, about which
                            agreement was out of the question, he had succeeded in turning the
                            discussion to methods and plans for operation, a certain percentage of
                            the profits to go to the companies and a certain proportion to the
                            Mexican Government. He hopes the management will be solely in the hands
                            of the oil companies, whereas the Mexicans think they should manage. If
                            a solution is reached Mr. Richberg, I think, expects both sides must
                            make some concessions. In case of agreement as to operation, the
                            question of percentage of profits will be next up for discussion. He
                            said he had not suggested any particular division, believing it most
                            important to secure an agreement on principle. If that is reached, both
                            sides might give such consideration to a just division as would lead to
                            an agreement.</p>
                        <p>President Cárdenas suggested that in case an accord could be reached the
                            oil companies ought to unite so that it could be possible to settle <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0680"/>everything between only two
                            parties. He thought the fact that there are now sixteen oil companies
                            under different management would militate against the success of the
                            best carrying out of the operations suggested by Mr. Richberg. The
                            answer of Mr. Richberg was that to amalgamate all the sixteen companies
                            would be involved with many difficulties and he would like to discuss
                            the proposal with the representatives of the oil companies. He said that
                            when he first made the suggestion they “went up in the air” and said it
                            was utterly impossible. However, a few days later they softened and he
                            told President Cárdenas it would involve many difficulties but he
                            believed it might be possible to include them in only four companies for
                            the purpose of acting with the Mexican authorities. He pointed out to me
                            that the companies concerned here were competitors and some of them
                            might prefer competitive instead of cooperative action.</p>
                        <p>“I am pleased”, said Mr. Richberg, “at the friendly spirit in the
                            negotiations and the evident desire of President Cárdenas to find a
                            solution. However, I am giving out rather pessimistic statements because
                            the early optimistic reports conveyed the impression that agreement was
                            near, which the situation did not justify. Also, if I spoke
                            optimistically, the Mexican Government might suppose I was ready to make
                            concessions and not feel it necessary to recede from some of its
                            positions. If I speak pessimistically, they will feel that concord is
                            possible only by mutual concessions.” He said that the very optimistic
                            statements in the press here had conveyed the impression, not justified,
                            that agreement was certainly in the offing, whereas there are more
                            hurdles ahead.</p>
                        <p>The fact that he is leaving Thursday has been variously interpreted. Some
                            of the American correspondents believe it signifies that the
                            negotiations have failed and that is why Mr. Richberg is going home now.
                            I told them that on the first day of his arrival, before he had even
                            seen the President, Mr. Richberg informed me that he was compelled to be
                            in Washington on the 26th or 27th of March to argue an important case.
                            He told me in his latest conversation that it would be necessary for him
                            to see officials of the oil companies in New York and to suggest some
                            reconsideration of matters that would aid in successful negotiations,
                            and that he could return here toward the end of April for further
                            discussions. He believes an agreement is not impossible and that the
                            groundwork has been laid which may end the impasse; but he appreciates
                            that it is not wise to be either too optimistic or too pessimistic.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Welles</hi>: Mr. Richberg called today and
                            informed Mr. Bursley and me at length concerning his recent negotiations
                            in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>As he left, he said he would furnish the Department, for its strictly
                            confidential information, a copy of the draft of his memorandum of his
                            understanding of the points on which he reached agreement with President
                            Cárdenas. A copy of this memo was presented to President Cárdenas for
                            his approval.</p>
                        <p>All the companies have agreed that the formula embodied in the memo to
                            President Cárdenas is a satisfactory basis for the detailed discussions.
                            Although some changes have been suggested, Mr. Richberg has been able to
                            keep the companies in line by holding out the possibility of securing
                            President Cárdenas’ word that he also is prepared to go ahead without
                            changes. The longer time goes on with no word from Mexico, the more
                            difficult it will be to prevent the companies, which are continuing to
                            mull over the memo, from suggesting <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0682"/>modifications. He thought that he would have difficulty
                            in holding the companies in line for more than a week longer.</p>
                        <p>He said that it would be very helpful if some intimation could reach
                            President Cárdenas of his difficulty in keeping the companies toeing the
                            mark as well as if the suggestion could be made that it would be highly
                            desirable were President Cárdenas within the next few days to inform him
                            that the basis of agreement as set forth in the memorandum had been
                            accepted by Mexico. With this information he would decline to receive
                            any suggested changes in the bases from the companies, Mr. Richberg said
                            he had understood that President Cárdenas was to have conveyed such an
                            acceptance some days ago and that he now thought the Mexicans were
                            holding off waiting to see whether the companies would take the next
                            step.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Richberg that I thought you would be willing to have a
                            personal chat with Ambassador Castillo Nájera about this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Richberg also stated that the Mexican Government desired to have the
                            settlement, if reached, embodied in a treaty. He expressed the opinion
                            that such a treaty would not encounter serious opposition in the United
                            States Senate. There is attached for convenient reference a copy of the
                                memorandum<note n="35" xml:id="d632fn35">Not printed.</note> of my
                            conversation on April 29, 1939, with the Counselor of the British
                            Embassy on this aspect of the matter. This recites briefly the possible
                            advantages and disadvantages of the treaty method. One of the principal
                            difficulties foreseen was that the Mexican Government would not agree.
                            In the light of Mr. Richberg’s statement this might not be the case.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Duggan</hi>: After our conversation Tuesday
                            Mr. Bursley stated that you would like very much to have a copy of the
                                Memorandum<note n="35" xml:id="d633fn35">Not printed.</note> to
                            which I referred, which was prepared during the recent conferences with
                            President Cárdenas.</p>
                        <p>We have been very careful to keep this material confidential, because of
                            the possibility that it might be published, which would embarrass the
                            negotiations, and particularly because it might be publicized as a
                            proposition from one party to another, or as a practical agreement,
                            when, in fact, all concerned have reserved judgment and avoided any
                            definite commitment; although the document expresses <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0683"/>many propositions as to which there is
                            apparently substantial agreement.</p>
                        <p>As I stated to you, if both sides can avoid insistence on troublesome
                            modifications of language, or any radical change in the underlying
                            ideas, the basis for detailed negotiations may be quickly found. I am
                            fearful that delay and further discussions will simply provide an
                            opportunity for obstructionists to increase the obstacles to
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Under Secretary may have a conference on
                            this matter tomorrow, I thought he should have an opportunity to
                            familiarize himself with this Memorandum; although he may or may not
                            think it advisable to give evidence of having such knowledge.</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called to see me this morning.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Ambassador that I had understood from my last conversation
                            with him that President Cárdenas did not intend to consult with other
                            members of his Government with regard to the basis for agreement
                            proposed by Mr. Richberg at Saltillo and that the Ambassador was waiting
                            to hear from Mr. Richberg what the attitude of the companies might be. I
                            told the Ambassador that I did not know whether Mr. Richberg had as yet
                            anything to say to him in that regard, but that I had gathered from Mr.
                            Richberg that he understood that the Ambassador was to inform him what
                            the attitude of President Cárdenas might be. I said that if any
                            misunderstanding existed, I wanted to be as helpful as possible in
                            clearing it up and that it seemed to me very desirable that the very
                            useful and agreeable contact which had existed between the Ambassador
                            and Mr. Richberg should neither be broken nor suspended. I said it
                            seemed to me that if any delay of an inordinate character now took
                            place, those in Mexico opposed to the reaching of an agreement would be
                            given time in which to try and stir up public opinion against a
                            reasonable agreement, and in the same way such individuals within the
                            oil companies as might be disposed to take a view of complete
                            intransigence in the negotiation of a settlement might be given
                            additional time in which to make their views prevail. Furthermore, I
                            added, if the press and public opinion in this country were given to
                            understand that the Ambassador and Mr. Richberg were not even talking
                            with one another, we would probably soon see stories published alleging
                            that negotiations had broken down, and I told the Ambassador, as I had
                            said so often before, that public opinion in the United States was
                            getting <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0684"/>very much aroused about
                            this problem and I felt any indication of this character would probably
                            be sufficient to call forth a series of articles once more attacking the
                            Mexican Government and creating an atmosphere in which friendly and
                            reasonable negotiations might be difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me that he confirmed what he had previously said,
                            namely, that President Cárdenas did not intend to discuss the basis
                            proposed with any one else, but would make up his own mind with regard
                            thereto. He said that General Cárdenas had telegraphed him a couple of
                            days ago saying that during the next few days he would be travelling in
                            the desert regions in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora where there
                            were no telephonic or telegraphic communications and that it would not
                            be until May 24 that he would reach Hermosillo from which place he would
                            write to the Ambassador his definite conclusions. In the meantime, the
                            Ambassador said he would be very pleased to have the opportunity of
                            talking over the situation with Mr. Richberg and he agreed with me that
                            conversations would be useful and desirable. The Ambassador said that
                            some new ideas as to handling some of the points had occurred to him and
                            he expressed the very definite considered opinion that none of the
                            points in the basis as proposed by Mr. Richberg would present any
                            obstacle other than the point covering management. He said that public
                            opinion in Mexico, when the basis had recently been made public, had
                            almost unanimously protested against the plan for management, alleging
                            that this was merely a device for returning to the companies the
                            complete and exclusive control of the properties. He said that he did
                            not think President Cárdenas could stand up against this hostility.</p>
                        <p>I insisted, however, that in my own judgment the basis provided a
                            reasonable, equitable, and fair means of adjustment and that it seemed
                            to me that all that was now required was ingenuity and good will in
                            developing formulas. I told the Ambassador I would be glad to
                            communicate to Mr. Richberg the message he had given me.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Mallet, Counselor of the British Embassy, called this afternoon and
                            referred to previous conversations he has had in the Department with
                            regard to the possibility of confirmation by a treaty (or exchange <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0685"/>of notes) of any arrangement
                            effected between the Mexican Government and the oil companies for a
                            settlement of the present controversy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet said that the British companies had furnished the Foreign
                            Office with a copy of the memorandum Mr. Richberg had left with
                            President Cárdenas early this month and that, according to the fourth
                            section of that memorandum, Mr. Richberg had suggested the possibility
                            of such an agreement between the countries and had definitely referred
                            to the possible negotiation of a commercial treaty between Mexico and
                            the United States which would enable mutual protection for the nationals
                            of each country and their properties in the other, and give assurances
                            of continuing improved relations between each Government and citizens of
                            the other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet said that if the Department could do so, he would appreciate
                            it if the Department would inform him whether it would be disposed to
                            sign a treaty or exchange notes with Mexico giving recognition to any
                            solution which may be reached of the oil controversy and whether this
                            Government would be inclined also to negotiate a treaty with Mexico
                            looking to the mutual protection of the citizens and property of one in
                            the territory of the other. He said that he thought his Government would
                            desire to take a similar course to ours.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Mallet that I did not know whether the Department had taken a
                            decision with respect to these matters, but that with regard to the
                            question of a treaty or exchange of notes to give greater force to a
                            solution of the oil controversy, it was my personal assumption that it
                            had not been considered particularly likely Mexico would agree to such
                            an arrangement and for this reason other aspects of the matter had not
                            been fully explored.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mallet said he was leaving Washington and would return on Thursday,
                            at which time he would inquire whether there was any information I could
                            furnish him regarding these matters.</p>
                        <p>In view of the pledge of secrecy with which Mr. Richberg furnished us a
                            copy of his memorandum, I did not give any indication that we had a copy
                            of it. With reference to the Mexican attitude towards a possible treaty
                            or exchange of notes to implement the oil agreement, if reached, I refer
                            to the last paragraph on page 2 of RA’s memorandum of May 16, 1939,
                            stating:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the last paragraph of memorandum printed on <ref target="#pg_673">page 673</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate instructions as to whether the Department desires me
                            to convey any expression of views to Mr. Mallet.</p>
                        <p>I may add that it would seem likely, in the event an agreement for the
                            mutual protection of citizens and property is agreed to by Mexico, that
                            Mexico also would want a trade agreement granting reduced import duties
                            on vegetables, petroleum products, and perhaps other products.</p>

                        <p>Your consideration is called to the attached memorandum<note n="39" xml:id="d636fn39">
                        <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> of
                            conversation with Mr. Mallet, Counselor of the British Embassy,
                            regarding the confirmation by treaty or exchange of notes of any
                            agreement effected between the Mexican Government and the oil companies
                            for a settlement of the present controversy.</p>
                        <p>The embodiment of any eventual agreement in a treaty has both advantages
                            and disadvantages. It would undoubtedly give the agreement more prestige
                            and stability. It would, however, result in this Government being
                            inevitably drawn into numerous conflicts which are bound to arise even
                            with the best faith on both sides. Whenever the companies thought that
                            the Mexican Government did not comply with the agreement they would
                            appeal to this Government that the treaty had been violated, with the
                            result that this Department would be placed in an extremely difficult
                            position. Were it to give ear to these complaints it would have to
                            establish a special section of experts to investigate in order to
                            determine whether the complaints of the companies were justifiable.</p>
                        <p>The situation that might obtain between the Mexican Government and the
                            petroleum companies in Mexico, which are privately owned, is entirely
                            different from that existing between the Iranian Government and the
                            Anglo-Persian Company, which I understand is controlled by the British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In private conversation Mr. Richberg has mentioned as the period of the
                            agreement between the companies and the Mexican Government fifty years,
                            so that were the arrangement to be confirmed in a treaty this Department
                            would be concerned for fifty years with the observance of the terms of
                            that treaty.</p>
                        <p>In considering the desirability of confirming the arrangement by a treaty
                            the suggestion is made that there be considered at the same time the
                            possibility of the Mexican Government exchanging notes with this
                            Government, and possibly the British and Dutch Governments, in which the
                            two Governments would take cognizance of the arrangement arrived at and
                            expressing satisfaction thereof. In this way the several governments
                            would take recognition of the agreement but would not become involved in
                            its observance in every detail by becoming parties to a treaty or
                            treaties.</p>
                        <p>It is my suggestion that Mr. Mallet be informed when he calls on <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0687"/>Thursday that the Department is
                            giving consideration to the matter but has arrived at no conclusion.</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called this morning at my request. After taking up
                            with the Ambassador the Compañía Hidroeléctrica Potosina case, I asked
                            the Ambassador to tell me what the latest developments might be with
                            regard to the oil controversy.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Mr. Richberg had come in to see him very
                            hurriedly a few days ago but without any communication to make to him
                            other than to suggest that the Ambassador and he issue a joint statement
                            declaring that the general bases for agreement had now been agreed upon
                            by the President of Mexico and by the companies and that in consequence
                            thereof the formulation of detailed plans as to the method of carrying
                            out this agreement was to be placed immediately in the hands of experts
                            selected by both sides. The Ambassador told me that he had replied that
                            while he was willing to draft such a statement for the consideration of
                            President Cárdenas, he thought that in as much as President Cárdenas had
                            not yet given his consent to the plan for agreement proposed it would
                            only complicate matters to send President Cárdenas such a draft
                            statement. He said that President Cárdenas had telegraphed him today
                            that he was communicating his decisions to the Ambassador by mail and
                            the Ambassador said the letter containing these instructions would
                            probably not reach him before the end of the present week. The
                            Ambassador said that he was worried by the delay, and regarded as a bad
                            sign the fact that there had now joined President Cárdenas at Hermosillo
                            not only Beteta<note n="40" xml:id="d637fn40">Ramón Beteta, Mexican
                                Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</note> and one or two oil
                            experts of the Mexican Government, but also the Mexican Secretary of the
                            Treasury, Señor Suárez. The Ambassador seemed to be pessimistic as to
                            the outlook.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I trusted Señor Beteta would repeat to
                            President Cárdenas what I had said to him, namely, that President
                            Roosevelt and this Government believed the bases for settlement proposed
                            were entirely equitable and fair to both sides and that it seemed to me
                            imperative that an agreement be reached at the earliest possible moment
                            in order to prevent further delay giving aid and comfort <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0688"/>to those in both countries opposed to
                            the reaching of any agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he also hoped that Beteta had repeated this to
                            President Cárdenas, but that all that Beteta had said to him of his
                            conversation with me was that I had urged a rapid agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador also talked at some length with regard to the visit he had
                            had recently in New York from Mr. Patrick J. Hurley. He said that Mr.
                            Hurley had given him to understand that his company had been informed by
                            Mr. Richberg that President Cárdenas had already given his full
                            agreement to the bases of settlement proposed. The Ambassador told him
                            that this was not the fact and that while he personally believed all of
                            the bases proposed would be satisfactory to President Cárdenas with the
                            exception of that portion of the agreement providing for administration
                            of the properties, he had no reason to think that President Cárdenas
                            would agree to this particular provision. The Ambassador said that Mr.
                            Hurley had then again brought up the question of the Sinclair group
                            making a direct agreement with the Mexican Government even if the other
                            companies did not fall in line. The Ambassador said that he had again
                            thrown cold water on this suggestion and had emphatically stated to Mr.
                            Hurley that he believed it to be in the interest of both sides that all
                            of the companies reach agreement conjointly and not separately. The
                            Ambassador told me he had gained the impression that Mr. Hurley was
                            completely in the dark as to what the situation might be and was merely
                            trying to find out from the Ambassador what the actual facts might
                            be.</p>

                        <p>After luncheon at the Mexican Embassy on Saturday I had the opportunity
                            of a few moments conversation with Señor Beteta.</p>
                        <p>I told Sr. Beteta that he knew of the very great importance which this
                            Government attached to the settlement of the petroleum controversy and
                            inquired whether there was anything that he could tell me regarding the
                            recent developments.</p>
                        <p>Señor Beteta stated that the negotiations were not making progress
                            because the petroleum companies were taking too rigid and resilient a
                            position. He went on to explain that in his opinion there were two
                            principal obstacles. The first of these had to do with the relationship
                            between the Government and the companies in the management of <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0689"/>the properties under the
                            proposal suggested by Mr. Richberg; the second had to do with the
                            evaluation of the properties which was necessary to determine the share
                            which the companies should receive from the profits of operation.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the first of these difficulties, he stated that it was
                            politically impossible for the Mexican Government to agree that a
                            foreigner should be the head of the administrative agency or that
                            foreigners should have a majority on the board of representation of the
                            agency. He stated that the Government was willing to give them minority
                            participation and a substantial degree of technical supervision, but
                            that it was not willing to give control of the management to the
                            companies.</p>
                        <p>Without undertaking to argue the point I asked Mr. Beteta whether he
                            thought that under these conditions the companies would invest the new
                            capital necessary not only to keep the present properties in shape, but
                            to develop the petroleum industry as the Mexican Government desired. Sr.
                            Beteta said that from the companies’ point of view he could see
                            objection to the management formula suggested by the Government, but
                            reiterated that it was a political impossibility for the Government to
                            return control of management to the companies.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second difficulty, the appraisal of the value of the
                            expropriated property, Sr. Beteta said that in his opinion this was a
                            greater obstacle than the first, although there had been no discussion
                            of it. He said that he did not understand how there could be any
                            division of the net income of the proposed new company between the
                            present companies and the Government if there was not some determination
                            in advance of the amount of contribution of each to the new company. He
                            thought that the appraisal of the value of the machinery, et cetera,
                            would not present any great obstacle but that the difficulty would come
                            in connection with the sub-soil resources. In this connection he
                            mentioned that the Constitution of 1917 provided that the sub-soil
                            resources vested in the Government. I reminded him that while this was
                            correct it was my understanding that the Mexican Government had
                            recognized that this provision of the Mexican Constitution was not
                            applicable to concessions granted prior to 1917 and that most of the
                            concessions which had been expropriated under the decree of March 18,
                            1938 were those entered into prior to 1917. Sr. Beteta stated that this
                            had been the position of previous Mexican administrations but that it
                            might not be the position maintained by the present administration
                            should this aspect of the matter come to the forefront of the
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Beteta then said he would like to tell me frankly that Mr. Richberg
                            was making it appear that this Government considered his <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0690"/>proposal the only one susceptible of
                            solving the petroleum controversy. I told Sr. Beteta that while I did
                            not think that the President or the Secretary would wish to take the
                            position that Mr. Richberg’s proposal was the only one for settling the
                            controversy, nevertheless it seemed to present the basis of an agreement
                            which accounted for this Government’s hope that the arrangement
                            suggested be given the most careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Beteta replied that his Government thought that there were
                            alternative proposals and had so indicated in the memorandum handed to
                            Mr. Richberg. At this point I told Sr. Beteta that if he had reference
                            to the payment of cash compensation to the companies I felt sure that he
                            would agree with me that this would only be possible in case Mexico
                            could borrow the money in the United States. I said that I thought I
                            should tell him in all frankness that that was a vain delusion if indeed
                            it was entertained seriously by the Mexican Government since I knew of
                            no responsible bank that would undertake to loan money for that purpose.
                            I started to say that if the Mexican Government thought that it could
                            secure the money from W. E. Davis, it would find itself sadly mistaken.
                            …</p>
                        <p>Señor Beteta said that he had been sent up here by President Cárdenas to
                            find out what the “atmosphere” in Washington was. He told me that he had
                            gathered from the press that the “atmosphere” was very bad; and then
                            asked me whether that was correct. I told Sr. Beteta that I thought the
                            press in Washington, which was usually well informed, had properly
                            diagnosed the trend of thought. I said that the President and the
                            Secretary were very concerned at the present status of the negotiations
                            between Richberg and the Mexican Government; they had handled the oil
                            situation from the day it occurred with the greatest deftness in an
                            endeavor not to permit it to cast a blot over relations between the
                            United States and Mexico; that they had assumed, on the basis of what
                            President Cárdenas had publicly stated, that the Mexican Government
                            intended to make good on the statements that it intended to make
                            compensation; that they had been waiting for well over a year, but that
                            it was only within the last few months that there had been any real
                            effort to come to an agreement; that now that effort appeared on the
                            verge of a breakdown so that naturally they were very much concerned. I
                            stated that fortunately public opinion was not blazing forth in
                            headlines against Mexico, but that there was a strong undercurrent of
                            rising feeling against Mexico’s failure to make a really constructive
                            effort to come to an agreement. I said that I assumed that it was no
                            news to him that the companies if unable to secure an agreement under
                            this administration, would throw all their power, which was
                            considerable, behind whatever presidential candidate in the 1940
                            elections they <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0691"/>thought would
                            bring about a settlement I told him that without attempting to forecast
                            the result of elections in 1940, if an opposing administration were to
                            come into office a different policy might be pursued by the United
                            States. Sr. Beteta, after taking objection to my statement about
                            Mexico’s not having made a constructive effort to reach an agreement,
                            went on to state that he recognized that the United States had within
                            its power means of compelling Mexico to do whatever it wanted, even to
                            the extent of requiring the return of the properties to the companies. I
                            broke in here to state that this Government had, as he knew, never made
                            any such request, but again, as he knew, had looked with some favor upon
                            a cooperative management and sales plan under which the Mexican
                            Government would retain the properties. Sr. Beteta continued that be
                            that as it might, if the United States Government wanted Mexico to
                            follow any particular line of action it could compel her to, but that
                            this would mean the overthrow of the Cárdenas regime in Mexico,
                            political and social chaos, probably continued civil strife, and very
                            definite antagonism between the United States and Mexico; moreover, it
                            would mean the end of the good neighbor policy, which would be
                            completely unmasked as nothing more than crude imperialism. He added
                            significantly that Mexico would take the steps to see that this was
                            done.</p>
                        <p>Señor Beteta said that he regretted it had become known by the press that
                            the United States Government was considering “taking strong action”
                            against Mexico. I said that I did not think that the press had any idea
                            of what measures the United States might be contemplating and that I
                            wanted to make it clear to him that so far this Government had taken not
                            a single means of pressure to bring Mexico to an agreement.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of Mexico called to see me this afternoon. He told me that
                            his two conversations with Mr. Richberg of June 18 and June 19 had been
                            on the whole satisfactory. He said that in his conversation with Mr.
                            Richberg yesterday he had agreed to omit the question of valuation in
                            the bases of agreement and that Mr. Richberg had agreed to suggestions
                            that the Ambassador had made whereby the Mexican Government would have a
                            majority on the <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0692"/>Board of
                            Directors of the proposed new Mexican corporation to handle the oil
                            properties, and that, without stating anything specific with regard to
                            the nationality of the new manager, the selection of the new manager
                            would be left to the determination of the Board of Directors. The
                            Ambassador mentioned various other amendments which he had suggested
                            with reference to the administration of the properties which had been
                            accepted in principle by Mr. Richberg. The Ambassador believed that this
                            memorandum would be supported by Beteta and would be accepted by
                            President Cárdenas.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, however, was very much perturbed because in the covering
                            letter which Mr. Richberg had sent him this afternoon conveying the
                            final text of the memorandum which they had both agreed upon yesterday
                            afternoon, Mr. Richberg had referred to the memorandum as the
                            Ambassador’s own proposal. The Ambassador said it was absolutely
                            impossible for him to agree to this since in the first place his
                            Government had not authorized him to make what was tantamount to a new
                            proposal; and that he saw no reason why either he, or Mr. Richberg, or
                            the companies, or the Mexican Government should assume the paternity of
                            this proposal and that, in his judgment, the only solution was for the
                            memorandum to be regarded as an exchange of views between Mr. Richberg
                            and himself for submission to the Government and to the companies. I
                            told the Ambassador that I was in entire accord with his point of view,
                            and that it seemed to me that this question was one which could readily
                            be solved.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon called up Mr. Richberg on the telephone and explained the
                            matter to him, and Mr. Richberg said he was quite willing to withdraw
                            his covering letter of today and to let the memorandum stand as it had
                            been before. He said he would get in touch with the Mexican Ambassador.
                            Subsequently the Ambassador called me on the telephone and told me he
                            had spoken with Mr. Richberg and Mr. Richberg had told him that he was
                            quite willing to leave the memorandum without any covering letter, and
                            that if the bases contained in the memorandum were acceptable to the
                            Mexican Government and the companies, both sides could then take joint
                            responsibility for it.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that consequently he would leave early tomorrow
                            morning to join President Cárdenas in Lower California, and that he was
                            now for the first time really optimistic that an agreement in principle
                            had been found. I expressed to him my very great satisfaction and my
                            more than earnest hope that there would be no further delays and that he
                            could notify me within the next few days that the basis now proposed is
                            acceptable to his Government.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 8561 of May 20, 1939,<note n="43" xml:id="d640fn43">Not

                            taking inventories of the properties of the petroleum companies.</p>
                        <p>In the despatch under reference it was pointed out that the taking of
                            inventories had apparently been dropped. Somewhat previous to this time,
                            on February 20, 1939, to be exact, attorneys for affiliates of the
                            Standard of New Jersey which had not been named in the expropriation
                            decree entered an <hi rend="italic">amparo</hi> suit against the action
                            of the Government: the grounds for the complaint that the Government had
                            proceeded with taking the inventories and evaluating the properties of
                            these non-expropriated, although seized, companies.</p>
                        <p>On June 13, 1939, a decision was rendered by the Second Section of the
                            Supreme Court dismissing <hi rend="italic">amparo</hi> proceedings.
                            Copies of the decision of the Supreme Court, as well as translations
                                thereof,<note n="43" xml:id="d640fn1">Not printed.</note> are
                            transmitted herewith.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on the decision, the representatives of the Standard Oil

                                brought by the Cía. Petrolera Franco Española, an affiliate of the

                                18, 1939, respectively, on the ground that the companies had not had

                        <p>I told Dr. Quintanilla<note n="47" xml:id="d641fn47">Luis Quintanilla,
                                Mexican Chargé.</note> that the second matter I wished to discuss
                            with him was the very serious situation which I feared was now
                            developing as the result of the last communication sent to Mr. Richberg
                            by the Mexican Ambassador and by reason of a reply sent to the
                            Ambassador by Mr. Richberg. Dr. Quintanilla said he was not informed of
                            the nature of the reply sent by Mr. Richberg and that he had only seen
                            the press references thereto. I explained to Dr. Quintanilla in some
                            detail that Mr. Richberg and the companies by which he was retained had
                            reached the very definite conclusion that the bases for settlement set
                            forth in the Ambassador’s last letter departed completely from the
                            general bases agreed upon between the Ambassador and Mr. Richberg and
                            likewise brought into the scope of the proposed agreement elements which
                            would be totally unacceptable to the companies. I said that while I was
                            in no position to discuss details of the negotiations nor at this stage
                            to express any opinion as to the merits of the points insisted upon by
                            the companies, I, nevertheless, after talking with Mr. Richberg,
                            obtained the impression that the bases proposed in the Ambassador’s last
                            letter did in fact depart very materially from the point of view which
                            had always been expressed to me by Mr. Richberg and which had been
                            confirmed to me in our conversations by the Ambassador himself.</p>
                        <p>I said that I was sure Dr. Quintanilla would understand that if the
                            present negotiations were now completely to break down, this Government
                            could no longer remain out of the picture and that although we had over
                            a period of 18 months hoped that negotiations between Mexico and the
                            companies would prove successful and had time and again done everything
                            we could to facilitate the course of these negotiations, it was quite
                            impossible for the United States Government indefinitely to refrain from
                            undertaking to interpose its support in behalf of what we regarded as
                            the legitimate and well-founded complaint on the part of nationals of
                            the United States that the Mexican Government had seized their
                            properties, was utilizing <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0695"/>the
                            properties to Mexico’s own benefit, and was making no effective effort
                            whatever to offer fair and adequate compensation to the individuals
                            whose properties had been confiscated. Furthermore, I said that I had
                            been informed that the companies, believing that all hope of a
                            successful conclusion of the negotiations must now be abandoned, were
                            preparing to issue a public statement to the American public setting
                            forth the complete history of the incident itself and of the
                            negotiations which had subsequently taken place and of the reasons why
                            they felt it impossible to continue these negotiations. I said that, of
                            course, if this statement were issued a very serious situation would be
                            presented which would be one which I was sure would be exceedingly
                            unsatisfactory both to the Governments of Mexico and to the United
                            States. I said that I thought this statement would not be published
                            until it was ascertained by the companies what the nature of the
                            attitude of the Mexican Government might be with regard to the points
                            set forth in Mr. Richberg’s last letter and that I felt quite confident
                            that the publication of this statement would not be long withheld. I
                            said, therefore, that it seemed to me that the situation is exceedingly
                            urgent and that I trusted Dr. Quintanilla would communicate immediately
                            with the Ambassador and apprise the latter of the very great concern
                            which I felt, as well as of my most earnest hope that upon further
                            consideration the Mexican Government would find it possible to attain an
                            agreement with Mr. Richberg as to the general bases for negotiation,
                            without which, he felt satisfied, no further negotiation would usefully
                            be undertaken. I said that Dr. Quintanilla could not emphasize too
                            strongly the very great disquiet which I felt.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the termination of our interview Dr. Quintanilla called me
                            on the telephone from the Embassy to inform me that he had tried to get
                            in touch with Dr. Castillo Nájera in Mazatlan but he had learned that
                            the Ambassador had already left the latter city, intending to arrive in
                            Mexico City tomorrow. In order to save time Dr. Quintanilla called up
                            his Foreign Minister on the telephone and had urged him to see that the
                            letter which Mr. Richberg had mailed to the Ambassador in care of the
                            Foreign Office and which should have reached the Foreign Office, be
                            placed in the hands of the Ambassador at the first possible moment so
                            that he might consider it and discuss it with President Cárdenas before
                            they both reach Mexico City. Dr. Quintanilla told me that he would
                            without fail telephone Dr. Castillo Nájera tomorrow and would
                            communicate with me immediately thereafter.</p>

                        <p>After consultation with the President, and after receiving his approval,
                            I had separate conversations with both the Mexican Ambassador and with
                            Mr. Donald Richberg with regard to the oil negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I reiterated to the Ambassador the statements made to him at the White
                            House yesterday by the President, particularly emphasizing the
                            President’s belief that if the Mexican Government did not now after this
                            very long delay reach an equitable adjustment of the controversy with
                            the American companies, public opinion in this country would be so
                            incensed as to bring about a situation in which the Congress would
                            undoubtedly enact legislation making it impossible for the Executive in
                            the future to purchase Mexican silver. The Ambassador told me that he
                            had already communicated in great detail to President Cárdenas the
                            statements made by the President. I said that it seemed to me that the
                            crux of the situation lay in point one of the counter proposals which
                            Mr. Richberg was to receive from the Ambassador this afternoon, namely,
                            the insistence of the Mexican Government that the boards of directors of
                            the four corporations to be set up be composed in each instance in their
                            majority of Mexican nationals appointed by the Mexican Government, and
                            that the operation of the oil properties consequently be under the sole
                            control and jurisdiction of the Mexican Government. I said it was clear
                            that the companies could not and would not agree to this provision. I
                            said I recognized fully from what the Mexican Government had stated to
                            us that public opinion in Mexico and the official statements of the
                            President of Mexico made it impossible for the Mexican Government to
                            recede from the position it had taken and to return to the American
                            companies the operation of the properties in question, either directly
                            or in some disguised form. It appeared to me, I said, that the time had
                            now come for a definite determination of whether a reasonable and fair
                            solution of this problem could not be found, and in that spirit I was
                            authorized by the President to make the following suggestion:</p>
                        <p>The formula proposed was for each of the four boards of directors to be
                            composed of nine individuals, three to be appointed by the Mexican
                            Government and three by the American companies; and the remaining three
                            directors to be selected in the following manner: the Government of
                            Mexico and the Government of the United States will agree upon a list of
                            nine individuals to be nationals of neither Mexico, the United States,
                            Great Britain, nor the Netherlands and all to be persons of demonstrated
                            integrity and standing, and of experience <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0697"/>either in commerce, in finance, or in the oil industry;
                            the six members of the boards of directors appointed as indicated above
                            would be obligated to select from the list agreed upon by the two
                            governments, within a period of thirty days after the handing to them of
                            the list in question, three individuals who would constitute the three
                            remaining members of the boards of directors. I stated that in
                            proffering this suggestion it seemed to me that if accepted it would
                            enable the Mexican Government to maintain the position it had taken,
                            since the control and management of the properties would not be returned
                            to the American companies, while at the same time it would remove the
                            objection on the part of the companies as expressed to me that the
                            Mexican proposal envisaged complete control by the Mexican Government of
                            management and operation, to which the companies could not agree.</p>
                        <p>I said that I further suggested that should this proposal be regarded
                            favorably by the Mexican Government and the companies it might be
                            regarded as a solution of a temporary character, say for a two or
                            three-year period, with the hope that once operations had commenced
                            under the plan so proposed, the Mexican Government and the companies by
                            common accord could agree upon a permanent solution.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that at first glance he could see no reason why this
                            should not be a way out of the difficulty and that he would at once
                            submit it to his Government with the hope that they might accept it.</p>
                        <p>In my interview with Mr. Richberg I submitted the same formula to him and
                            likewise stated to him that I did so by specific authorization from the
                            President. Mr. Richberg went into the matter very fully, but seemed to
                            me to be laboring very definitely under the belief that the American
                            companies whom he represented felt that the time had come when
                            negotiations with the Mexican Government would ho longer be productive
                            of any useful purpose and that the companies would favor the issuance of
                            a statement to the public giving the entire history of the negotiations
                            with the Mexican Government and stating that they had terminated because
                            of the inability of the companies to agree with the Mexican Government
                            upon any basis of settlement.</p>
                        <p>I said that it seemed to me that if this were the case the companies
                            ought to recognize certain facts very clearly. I said that it was
                            already rumored in Mexico in many quarters that the companies were
                            unwilling to reach any agreement with the Cárdenas Government, hoping
                            that General Almazán would be elected President of Mexico and that they
                            could make a deal with him whereby control and management of their
                            properties would be restored to them. I said that if the companies now
                            publicly announced termination of the negotiations this belief in Mexico
                            would be very generally strengthened and that <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0698"/>the whole oil controversy would become
                            the foremost issue in the campaign and that it undoubtedly would be
                            charged in many quarters that General Almazán had “sold out” to the
                            companies and that the companies were mixing directly in Mexican
                            political affairs. I said that the inauguration of the next president of
                            Mexico was in any event still 18 months off, as the next president would
                            not take office until January 1941, and that in the meantime the
                            controversy which would arise during the political campaign would
                            prejudice, in my judgment, not only every American interest in Mexico,
                            but also very definitely relations between the two countries. I further
                            said, what assurance could the companies have that the next president of
                            Mexico would in fact be inclined to favor their point of view; and if
                            some president of Mexico not favorable to their point of view took
                            office after the very bitter campaign which would undoubtedly be
                            engendered, the companies would in that event be as badly off, if not
                            worse off, than they are now.</p>
                        <p>So far as the situation in this country was concerned, I said I felt Mr.
                            Richberg was fully aware of the fact that this question might, of
                            course, become a political issue in the United States as well as in
                            Mexico. For all of these reasons I believed, therefore, that it was very
                            desirable that the companies should exercise the utmost amount of
                            patience in the present negotiations and should not close the doors
                            until every effort had been made to try and find an equitable solution
                            which would give them the guarantees they felt were indispensable but
                            which at the same time might prevent the issue from becoming one of a
                            violent, political nature in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Richberg said that he would go to see the Mexican Ambassador
                            immediately after leaving me and that he would then telephone his
                            principals who are not in Washington. He also said he would probably
                            have to attend a joint meeting of the heads of all of the companies in
                            New York within the next two days and that he would see me again either
                            this evening or tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am addressing you in
                            behalf of American interests represented by Mr. Donald E. Richberg in
                            recent negotiations with the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>Ever since the forcible seizure of foreign owned oil properties by the
                            Mexican Government on March 18, 1938, the owners of these properties <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0699"/>have protested the illegality
                            of this seizure. The American, British and Dutch Governments have all
                            made clear to the Mexican Government in separate but harmonious protests
                            that such a taking of private property without making prompt, assured
                            and adequate compensation to the owner is simply confiscation and cannot
                            be justified as a legal expropriation, under established principles of
                            international law, or indeed, even under Mexican law.</p>
                        <p>More than sixteen months have passed during which the Mexican Government
                            has furnished ample and convincing evidence not only of its inability,
                            but also of its unwillingness to make any genuine compensation for the
                            properties taken. Even its intermittent assertions of an intention
                            eventually to offer long deferred, inadequate and uncertain payments,
                            have been coupled with qualifications and counterclaims so absurd as to
                            make the assertions a mockery instead of a promise of justice.</p>
                        <p>The oil companies, on the other hand, have faced the realities of the
                            situation and have recognized the political and economic difficulties
                            embarrassing the Mexican Government. Without waiving their legal rights
                            they have sought to find a method of amicable settlement through which
                            the Mexican Government might achieve honorably its aims in regard to the
                            oil industry and might advance the welfare of its people in the
                            effective development of Mexican oil resources.</p>
                        <p>A practical program was developed late in the year 1938. The objectives
                            of negotiations were stated, and were accepted by the companies and the
                            Mexican Government, with the full knowledge and approval of the
                            Department of State of the United States. The five stated objectives
                            read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            underlie the proposed long term contracts in conformity with the
                            foregoing objectives. But when it appeared that a substantial agreement
                            upon major principles had been reached tentatively in Saltillo on May 3,
                            and that an expert negotiation of the detailed provisions of contracts
                            would be next in order and should be undertaken at an early date, a
                            sudden change took place in the attitude of the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>After a long and unexplained delay, and then a patient resumption of
                            discussions with the Mexican Ambassador in Washington, a letter was
                            received by Mr. Richberg on July 11 (dated July 5) setting forth the
                            position of the Mexican Government in such a way as to nullify the
                            results of the previous negotiations. Whereupon Mr. Richberg wrote to
                            the Mexican Ambassador on July 17 stating his conclusion that since the
                            efforts previously made to arrive at an understanding had been
                            abandoned, further negotiations appeared to be useless. A copy of this
                            letter, which is hereto attached, was transmitted promptly to the
                            Department of State of the United States as an explanation of the
                            breakdown of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>As the result of subsequent discussions between the State Department and
                            the Mexican Ambassador Mr. Richberg was advised that the Mexican
                            Government had under consideration a new proposition which the companies
                            would be asked to consider in the near future. While courteously waiting
                            this development the oil companies and Mr. Richberg have been surprised
                            to read articles in the newspapers purporting to reveal proposals
                            supposedly proceeding in part from Mr. Richberg, which neither he nor
                            his clients have ever made or would consider making.</p>
                        <p>It seems therefore necessary to state quite plainly that the oil
                            companies have not authorized, nor has Mr. Richberg undertaken, the
                            discussion in their behalf of any proposal which does not conform to the
                            objectives originally written as the basis for the discussions between
                            Mr. Richberg and the Mexican Government. Nor has anything happened since
                            the letter of Mr. Richberg, dated July 17, which would change the
                            conclusion stated therein.</p>
                        <p>It becomes necessary accordingly, to report to the Department of State of
                            the United States that the companies have found it impossible to arrive
                            at an agreement with the Mexican Government for adjusting equitably the
                            controversy arising out of the forcible seizure of these properties.
                            Obviously it would not be appropriate for the Government of the United
                            States to undertake—and it is not being asked to undertake—negotiations
                            to determine the amount or method of paying a compensation which the
                            Mexican Government confessedly is both unable and unwilling to pay. It
                            is appropriate, however, in the present situation again to request the
                            Government of the United <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0701"/>States
                            to call upon the Mexican Government to return to the possession and
                            control of American citizens their properties which have been unlawfully
                            seized and held by the Mexican Government, and to call upon the Mexican
                            Government to recompense the owners of these properties for all damages
                            and losses resulting from that unlawful seizure and from the subsequent
                            exploitation of these properties by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>We think it would be also appropriate for the Government of the United
                            States to remind the Mexican Government that the companies are not to be
                            regarded as suitors for favor but as associations of injured American
                            citizens who have been despoiled of rights acknowledged wherever
                            civilized people are engaged in peaceful commerce among nations.</p>
                        <p>We believe that we have kept the Department so fully informed of the
                            progress of these negotiations that the Department now understands how
                            patiently and conscientiously we have striven to find an early and just
                            solution of this controversy.</p>

                            <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have received and
                                given careful consideration to your letter from Mexicali dated July
                                5, 1939, in which you state the position of the Mexican Government
                                and propose a settlement of the oil question based in part upon the
                                Modified Memorandum of June 18 which you submitted to President
                                Cárdenas.</p>
                            <p>Before receiving your letter I had felt that, through discussions
                                with President Cárdenas in Mexico City and in Saltillo and
                                subsequent discussions with you in Washington, we had reached a
                                fairly clear understanding of the essentials of any agreement which
                                could be acceptable to the oil companies and the Mexican Government.
                                The propositions advanced in your letter of July 5 depart so far
                                from such an understanding that in reviewing them briefly I find it
                                necessary to restate the essential positions taken by the oil
                                companies in the efforts made to reach an agreement.</p>
                            <p>We have heretofore agreed upon the desirability of long-term
                                contracts between the Mexican Government and each of the groups of
                                companies in which would be consolidated the interests of each
                                specified group of investors, but it was certainly understood that
                                the Corporation being formed by investors would represent their
                                interests <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0702"/>and be a private
                                industrial enterprise. Obviously, it would not be a Government
                                corporation since it would enter into a contract with the government
                                for the development of oil properties created, and to be expanded,
                                by investors of private capital. Therefore, the proposal that a
                                majority of the Board of Directors and the President of the Company
                                should be Mexicans appointed by the Mexican Government (which is
                                made in your letter of July 5) is wholly inconsistent with the
                                entire theory and purpose of our discussions. Such a corporation as
                                you propose would be essentially a Government corporation to which
                                private investors would be expected to contribute money and property
                                without any such control as would justify such private
                                investment.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion made in the Memorandum of June 18 that a majority of
                                the Board of Directors should be Mexicans raised the immediate
                                question, when this Memorandum was subsequently presented to my
                                clients, that such a Board might be assumed to be under the control
                                of the Mexican Government instead of under the control of the
                                stockholders who elected it. The reasonableness of this criticism is
                                now borne out by the proposition bluntly presented in your letter of
                                July 5 that the President and a majority of the Board should be
                                appointed by and under the control of the Mexican Government. I have
                                repeatedly pointed out to you and to President Cárdenas that private
                                investors would not think of contributing their money and property
                                to a Government-controlled corporation since this would mean simply
                                lending money to the Government.</p>
                            <p>I am compelled to call your attention again to the basic principle
                                under which these negotiations were undertaken which was stated in
                                the memorandum of objectives which were adopted as the foundation
                                for the negotiations which began on March 8 in Mexico City. This
                                first principle read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Provision through the medium of a long term contract for the
                                        operation by the respective companies of properties taken,
                                        in accordance with the terms of the contract free from
                                        restrictions, claims or obligations not embodied
                                        therein.”</p>
                                </quote>
                     </p>
                            <p>We have agreed heretofore that through the medium of a long-term
                                contract and supervision of operations under that contract the
                                Mexican Government would be vested with appropriate and adequate
                                means to secure contract performance so that all National and
                                Governmental interests would be thoroughly protected. But it has
                                been made clear over and over again that the essential basis for
                                inducing contributions of private money and capital necessary for
                                the development of these oil properties was the control of
                                operations by the chosen representatives of the investors.</p>
                            <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0703"/>
                            <p>In your letter of July 5 you bring forward a new proposition for the
                                distribution of the revenues of the new oil corporations which
                                discards all the progress made in our previous discussions of this
                                question. It is now proposed that after operating expenses and taxes
                                have been deducted, “the remaining proceeds will be divided between
                                the two partners (Government and Companies) in the proportion
                                determined in each contract.” However, until receiving your letter
                                of July 5 I had thought it was practically agreed that Government
                                revenues would be fixed in the contract, probably through a fixed
                                percentage of the oil produced. Thereby the Government would be
                                absolutely assured of substantial and appropriate revenues and there
                                would be no controversies in the future over Government taxation or
                                over the rights of the investors to the proceeds of operations
                                remaining after the payment of adequate wages, the payment of taxes
                                and the payment of other operating costs. Through the methods
                                previously discussed we would avoid the difficulties which are now
                                presented anew in seeking to determine what proportion of the net
                                proceeds would go to the private investors. The private investors
                                would take the risk of recompensing themselves during the period of
                                the contract for their contributions and of amortizing their
                                investments, and the Government would be assured of definite
                                revenues.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, in making the proposition contained in your letter of July
                                5 the uninviting prospect is held forth that there may be no
                                remaining proceeds, because it is proposed that the expenses shall
                                include “all wages and services to the workers as granted to them by
                                the decision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Board.” One of the
                                matters most extensively discussed as to which we appeared to be
                                heretofore in agreement was the need expressed in the Memorandum of
                                June 18 as “a reciprocal guarantee of reasonable and workable labor
                                conditions and the means for establishing and maintaining such
                                conditions.” We have hitherto discussed and apparently agreed upon
                                three principles to effectuate this “reciprocal guarantee.” <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>That a schedule would be written in the contract,</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>That standards for revision of the schedule would be
                                        stated in the contract, and</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>That a method of applying such standards impartially would
                                        be provided in the contract.</item>
                                </list>
                     </p>
                            <p>It is evident that if wages and working conditions are to be
                                determined at the uncontrolled will of the Arbitration and
                                Conciliation Board, there may be little or no proceeds left to
                                provide the Government with revenues or the investors with any
                                recompense for their contributions. Consequently, under the proposal
                                contained in your letter of July 5 insurmountable obstacles are
                                presented to the making of any contract.</p>
                            <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0704"/>
                            <p>You will readily see from the foregoing observations that it would be
                                useless to undertake the negotiations suggested in Mexico City.
                                Indeed, the proposals made in your letter, which are completely
                                unacceptable to my clients, are so entirely incompatible with the
                                tenor of our previous conversations that I am regretfully forced to
                                conclude that the efforts heretofore made to arrive at an
                                understanding of basic principles have now been abandoned; and,
                                without such an understanding, further negotiations would be
                                useless.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called to see me this morning. The Ambassador told
                            me that he had yesterday received a personal and confidential letter
                            from President Cárdenas which the Ambassador classified as “ambiguous”
                            and which he said contained no precise instructions. President Cárdenas,
                            in referring to the communication the Ambassador had made to him of a
                            personal and informal suggestion I had made as to a possible solution on
                            a temporary basis of the problem of management and operation of the four
                            Mexican corporations to be set up to handle the expropriated properties
                            of the American oil companies, stated that he did not see how this plan
                            would place control of management and operation in the hands of the
                            Mexican Government since the list of individuals agreed upon by Mexico
                            and the United States, from which the companies and the Mexican
                            Government could select three directors on the board of directors, would
                            be composed of persons who had spent their lives in the oil industry and
                            who, for that reason, President Cárdenas said, would be more likely to
                            sympathize with the directors appointed by the oil companies than with
                            the directors appointed by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had immediately cabled President Cárdenas
                            explaining the real bases of the suggestion offered and requesting
                            specific instructions which the Ambassador said he thought he would have
                            by Friday morning.</p>
                        <p>I remarked to the Ambassador that it seemed to me that President Cárdenas
                            had totally misconstrued certain fundamental points in the suggestion I
                            had offered. I said that, in the first place, the list of men to be
                            agreed upon by the Mexican Government and by the United States
                            Government was not intended to be limited to individuals engaged in the
                            oil industry, and that I had specifically stated to the Ambassador that
                            I thought the individuals so selected might well <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0705"/>be persons not engaged in the oil
                            industry but persons who had had experience in commerce or in finance. I
                            had stated, I emphasized, that what I thought was required for the
                            individuals comprising this list was recognized ability and character,
                            knowledge of business management and practical experience in some form
                            of finance or industry. Secondly, I said, the only reason I had made
                            this suggestion of a possible solution was because both the Mexican
                            Government and the companies were insisting upon entire control of
                            management and operation. The purpose of the suggestion I had offered
                            was to find a middle ground by which neither the Mexican Government nor
                            the companies would have complete control but by which the balance of
                            power between the two would be vested in the hands of impartial and
                            competent persons.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he himself understood this fully and it was
                            exactly these points which were contained in his cable yesterday to
                            President Cárdenas.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador spoke to me of a telegram he had received from Mr.
                            Richberg advising him that the oil companies were going to have a
                            meeting in New York this morning. I said I assumed that I would have
                            some word as to the result of these deliberations from Mr. Richberg by
                            tomorrow, Friday, morning and that I would appreciate it if the
                            Ambassador would inform me as soon as possible after he had received the
                            specific instructions he had requested from President Cárdenas.</p>
                        <p>As he was leaving the Ambassador asked me if I had any further
                            information with regard to the difficulties of El Carrizal. I said I had
                            had no word. The Ambassador said he was glad to tell me that he had this
                            morning received a personal letter from the private secretary of the
                            Mexican President telling him that President Cárdenas had sent personal
                            and positive instructions to Governor Marte Gomez of the State of
                            Tamaulipas informing him that he desired the situation of the Carrizal
                            Corporation in connection with its labor difficulty cleared up
                            immediately and that the just demands of the company were to be granted.
                            I expressed my appreciation to the Ambassador for the information given
                            me, as well as for the personal trouble which he had taken upon so many
                            occasions with regard to this case.</p>

                        <p>On March 18, 1938, the Mexican Government by decree undertook to
                            expropriate the properties in Mexico of certain foreign owned, including
                            American owned, oil companies operating there.</p>
                        <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0706"/>
                        <p>This action was similar in nature, although involving investments of far
                            greater magnitude, to the steps taken by the Mexican Government in
                            recent years to expropriate farm and other properties belonging to
                            American citizens. With regard to the seizure of these agrarian
                            properties, this Government had consistently pointed out that in the
                            exercise of the admitted right of all sovereign nations to expropriate
                            private property, such expropriation must be accompanied, in accordance
                            with the recognized principles of international law, by provision on the
                            part of the Government of Mexico for adequate, effective, and prompt
                            payment for the properties seized. This latter problem was largely
                            settled when on November 9–12, 1938, the two Governments exchanged
                                communications<note n="50" xml:id="d645fn50">For exchange of notes,

                            agreeing upon a satisfactory procedure for the determination of the fair
                            compensation to be given American citizens whose lands have been taken
                            subsequent to August 30, 1927, and in consequence of which agreement the
                            Mexican Government will provide compensation in cash for such
                            properties.</p>
                        <p>Immediately following the action taken to expropriate the petroleum
                            properties belonging to American citizens, this Government informed the
                            Mexican Government of its expectation that prompt compensation would be
                            made in the form of just and effective payment to the extent of the fair
                            and equitable valuation of such properties. This Government’s position
                            is firmly based not only on well recognized rules of international law;
                            the elemental considerations of justice and of fair dealing which should
                            govern the relations between nations demand such payment for the
                            properties taken. The attitude of applying the principles of established
                            international law in the solution of this problem has been consistently
                            maintained by every official of the United States Government in its
                            representations to both parties to the controversy throughout the period
                            of the discussion. Furthermore, the close and friendly understanding
                            which this Government desires to continue to maintain with the
                            Government of Mexico requires the reciprocal assurance on the part of
                            both Governments that their relations will in fact be governed by such
                            principles of justice and of fair dealing.</p>
                        <p>In the decree of expropriation itself and on numerous occasions
                            subsequently, the Mexican Government recognized its liability to make
                            compensation and stated its willingness to discuss terms with the
                            petroleum companies concerned. Since that time there have been
                            discussions between representatives of the Mexican Government and of the
                            petroleum companies in an endeavor to come to some fair and equitable
                            agreement. This Government has continuously and consistently sought to
                            facilitate and to further these negotiations by conferring with both
                            sides, first with one and then with the other. For <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0707"/>a time the conversations between both
                            parties proceeded satisfactorily, appearing to hold promise of an
                            eventual solution. A set of bases of discussion, within the scope of
                            which there might be found an agreement for the future operation of the
                            industry, were believed to be determined, but recently a serious
                            obstacle to final agreement was encountered. In this situation this
                            Government, without prior consultation with either party, and in
                            accordance with its repeatedly demonstrated desire to further an
                            agreement, informally laid before both parties a suggested solution of
                            this obstacle, without requesting or receiving any commitment or
                            obligation on the part of either party to accept it.</p>
                        <p>This proposal was as follows: Each party had claimed that it must control
                            the management and operation of new companies, which it had been agreed
                            in principle might be established to operate the properties seized. In
                            an endeavor to overcome the deadlock, this Government informally offered
                            the suggestion that the Boards of Directors, as a temporary arrangement,
                            and pending a final agreement, be composed of nine persons, three
                            appointed by the Mexican Government, three appointed by the petroleum
                            companies, and three selected by the two parties from a panel of nine
                            drawn up in mutual agreement by the Governments of Mexico and of the
                            United States. In order to attain complete impartiality on this panel of
                            nine, no persons were to be included who came from any country whose
                            citizens had a direct and important interest in any of the petroleum
                            companies involved. These persons were all to be of demonstrated
                            integrity and standing, and of practical experience in commerce,
                            finance, or in the petroleum industry itself. This proposal seemed to
                            offer a temporary middle ground on which the Mexican Government and the
                            petroleum companies could have met with the balance between them resting
                            in the hands of impartial and competent persons.</p>
                        <p>This Government naturally regrets that a proposal suggested for no other
                            purpose than to reconcile a major difference of approach which
                            threatened a breakdown in the present negotiations should have been
                            discarded by either party without the fullest exploration of its
                            possibilities, especially when both parties fully comprehended the
                            purpose for which it was put forward.</p>
                        <p>It is of course evident that a solution of this controversy must be found
                            in accordance with the basic principles of international law, as this
                            Government has invariably insisted at every step of the present
                            negotiations. A continuance of the dispute not only will dislocate still
                            further beneficial commercial relations between Mexico and the United
                            States, with great economic losses to both countries, but more important
                            still, it will constitute a material barrier to the maintenance of that
                            close and friendly understanding between Mexico and the <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0708"/>United States which both Governments
                            regard as in the best interests of the two peoples.</p>
                        <p>The discontinuance of the present discussions can of course in no sense
                            relieve the Mexican Government of its obligation to make prompt,
                            adequate, and effective compensation for the petroleum properties which
                            have been taken, if the expropriation is to be regarded as valid. At the
                            same time, however, this Government expects that its own citizens with
                            direct interest in this controversy will give the most ample and
                            attentive consideration to all constructive proposals that are advanced
                            to overcome the difficulties now standing in the way of a fair
                            settlement of the controversy which exists. In the rapid, fair, and
                            equitable solution of this controversy, the interests of their
                            Government are directly concerned.</p>

                        <p>212, In view of the statement by Acting Secretary Welles and the
                            statement given out to the press last night by the Foreign Minister on
                            oil situation please wire instructions. Thursday is the day I always
                            call on Foreign Minister but I can make arrangements sooner if desired
                            by the Department.</p>
                        <p>Substance of Hay’s message was that oil companies were “recalcitrant” and
                            were responsible for breaking off negotiations. He praised the “friendly
                            attitude” of the United States Government and said the Mexican
                            Government was willing to continue negotiations on the basis of those it
                            had proposed or other basis equally constructive that may be submitted.
                            He says that the oil companies had insisted upon a long term operating
                            contract with special compromises from the Mexican Government on tax
                            matters and labor agreements in violation of Mexican laws. He stated
                            “the companies in one way or another have insisted upon the return of
                            the properties for a certain length of time which without any doubt
                            would result in the drying up of the wells; on an obligation on the part
                            of the Mexican Government not to burden the industry in the future with
                            new taxes as well as to establish a special system in regard to labor
                            conditions distinct from that stipulated by the laws not recognizing on
                            the one hand the rights of the workers and paralyzing fiscal action of
                            the Government asking from the Government an abdication incompatible
                            with the sovereignty.” General Hay says his Government has invited
                            representatives of oil companies to a discussion looking to agreement on
                                <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0709"/>the value of properties
                            expropriated and was desirous of making prompt compensation in the shape
                            of a just and effective payment in accordance with an honest and
                            equitable valuation of the properties, adding that his Government had
                            incessantly manifested its good will to discuss the terms of
                            compensation. He adds that his Government will indemnify the companies
                            once the amount is known.</p>
                        <p>After charging responsibility for breaking off discussions General Hay
                            added that the Mexican Government was willing to deal with the oil
                            companies as a group or separately but that future discussions would
                            have to be on a basis on which conflict could be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Mexican morning papers display Hay’s statement and press articles from
                            Washington on first pages and in English sections. None of them make
                            editorial comment.</p>

                        <p>170. Your 212 is appreciated. At least until such time as it has
                            carefully examined the full text of General Hay’s statement which you
                            have forwarded by airmail, the Department has no suggestions to offer
                            regarding detailed observations it might desire to have made to General
                            Hay. In the meanwhile, however, in any conversations you may have with
                            General Hay or other high Mexican officials you should reiterate the
                            position taken by this Government in the public statement of August 14
                            and emphasize the very great importance attached by this Government to a
                            prompt settlement of the petroleum controversy.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s telegram
                            number 170 of August 16, 6 p.m., I have the honor to report that in my
                            usual Thursday call at the Foreign Office yesterday I expressed to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs my regret and disappointment at the impasse
                            reached in the negotiations with reference to the expropriation of the
                            oil properties by the Mexican Government, and added that in view of <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0710"/>our frequent discussions, in
                            which he had often expressed a hope of settlement, I felt sure he was
                            also disappointed. He said that I was right, and added: “But it is not
                            the fault of the Mexican Government.”</p>
                        <p>He then recalled that immediately after the decree of President Cárdenas
                            he had informed me that Mexico was determined to make just payment; that
                            he also knew that President Cárdenas had informed me that the officials
                            of his Government would be instructed to confer with the representatives
                            of the oil companies, looking toward an agreement as to the value of the
                            properties, so the Government could arrange for payment; and that there
                            had been a standing invitation on the part of his Government to meet
                            with the representatives of the oil companies to reach an agreement on
                            the sum that Mexico should pay. He said that offer had not been
                            withdrawn and his Government was ready now to enter upon such
                            discussions as it had proposed in March 1938 and later. He regretted
                            that the oil companies had declined even to enter upon such discussion,
                            and said his Government could not pay unless the sum due was agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>General Hay went on to say that, after the refusal by the oil companies
                            to discuss the value of the properties, his Government had agreed to
                            discussions with Mr. Richberg, seeking to find a basis of settlement
                            that would be fair and acceptable. But, he added, his Government would
                            never consent to the return of properties as the British had demanded,
                            and it could not agree to the proposals as to taxes and wages under a
                            long term contract which the representatives of the oil companies
                            insisted upon.</p>
                        <p>I said that the impasse was bad for the people of both countries, and
                            that the question now was not who was responsible for the break in the
                            negotiations, but that it was of the highest importance to discover a
                            way of agreement and settlement, and that Acting Secretary Welles had
                            suggested to both parties a method which invoked participation by
                            fair-minded neutrals, since the principals found it impossible to reach
                            an agreement. I told him that every consideration demanded a settlement
                            and that, since it was apparent that the parties had come to a
                            standstill, I saw no way to settle the matter without invoking
                            fair-minded and impartial outside participation.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation, in which he reiterated his desire for
                            a fair solution, he neither approved nor disapproved the plan suggested
                            by Acting Secretary Welles, but indicated that the determination was in
                            the hands of the President. I urged him to do all he could to further
                            some plan—and it would necessarily involve an outside party—to the
                            desired adjustment of a matter that pressed for settlement. He said that
                            he would give what I had said his serious consideration and he hoped
                            that a way could be evolved.</p>
                        <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0711"/>
                        <p>His conversation showed that he felt the oil companies were at fault.</p>
                        <p>I will resume the subject with him at our next meeting, but I am of the
                            opinion that the President himself has taken the whole matter into his
                            own hands.</p>

                        <p>235. Upon arrival by air here yesterday Castillo Nájera said, in summary,
                            that the companies had taken no steps to renew the suspended oil
                            conversations. He added that he believed the decision as to war or peace
                            in Europe would be taken by Saturday. He further said that the Mexican
                            political situation was not of interest to the United States as far as
                            he could see from public opinion there.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I wish to acknowledge
                            the receipt of your very friendly letter of July 29,<note n="51" xml:id="d650fn51">Not printed.</note> which has been handed to me by
                            your Ambassador in Washington.</p>
                        <p>You have written to me with entire frankness, and I desire to correspond
                            with equal frankness, since I know that we are both equally desirous of
                            doing what may be possible to prevent the continuation of any
                            controversy which has arisen between Your Excellency’s Government and
                            nationals of the United States, or of any controversy which might arise
                            between this Government and nationals of Mexico, because of our joint
                            recognition that so long as controversies of this character persist, so
                            long will it be difficult, if not impossible, for the peoples of our two
                            countries to attain that kind of neighborly relationship—free from
                            misunderstanding, suspicion, and ill-will, and rooted in trust and
                            friendship—which is so indispensable to the best interests and to the
                            progress of both nations.</p>
                        <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0712"/>
                        <p>In your letter which I am now acknowledging you refer specifically to the
                            dispute which has arisen between the Government of Mexico and certain
                            American companies because of the expropriation by the Mexican
                            Government of the properties of these companies located in Mexico. You
                            set forth the position assumed by the Government of Mexico in this
                            regard, and emphasize the many difficulties which have arisen in the
                            negotiations which have been undertaken between representatives of the
                            Government of Mexico and of the American companies to find a
                            satisfactory solution of the problem presented.</p>
                        <p>It had of course been my hope that both parties to the controversy which
                            unfortunately exists would recognize their equal responsibility in this
                            search for a fair and satisfactory solution, and that consequently an
                            agreement might have been reached long since.</p>
                        <p>As you know, throughout the period of these negotiations this Government
                            has done what it felt it appropriately could to facilitate and further
                            negotiations, conferring both with representatives of the Mexican
                            Government as well as with representatives of the American companies in
                            the endeavor to assist in the finding of some common meeting ground.
                            When it appeared a few weeks ago that these negotiations had reached a
                            complete deadlock, the Acting Secretary of State at my direction
                            informally laid before both your Ambassador in Washington and the
                            representatives of the companies a suggested solution of the chief point
                            of difficulty. The prompt discarding of this suggestion by the companies
                            concerned, and its rejection by the Government of Mexico thereafter was,
                            I am frank to say, most disheartening.</p>
                        <p>In your letter you state that “The expropriation decreed by the
                            Government of Mexico … constitutes a legitimate act of the Government of
                            Mexico, authorized by its own laws, similar in this point to those of
                            other nations, and sanctioned at the same time by the principles of
                            international law.”</p>
                        <p>As you say, the principle of international law is well known with regard
                            to the expropriation by one country of the property of citizens of
                            another. It requires prompt and effective payment to the extent of the
                            fair and equitable valuation of the property. In various official
                            communications addressed by this Government to the Government of Mexico,
                            it has been made very clear that the authority of the Mexican Government
                            to take property for purposes of public utility was not questioned, and
                            could not be questioned, but it was also pointed out that under
                            international law the procedure of expropriation requires as an integral
                            part for its fulfillment payment of just and adequate compensation. That
                            Your Excellency coincided in these views is made plain by the statement
                            in your letter that “In the light of the laws and principles” cited by
                            Your Excellency, and to which <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0713"/>reference has above been made, “the American companies affected can
                            only claim the payment of a just compensation the terms of which my
                            Government has been ready to fix.”</p>
                        <p>Since it is unfortunately evident that the negotiations which have been
                            in progress have resulted in no solution, and give no promise of
                            attaining any agreement satisfactory to the Government of Mexico and to
                            the companies, and since you inform me that the Mexican Government will
                            under no circumstances undertake to return the properties to the
                            American companies, there would seem to remain no other course of
                            procedure for the Government of Mexico other than the payment of prompt
                            and just compensation to the American companies for the properties
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>From the negotiations which have taken place, and from what you state in
                            your letter to me, it seems to be equally clear that the Mexican
                            Government and the American companies are in accord neither as to the
                            just valuation of the properties expropriated, nor as to the principles
                            which should determine the amount of compensation to be fixed. If these
                            questions remain unsettled there would seem unfortunately every
                            likelihood that the controversy which has arisen will remain in
                            existence for an indefinite period, with consequent grave prejudice to
                            that friendly feeling between both nations which it is my earnest desire
                            to promote.</p>
                        <p>As you may recall, in the autumn of 1937, prior to the expropriation by
                            the Mexican Government of these American-owned properties, both of our
                            Governments had taken up for review all of the questions of difference
                            between the two countries, some of them of long standing, with the
                            intention of undertaking to compose all of these questions in a manner
                            which would be just and equitable to both countries, thus clearing the
                            horizon of Mexican-American relations of all matters which might at any
                            time disturb them. Because of the long protracted controversy with
                            regard to the expropriation of oil properties, the negotiations then
                            envisaged have remained in abeyance.</p>
                        <p>I now make the suggestion that the two Governments agree, without further
                            delay, to take up all of these questions with a view to their individual
                            solution in such manner as the two Governments may in each case
                            determine to be best suited to the achievement of a satisfactory
                            settlement. I further suggest that we include among the questions so to
                            be settled in the immediate future the question of compensation for the
                            American-owned oil properties expropriated and that both Governments
                            agree that the question of the compensation to be paid for these
                            properties be submitted to the decision of impartial arbitrators,
                            selected either in accordance with the provisions of treaties or
                            conventions to which both Governments may be parties, or to be selected
                            by common determination; this suggestion <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0714"/>being based upon the premise that the Government of
                            Mexico is willing to provide compensation in accordance with the
                            decision of the arbitrators, and that the arbitral award must determine
                            the time and form of payment. It would further be my suggestion that the
                            terms of the arbitral submission, should the suggestion prove acceptable
                            to you and to the Government of Mexico, be determined as a result of an
                            understanding to be drawn up by the Government of Mexico and by duly
                            authorized representatives of the American companies whose properties
                            have been expropriated, or by the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mexico and the United States live side by side. Both nations have been
                            confronted with many difficult problems during the last six years, but I
                            am confident that, given the exceedingly friendly understanding which
                            fortunately exists between our two Governments, a satisfactory solution
                            can be found for all of the problems between the two nations which yet
                            remain unsettled and to which I have referred; By the peaceful and
                            friendly adjustment of all of these questions, the Governments of Mexico
                            and of the United States can give to a world sorely beset by distrust,
                            fear, and violence, an admirable example of how with good-will the
                            governments and peoples of two neighboring countries can in a peaceful,
                            friendly, and satisfactory way resolve their differences.</p>
                        <p>I wish to express my very particular appreciation of your most friendly
                            and understanding letter and I warmly reciprocate the good wishes which
                            you have extended to me.</p>
                        <p>With the assurances of my high personal regard, believe me</p>
                        <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                        <p>272. We have learned very confidentially from the French Legation that
                            the day after war was declared by France on Germany, Suarez sent for the
                            French Commercial Attaché to make him a proposition to have either the
                            French Government or French private interests make extensive purchases
                            of Mexico [<hi rend="italic">Mexican oil?</hi>]. At the same time he
                            offered to work out a plan of industrial collaboration with the French.
                            The French Commercial Attaché had for some time prior to the declaration
                            of war urged his Government to consider the purchase of Mexican oil in
                            exchange for French exports. He has never received any reply to these
                            suggestions from the French Government and <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0715"/>French Legation considers it unlikely that the French
                            Government will at present favorably consider offers of oil from Mexico.
                            They consider the suggestion of industrial collaboration made by Suarez
                            to be impracticable.</p>
                        <p>We learn informally and confidentially from Petroleos Mexicanos that the
                            German Legation and the Mexican Government have reached an understanding
                            to continue shipments of oil to Germany via Italy and to receive German
                            or Italian goods in return via Italy.</p>

                        <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are convinced that the
                            altered conditions resulting from the outbreak of the war would render
                            it more than ever necessary that they should adhere to their policy of
                            doing nothing which would condone the arbitrary character of the
                            expropriations of the British oil properties in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government feel that the circumstances are now more
                            favourable for a reasonable settlement of the dispute, and they
                            therefore hope that the United States Government may see their way to
                            use their influence to this end.</p>

                        <p>30. For the Under Secretary from Duggan. Ambassador Daniels who passed
                            through Washington last night stated that President Cárdenas has not yet
                            made up his mind regarding the reply to be made to the President’s
                            letter. President Cárdenas indicated, however, that while the procedure
                            suggested in the President’s letter, particularly that part dealing with
                            the solution of the petroleum controversy, might be acceptable to him he
                            felt that the companies had not yet really made a whole-hearted effort
                            to come to a solution through direct negotiations with him. Inasmuch as
                            Mexican public opinion holds the same view he thought that inability to
                            arrive at an agreement would have to be clearly demonstrated to public
                            opinion before it would be possible for the Mexican Government to go
                            forward with arbitration. He said that he would send his reply by
                            Castillo Nájera whose departure from Mexico City has now been postponed
                            until October 8. He is due to arrive in Washington October 12.

                            the Mexican Government or whether it should undertake its own

                            the Mexican oil negotiations and the interest of Dutch Shell in that
                            connection. He said he was under the impression that there might be
                            increased opportunities for a settlement and that his Government hoped
                            this Government would stand firm in insisting on the rights of our
                            nationals.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I felt constrained to await the return of the Mexican

                            predictions; that I hoped the present situation, which leaves Mexico
                            without an oil market, would encourage her to offer reasonable
                            settlement with our oil owners; that, of course, my Government had
                            overlooked no word or act from the beginning that would be helpful in
                            promoting a settlement; that it went without saying that this Government
                            “is standing firm,” to use the Minister’s expression, arid doing all

                        <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this morning by appointment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired with regard to developments in the Mexican oil

                            only feasible solution was a partnership between the Mexican Government
                            and the companies providing for a division of the profits from the oil
                            properties with the management of the <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0718"/>properties placed in the hands of competent neutral
                            parties. The Ambassador expressed his personal regret that the companies
                            had refused to accept the suggestion which the Department of State had
                            made to this effect some months ago.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bursley</hi>: I am strongly inclined to the
                            belief that at least at the present stage it is unwise to employ too
                            many cooks in preparing this particular broth. At the present time we
                            are dealing with the Mexican Government through the Mexican Ambassador
                            in Washington who is undoubtedly in close and continuing contact with
                            President Cárdenas himself with regard to all phases of the oil problem.
                            Until and unless these efforts prove completely fruitless, I believe it
                            would be unwise to give any encouragement whatever to any other
                            individuals who suggest solutions of this problem.</p>

                        <p>The Mexican Ambassador called to see me this afternoon at my request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commenced the conversation by telling me that he had had
                            two recent interviews with Mr. Patrick J. Hurley in representation of
                            the five Mexican companies affiliated with the Sinclair Company and was
                            to have a further meeting later this afternoon. The Ambassador told me
                            that Mr. Hurley had suggested carrying out the expressed intention of
                            the Sinclair group to undertake negotiations directly with the Mexican
                            Government and to thus separate itself from the Standard and Shell
                            companies, and that the Sinclair group would be willing to accept
                            30,000,000 barrels of oil from the expropriated properties as full
                            compensation for the value of the Sinclair properties expropriated and
                            as part of the same deal would agree to purchase from the Mexican
                            Government 15,000,000 barrels of oil from the Mexican Government oil
                            fields. The arrangement suggested by Mr. Hurley further contemplated
                            that the 30,000,000 barrels of oil to be paid by the Mexican Government
                            would be paid <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0719"/>at the rate of
                            10,000 barrels a day, increasing up to 40,000 barrels a day when and if
                            the expropriated properties were so managed as to make this greater
                            output possible. Mr. Hurley’s estimate as to the time involved during
                            which such compensation would be made would range from seven to ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador told me that he had replied to Mr. Hurley that the amount
                            of compensation in oil suggested by Mr. Hurley was altogether in excess
                            of the value of the properties and had reminded Mr. Hurley that two of
                            the five companies in question had offered some years ago to let the
                            Mexican Government take over their properties for nothing inasmuch as
                            they were alleged to be losing money at the rate of some $2,000,000 a
                            year. The Ambassador had further pointed out to Mr. Hurley, he said,
                            that inasmuch as oil was now selling at approximately one dollar a
                            barrel, this would mean compensation to the Sinclair group amounting to
                            $30,000,000, and would necessarily imply, at the rate of valuation
                            claimed by the foreign companies, the payment of some $300,000,000 to
                            the Standard Oil Company group which was very far in excess of what the
                            Mexican Government believed the proper valuation of the properties of
                            that group to be. The Ambassador finally said that Mr. Hurley agreed
                            that the amount asked was for bargaining purposes and that they could
                            reach an agreement providing for a lesser amount in the way of
                            compensation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then went on to say that the Mexican Government’s
                            valuation of the foreign oil properties expropriated was nearing
                            completion, and that although the Ambassador had believed that the
                            valuation fixed by the Mexican Government was going to be unduly low, he
                            was relieved to find that it would probably run about $100,000,000.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a discussion of the agrarian claims. For portions of the
                            memorandum dealing with this question, see <ref target="#pg_660">page

                        <p>As he was leaving the Ambassador said that three years ago when Mr.
                            George Rublee, who had been in Mexico for some time as representative of
                            the American bondholders group, had finally succeeded in reaching an
                            agreement for resumption of payment on the foreign debt with the Mexican
                            authorities and President Cárdenas had actually instructed the Mexican
                            Secretary of the Treasury, Señor Suarez, to sign the agreement,
                            Ambassador Daniels had gone to the Mexican Secretary of the Treasury to
                            tell him that the Government of the United States was not interested in
                            the agreement inasmuch as a large percentage of the bondholders were not
                            American citizens and that the Government of the United States saw no
                            reason why any payment should be made to the American bondholders for
                            that reason. The Ambassador said that as soon as this information was
                            given to President Cárdenas by Señor Suarez the instructions previously
                            given to sign the agreement were revoked and the whole matter went by
                            the <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0720"/>board with resultant
                            prejudice to the already seriously debilitated credit of the Mexican
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that with the
                            final decision of the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of
                            the Expropriation Law of 1936 and the Expropriation Decree of March 18,
                            1938, the next step taken by the Government has been to proceed with the
                            appraisal of the companies’ properties in accordance with judicial
                            procedure.</p>
                        <p>The metropolitan press of December 5, 1939, prints a statement in
                            quotation from the Attorney General of the Republic, Licenciado Genaro
                            V. Vázquez, which I quote in translation as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    appraisal of the properties expropriated from the petroleum

                                    Government, as well as those which have no fiscal value, and
                                    which were affected by virtue of the Decree of March 18,
                                    1938.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>From information previously received from various sources and
                            particularly from a conversation which the Commercial Attaché had with
                            Finance Minister Suárez, it seems quite definite that the Federal
                            Government has already practically completed the appraisal of all
                            company property. The Commercial Attaché recalls that Minister Suárez
                            intimated that the properties belonging to American companies show an
                            approximate value of ten million dollars, and those properties belonging
                            to other nations of an equal value. No doubt, the judicial procedure now
                            instituted by the Attorney General is for the purpose of compelling the
                            companies through court action to agree legally to an appraisal of
                            properties, or, if not, their denial would probably permit the
                            Government legally to proceed on appraisals, and evaluations, made
                            solely by the Government, or, in conjunction with other appraisal
                            experts appointed by the Court.</p>

                        <p>392. According to the press of December 5th Attorney General initiated
                            before the First Civil District Court procedure for the appraisal of
                            properties expropriated from the petroleum companies. Under such
                            procedure the district court will cite petroleum companies to appear and
                            appoint an appraisal expert who must be designated within three days
                            after presentation of summons. Attorney General is quoted in the press
                            as saying that appraisal of companies’ property is next to last step in
                            oil controversy with the fixing of the form of payment as the last.
                            Information received indicates that court will attempt to present
                            summons Thursday or Friday. If companies do not appoint appraiser then
                            court can appoint one for them and proceed with appraisals legally.
                            Sollenberger of Huasteca Petroleum Company left by plane today to confer
                            with Standard officials in New York on Thursday at 10 a.m. He stated
                            that from local Mexican angle it would be to companies’ advantage to
                            appoint appraiser rather than to permit court to do so. He said that
                            from an international <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0722"/>angle it
                            might be unwise to do so and for that reason he was flying to New York.
                            Sollenberger further stated that he believed acts of his company would
                            depend upon attitude of Department of State. If the Department shows no
                            inclination to intervene on behalf of companies under assumption denial
                            of justice had resulted from legal procedure in Mexico it would place
                            companies in a very difficult position in making a decision as to
                            whether or not to continue the battle or accept principle of
                            compensation. Sollenberger expressed his views to the effect that if the

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that some of
                            the Aguila petroleum officials who attended petroleum conferences in New
                            York during the latter part of last week returned Saturday afternoon by
                            plane to Mexico City. We were confidentially advised that the companies
                            decided not to take any notice of the Mexican First Civil District
                            Court’s summons for an appraiser and, accordingly, they will not appoint
                            an appraiser. According to law, the court will appoint an appraiser to
                            represent them and the legal proceedings will continue.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that from the beginning the Aguila group have
                            insisted upon the return of their properties, and it seems that their
                            position has not changed.</p>
                        <p>While the actual hour in which the three-days summons of the court will
                            expire has not been definitely determined, it is calculated that it will
                            not be later than Wednesday of this week.</p>

                        <p>[For the first part of this memorandum on the subject of agrarian
                            expropriations, see <ref target="#pg_664">page 664</ref>.]</p>
                        <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0723"/>
                        <p>I then passed to the subject of the oil problem and said to the
                            Ambassador, after a few moments discussion, that since he now confirmed
                            to me what Mr. Richberg said, namely, that both the Mexican Government
                            and the oil companies had reached the conclusion that negotiations were
                            now impossible, it seemed to me that there was no solution now available
                            other than arbitration. The Ambassador inquired whether I meant
                            arbitration as to the value of the properties. I said that I did not but
                            that I was not prepared at this stage to give him any indication as to
                            what this Government believed arbitration should cover. I said that I
                            hoped within a few days to ask the Ambassador to have another
                            conversation with me when I might explain to him by authorization of the
                            President and after the Secretary of State had had an opportunity of
                            giving fullest consideration to the problem, what the views of this
                            Government with regard thereto might be.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I stated to the Ambassador that the Secretary of State had
                            requested me to say to him that now that the generalization of duty
                            reductions on petroleum imports was to become effective within the next
                            few days and that under the allocation of quotas determined upon by this
                            Government Mexico would be enabled to compete for the 3.8 percent of
                            imports allotted to countries not accorded a specific quota, if Mexico
                            attempted to export to the United States any petroleum from expropriated
                            properties Mexico would create such a storm of indignation in the United
                            States as to have very seriously prejudicial effects upon the friendly
                            relations between the two countries. I said that the Secretary of State
                            and I both hoped for this reason that the Government of Mexico would
                            take effective steps to see that no petroleum from Mexico was exported
                            to the United States. The Ambassador took this statement very calmly and
                            said that he understood our point of view and would communicate
                            immediately with his Government in that sense.</p>

                            and the oil companies. Lord Lothian informed the Foreign Office that as
                            a result of his interview with Mr. Sumner Welles he understood the
                            present position to be that President Cárdenas had expressed his
                            readiness to resume negotiations with the oil companies on the broadest
                            lines, and that the United States authorities felt, and President
                            Cárdenas was understood to agree, that if the companies were unwilling
                            to embark on such negotiations, or if the negotiations were
                            unsuccessful, the dispute should be referred to arbitration in order to
                            decide: <list>

                  </p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have given most careful
                            consideration to these latest developments in the situation. They fully
                            appreciate the anxiety of the United States Government to bring about an
                            early settlement of the oil dispute and would themselves be the first to
                            welcome such a settlement if it could be achieved on reasonable terms.
                            They have also taken into account the decision reached by the Mexican
                            Supreme Court on December 2nd, which they consider to be merely the last
                            step in what has been a policy of spoliation under the guise of law.
                            This decision, however, ends all possibility of the companies obtaining
                            just redress by invoking the legal methods open to them in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government are convinced that it is only possible to reach
                            an honest solution of the Mexican oil question by standing firmly on a
                            clear principle. Where disputes, like that which has arisen in Mexico,
                            arise between a sovereign state and foreign companies exploiting natural
                            resources within it there are only two bases on <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0725"/>which a successful solution can rest.
                            The first is by the expropriation of the rights and properties of the
                            foreign companies at a fair valuation and in return for prompt,
                            effective and adequate payment of compensation. This method, however, is
                            only possible in the case of an economically developed state, which is
                            solvent, and can therefore pay cash or its equivalent for what it
                            expropriates. The second is by an arrangement whereby the foreign
                            company is granted a long lease of the asset on agreed terms which on
                            the one side will provide for proper labour conditions and royalties and
                            on the other will enable the companies to make reasonable profits and
                            recoup themselves for the capital outlay in discovery, equipment and
                            development. In this [<hi rend="italic">those?</hi>] countries in which
                            the state is unwilling or unable to pay full compensation for
                            expropriation, this is the basis upon which the development of natural
                            assets is now taking place all over the world with satisfactory results
                            and with due regard to the sovereign rights of the countries
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is quite clear that the first principle is inapplicable in the case of
                            Mexico today. The Mexican Government has long been in default on its
                            external debt. It has not the credit upon which it could borrow the sums
                            which any impartial tribunal would award as the value of rights and
                            properties of the oil companies if they were expropriated. It has not
                            the means with which to pay prompt, effective and adequate compensation.
                            Nor is there the least likelihood of its being able to manage the seized
                            oil wells in such a way that it could pay fair wages to labour, fair
                            interest on an impartial valuation of the companies’ properties
                            including the amortization of the capital within a reasonable time, and
                            obtain any revenue for the Mexican State as well. His Majesty’s
                            Government, therefore, feel bound to maintain the attitude which they
                            have consistently adopted against the policy of expropriation. The
                            grounds for this attitude were fully set out in His Majesty’s Embassy’s
                                <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of March 25th, 1938,<note n="59" xml:id="d667fn59">Not printed.</note> and it was made clear on
                            several occasions—notably in the conversations between Sir Ronald
                            Lindsay and the Under Secretary of State on May 6th, 1938, between Mr.
                            Mallet and Mr. Duggan on October 11th 1938, and between Mr. Mallet and
                            Mr. Welles on January 6th—that His Majesty’s Government had in no way
                            departed from their original standpoint. This fact was confirmed once
                            again by His Majesty’s Ambassador in his interview with the Secretary of
                            State on September 20th. His Majesty’s Government were glad to note that
                            the United States Government themselves enunciated the same principle in
                            their communication of July 21st, 1938, to the Mexican Government<note n="60" xml:id="d667fn60">

                            insisted that the Mexican Government should make prompt and effective
                            compensation to the oil companies if the expropriation was to be
                            regarded as valid.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government feel unable to agree to the proposal to submit
                            the question of the value of the rights and properties to be
                            expropriated and the method and time of payment to arbitration. In view
                            of the foregoing considerations as to the financial condition of Mexico
                            it is clear that when the arbitral award has been given the Mexican
                            Government will still in fact be unable to pay compensation in any
                            reasonable time. If the proposal about arbitration were adopted the
                            position, after the award had been given, would be just as it is today,
                            with the Mexican Government operating the wells and unable to pay
                            adequate, prompt and effective compensation, and with all the present
                            bitterness and controversy unremoved.</p>
                        <p>Nor are His Majesty’s Government convinced that the inclusion in the
                            suggested terms of reference to arbitration of the question of time and
                            method of payment of compensation would afford any safeguard against
                            Mexico’s example being followed elsewhere. On the contrary they are
                            persuaded that to proceed on such a basis in view of Mexico’s known
                            financial condition would inevitably be followed by most undesirable
                            repercussions in other actual and potential oil producing countries not
                            merely in Latin America but elsewhere and would moreover react adversely
                            upon the contractual relations of United States and British nationals
                            with foreign governments in other spheres of commercial activity. His
                            Majesty’s Government have frequently made it clear in the past that they
                            are bound to pay most serious consideration to the bearing of the
                            Mexican dispute upon other countries and to take into account the world
                            wide strategic issues involved. More than ever now when the maintenance
                            of their established national oil companies not merely in Latin America
                            but also in Iran and Iraq is a vital interest from the standpoint of
                            national defence are His Majesty’s Government concerned to refrain from
                            any move in regard to Mexico which could be interpreted elsewhere as a
                            sign that they had weakened on the point of principle involved.</p>
                        <p>In view of all these considerations His Majesty’s Government are
                            convinced that the only justifiable course and the only course which is
                            likely to produce a final and stable settlement within a reasonable
                            time, is to stand squarely on the principle that inasmuch as Mexico is
                            unable to produce prompt, effective and adequate compensation the only
                            basis for settlement is that the operation of the properties should be
                            returned to the companies on a sufficiently long lease and upon agreed
                            terms as to labour conditions and royalties. The operation <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0727"/>of the industry by people of specialist
                            experience, who are concerned with efficiency and not politics, and who
                            are able to provide, from time to time, the fresh capital necessary for
                            the development and maintenance of the industry, is, in fact, the only
                            way in which today Mexico can obtain the revenue of which she is in
                            need, labour can obtain reasonable conditions and the legitimate rights
                            of the oil companies be secured. The restoration to the companies of
                            full control over the operation and management of their oil properties
                            is the inescapable condition of any sound solution. Once that principle
                            is accepted, there are many ways in which the other aspects of the
                            problem can be solved.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government venture to hope that the United States
                            Government shares this view.</p>
                        <p>Proposals on these lines—sometimes referred to as the Five Points—were
                            made to the Mexican Government through Mr. Richberg in March last and
                            for some time it seemed probable that they would be accepted by
                            President Cárdenas as an acceptable basis for negotiations. The
                            equipment of the oil industry in Mexico is deteriorating for want of new
                            capital. The foreign sale of Mexican oil is increasingly difficult owing
                            to the war and for other reasons. The real obstacle in the way is not
                            that the Five Point proposals are unfair or unjust to Mexico—they
                            constitute indeed, the only solution which will economically benefit
                            Mexico and be conformable with her national honour. It lies in the main
                            in the present internal political conditions in Mexico itself, and
                            these, like the political conditions in all countries, are fluid and not
                            unresponsive to considerations of reason and justice and of national
                            advantage, if consistently pressed.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore still the hope of His Majesty’s Government that time, the
                            economic facts, and patient adherence to sound basic principles, will
                            end in the dispute being settled to the satisfaction of both parties and
                            it is their understanding that the companies are ready at any time to
                            renew discussions on the basis of the proposals mentioned above. In the
                            meantime, however, His Majesty’s Government would strongly deprecate any
                            solution which would have the appearance of a surrender to <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> and, as the matter stands, they
                            earnestly trust that the United States Government will appreciate the
                            reasons which dictate their inability to depart from their present
                            policy.</p>

                                <item>Nicaragua has no desire or intention of repudiating the
                                    Treaty, although there is some opinion in Nicaragua to the
                                    effect that the Treaty provisions entail the sacrifice of
                                    certain elements of sovereignty, and that the Treaty was not
                                    negotiated by a free and independent government representative
                                    of the Nicaraguan people. (The implication was that the
                                    Nicaraguan Government which negotiated the Treaty did so during
                                    the U. S. Marine occupation of the country.)</item>

                                <item>The present Government of Nicaragua feels that if the United
                                    States does not exercise its right to construct a canal it will
                                    adversely affect Nicaraguan economy, since Nicaragua cannot
                                    undertake the work itself and will not allow any other powerful
                                    foreign nation to do so. Meanwhile, the country suffers because
                                    of the lack of adequate transportation facilities for its
                                    development.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>If the United States does not wish to undertake construction
                                    of the canal at the present time, the Nicaraguan Government
                                    feels that it would be only fair if the United States would
                                    undertake the work of canalization of the San Juan River. This
                                    would mean a great deal to Nicaraguan economy. Some estimates of
                                    the cost of this <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0729"/>work
                                    have run from three to nine million dollars. The idea of the
                                    Nicaraguan Government is to negotiate a convention with the
                                    United States to provide for this work, and the cost would be
                                    deducted from payments made to Nicaragua in the event that an
                                    interocean canal eventually is constructed.</item>

                                <item>The new Nicaraguan constitution contains provisions which
                                    would cover the negotiation of a convention for the canalization
                                    work. Therefore, the Nicaraguan Government is most anxious that
                                    such a convention be negotiated in time to be submitted to the
                                    U. S. Senate during the coming session of Congress.</item>

                                    ample facilities for defense measures—ports, the use of air
                                    fields, transit of troops in case of necessity, etc.</item>

                                <item>The President of Nicaragua would like to come to Washington
                                    for a conversation with President Roosevelt in the event that an
                                    agreement with respect to the canalization of the San Juan River
                                    appears likely. (This, of course, would be a political move to
                                    strengthen the position of the Nicaraguan President in his own

                                    agreement between the United States and Nicaragua along the
                                    lines suggested would have a very favorable effect in the other

                        <p>I promised to bring the foregoing observations to the Secretary’s

                            him. I also reminded Dr. Cordero Reyes of his conversation in Lima with

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: The introduction in both
                            houses of the American Congress of bills looking to the construction of
                            a canal under the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty has given fresh impetus to
                            discussions of that project by the press and by government officials.
                            These matters have been fully reported, and I have made known also
                            President Somoza’s desire, as expressed to me in informal conversations
                            and more recently announced in the local newspapers, to visit Washington
                            at an early date with a view to urging action.</p>
                        <p>I have at no time expressed any opinion as to the proposed visit. Last
                            night at a dinner the President gave in honor of the Mexican <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0730"/>Ambassador to the United States he told
                            me, as most confidential, that the Nicaraguan Minister in Washington had
                            advised him that an invitation to visit Washington would be forthcoming
                            sometime in the spring—probably after the visit of King George.<note n="5" xml:id="d669fn5">King George VI of Great Britain visited the
                                United States in June 1939.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>In spite of President Somoza’s injunction of secrecy, I shall not be
                            surprised if this intelligence finds its way to the newspapers sooner or
                            later. It would be ungracious for me to express a doubt as to the
                            promise of an official invitation, but I think you should know that he
                            has spoken of this as having been arranged between Minister DeBayle and
                            the Department. I may add that the President yesterday told our naval
                            attaché for air exactly the same thing and with a similar injunction as
                            to its confidential nature.</p>
                        <p>I feel constrained to say that this subject has now assumed so great an
                            importance with Nicaragua and its government that President Somoza will
                            not easily be diverted from his purpose to press for action. If, as
                            seems likely, the Constituent Assembly extends his term of office he
                            undoubtedly expects to make the realization of the canal the great
                            achievement of his administration.</p>
                        <p>With best wishes,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Nicholson</hi>: I have received your
                            letter of January 14, 1939 with respect to the projected visit of
                            President Somoza to Washington. The President has indicated that he
                            would be very happy to receive President Somoza as his guest at the
                            White House on May 5, and the Nicaraguan Minister has been so informed.
                            The Protocol Division will prepare the program for the visit in
                            collaboration with Dr. Léon De Bayle. Until the visit is announced
                            officially, please consider this information as strictly
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that President Somoza hopes to obtain the assistance of
                            this Government in the project for the canalization of the San Juan
                            River as an alternative to the construction of the Interoceanic Canal
                            through Nicaragua. As you probably know, two resolutions have been
                            introduced into Congress providing for the construction of the
                            Nicaraguan Canal, but obviously there is no assurance that favorable
                            action on these resolutions will be forthcoming. Every effort <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0731"/>will be made prior to President
                            Somoza’s arrival here to determine what action, if any, it will be
                            possible to take in response to the request which has been made by the
                            Nicaraguan Government for assistance in the canalization of the San Juan
                            River. Here again it is of course impossible to forecast at this moment
                            the nature of the conclusions which will be reached.</p>
                        <p>In view of the uncertainties surrounding this situation, it is greatly to
                            be hoped that the Nicaraguan Government will not publicly interpret our
                            concurrence in the visit of President Somoza as an indication that
                            favorable action on either the construction of the Nicaraguan Canal or
                            the canalization of the San Juan River will be taken. If you have
                            occasion to discuss his visit with President Somoza I think that it
                            would be very desirable to suggest to him informally that the greatest
                            reserve on these questions should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>With my cordial best wishes, I am,</p>

                        <p>In accordance with arrangements made with the War and Navy Departments
                            with the approval of Mr. Welles, a conference was held to discuss the
                            proposed legislation for the construction of the Nicaraguan canal and
                            the construction of additional facilities in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of the War and Navy Departments indicated that the
                            reports of their Departments on the proposed legislation had not been
                            prepared and that they were not therefore in a position to state the
                            nature of the final recommendations on the legislation which would be
                            made.</p>
                        <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0732"/>
                        <p>General Strong pointed out that the estimated cost of the proposed
                            Nicaraguan canal of approximately three-fourths of a billion dollars
                            would probably reach a billion dollars if adequate defense arrangements
                            were made. It had been roughly estimated, on the other hand, that the
                            cost of an additional set of locks in the Canal Zone located a safe
                            distance away from the present locks would be approximately
                            $300,000,000. It was felt that the third set of locks and the connecting
                            channels would in effect provide a new canal which in time of emergency
                            could be reserved for the use of American public and merchant vessels,
                            which would eliminate the danger of sabotage by a foreign or neutral
                            merchant vessel while transiting the existing lock system.</p>
                        <p>The conversation also included discussion of the present and proposed
                            defense system for the Panama Canal, with particular reference to the
                            danger of attack from the air. The difficulties involved in the defense
                            of a second canal through Nicaraguan territory were also discussed.</p>
                        <p>The officers present were asked their opinion with regard to the possible
                            strategic value of the Nicaraguan project for the canalization of the
                            San Juan River. General Strong did not appear to consider the project as
                            of any great strategic value but agreed to go into the matter
                            further.</p>
                        <p>After further general discussion of the strategic and financial
                            considerations affecting the proposed legislation, it was agreed that a
                            draft of the reply of this Department to Congressman Bland<note n="9" xml:id="d671fn9">Schuyler Otis Bland, Representative from

                            Departments in order to avoid any conflict in the recommendations
                            submitted.</p>

                            something tangible may emerge from our conversations which will be of

                        <p>I have given careful consideration to your suggestions for the purchase
                            of the Corn Islands by this Government. While this idea has been found
                            of interest, I doubt that the Congress would give its approval to the
                            purchase of these islands when they are already under a long-term lease
                            to this Government.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I desire to express the sincere
                            thanks of the Republic of Nicaragua for the many courtesies and the
                            cordial hospitality which I have received during my visit in this
                            country from the Government over which Your Excellency so worthily
                            presides. The people and Government of Nicaragua are grateful to the
                            United States for these significant evidences of friendship and mutual
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>The opportunity of knowing Your Excellency has been a source of real
                            satisfaction to me and it has enabled me to confirm the impression which
                            I had formed of your brilliant personality and your sincere and noble
                            devotion to the ideals of Pan Americanism as well as your friendly
                            sentiments toward my country.</p>
                        <p>I have been happy to tell you that we in Nicaragua have faith and
                            confidence in our strength and ability to develop our country, to
                            improve our agricultural possibilities, our mines and our small
                            industries, to raise the standard of living and to advance our cultural
                            attainments. But we realize that in an age of increasing specialization
                            and interdependence we can utilize advantageously the counsel and
                            friendly assistance of our neighbors, just as our aid and cooperation is
                            useful to them. In this spirit of mutual helpfulness, I have thought it
                            desirable to set forth certain of the objectives of my Government of
                            interest to the United States in order to ascertain the possibilities of
                            cooperation in our common benefit. I am hopeful that your consideration
                            of these objectives will disclose ways and means in which we can
                            cooperate for their attainment.</p>

                        <p>Adequate transportation facilities are a prime requisite to the
                            development of the production and trade of a nation. It is the opinion
                            of the Government of Nicaragua that it is of paramount importance to
                            link together the productive regions of the east coast of Nicaragua with
                            the more densely populated productive regions of the interior and <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0734"/>the Pacific coast, and to
                            provide a more direct channel of communication for commerce between
                            Nicaragua and the United States. This objective could effectively be
                            attained by the canalization of the San Juan River for vessels of
                            moderate draft and if possible, by a complementary waterway from Lake
                            Nicaragua to the Pacific. I desire to inquire whether the assistance of
                            the Government of the United States might be extended to assist my
                            Government in the realization of this project. Specifically it would be
                            necessary in any event as a first step to have precise surveys and
                            estimates, and I am hopeful that it will be feasible for the Government
                            of the United States to send engineers of the United States Engineer
                            Corps for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>Nicaragua also greatly needs additional transportation facilities in the

                            proposed Pan American Highway through Nicaragua, part of which has
                            already been surveyed and a portion built by the Nicaraguan Government

                            principal producing areas of the Republic. To this end, the Government
                            of Nicaragua requests the loan of the services of engineers of the
                            Bureau of Public Roads for engineering advice and supervision, and the
                            extension of credit facilities to finance the purchase from United

                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>I consider that the development of the foreign commerce of Nicaragua and
                            of economic relations between Nicaragua and the United States will be
                            facilitated by the prompt payment at all times of commercial obligations
                            to United States nationals and concerns, and by the elimination of
                            unusual fluctuations in the rate of exchange of the cordoba and those
                            arising out of the irregular timing of international in-and
                            out-payments. The problem of the former accumulated commercial
                            arrearages has been solved within the limits of Nicaragua’s economic
                            resources in an agreement concluded with the National Foreign Trade

                            credit in United States currency to the National Bank of Nicaragua would
                            be desirable.</p>

                        <p>Nicaragua is especially desirous of encouraging the large-scale
                            production of suitable non-competitive agricultural products which will
                            complement production and find a market in the United States. My

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have received with great
                            satisfaction Your Excellency’s communication of May 22, 1939 expressing
                            appreciation for the courtesies which it has been possible to extend to
                            you in the course of your visit in the United States. Needless to say it
                            has been a very real pleasure for us to have had the opportunity of
                            knowing you and of hearing from you the expressions of the sincere
                            friendship of the Government and people of Nicaragua for this country. I
                            fully share Your Excellency’s conviction that increased cooperation
                            between two friendly neighbors will further the common interests of this
                            hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>I have noted with special interest the statement of the objectives of
                            your Government of promoting the development of mutually beneficial
                            economic relations between Nicaragua and the United States, and
                            developing the national economy and natural resources of Nicaragua. As
                            you well know, the Government of the United States is greatly desirous
                            of taking any steps possible in order to continue and expand the
                            economic cooperation between Nicaragua and the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>The objective of Your Government of providing adequate transportation
                            facilities as a major step toward the development of production and
                            foreign commerce of the nation appears to me to be entirely sound.</p>
                        <p>Regarding your suggestion for the canalization of the San Juan River for
                            vessels of moderate draft, I have been pleased to instruct the United
                            States Army Engineer Corps to make the necessary studies and surveys of
                            a canalization and highway project to link the eastern and western
                            regions of Nicaragua. I am impressed with the thought that such a
                            project would very greatly facilitate and expedite communications
                            between your country and mine and by opening new areas to the production
                            of complementary non-competitive products would provide new bases for an
                            increase in commerce between those areas and the United States.
                            Moreover, it is obvious that should occasion arise, the existence of
                            such a waterway would have a very important bearing upon the defense of
                            the hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the necessary financial arrangements can be made in this
                            country, a board of four officers of the Corps of Engineers, accompanied
                            by an official of the United States Engineer Department and an officer
                            of the Army Medical Corps will be sent to Nicaragua. It is <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0737"/>expected that the board would leave for
                            Nicaragua next July and would be able to carry out the studies of the
                            project within a few months. Upon the basis of their reports we can take
                            such further action as seems in the common interest of our two
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the United States is also pleased to cooperate in the
                            construction of certain sections of the proposed Pan American Highway,
                            useful lateral feeder roads, and other projects. In order to expedite
                            this construction, I am prepared to detail under the authority of Public
                            No. 63<note n="14" xml:id="d674fn14">Approved May 3, 1939; 53 Stat.

                            of Public Roads for temporary service with the Nicaraguan Government for
                            engineering advice and supervision. Moreover, the Export-Import Bank of
                            Washington will assist in arranging certain credits to finance the
                            purchase of United States equipment, materials and services for the
                            construction of highways and other productive projects.</p>

                        <p>I am in the fullest accord with Your Excellency’s opinion that expansion
                            of economic relations between Nicaragua and the United States will be
                            facilitated by the prompt payment at all times of commercial obligations
                            to United States nationals and concerns, and by the elimination of
                            unusual fluctuations in the rate of exchange of the cordoba and those
                            arising out of the irregular timing of international in-and
                            out-payments. The Export-Import Bank will assist in the attainment of
                            this objective by the extension to the National Bank of Nicaragua of a
                            credit. A copy of a communication in regard to these matters addressed
                            to you by the President of the Export-Import Bank is enclosed as

                            complement production in the United States. As you are aware,
                            legislation has already been enacted which authorizes the loan of

                            agricultural studies and developments, and suitable provisions are under
                            consideration to enable the Government of the United States to undertake
                            surveys of agricultural resources of foreign countries and assistance in

                            communication of this date to the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank of Washington will undertake either directly or
                            through United States commercial banks to provide credits for the
                            National Bank of Nicaragua in order to assist it to attain the expressed
                            objectives of the Government of Nicaragua of encouraging the development
                            of Nicaraguan foreign commerce and economic relations with the United
                            States by meeting promptly at all times commercial obligations to United
                            States nationals and concerns and eliminating unusual fluctuations in
                            the rate of exchange of the cordoba and those resulting from the
                            seasonality of major export crops. The total amount of such credits
                            shall not exceed $500,000 at any one time, and such credits are to be
                            utilized from time to time as required prior to June 30, 1941.</p>
                        <p>To permit the National Bank of Nicaragua ample opportunity to liquidate
                            its obligations under the credit it is proposed that each availment
                            thereunder shall be payable in equal quarterly installments during a
                            period not exceeding thirty-six months, and the rate of interest shall
                            be 3.6% per annum. Details and other conditions of the transaction will
                            hereafter be arranged between the Export-Import Bank and the National
                            Bank of Nicaragua, but it shall be understood that all obligations under
                            this arrangement shall be liquidated on or before June 30, 1944.
                            Availments under the line of credit shall have <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0739"/>the approval of the National Bank of
                            Nicaragua and the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>To aid in improving Nicaragua’s transportation facilities and the
                            development of other projects designed to increase the productive
                            capacity of the Nicaraguan people and their trade with the United
                            States, the Export-Import Bank will cooperate with United States
                            manufacturers and exporters and with the Nicaraguan Government in
                            arranging for the financing in the United States of equipment, materials
                            and technical services not available in Nicaragua. It is envisaged that
                            the construction program may entail the extension of credits by the
                            Export-Import Bank of as much as $2,000,000 prior to June 30, 1941.</p>
                        <p>We are informed that available engineers of the Bureau of Public Roads
                            will be detailed by the President to the Government of Nicaragua to
                            furnish engineering advice and supervision, but that in order to carry
                            on the proposed construction, they must be supplemented by the
                            employment by the Government of Nicaragua in agreement with the
                            Export-Import Bank of additional engineers and other technical
                            assistants.</p>
                        <p>We understand that individual expenditures under the construction program
                            shall follow examination of the feasibility and utility of particular
                            projects and certification as to their necessity by the Government of
                            Nicaragua and the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>To permit the improvements under consideration to be carried forward as
                            rapidly as is consistent with sound financial policy it is contemplated
                            that the credits will take the form of discounting, under conditions to
                            be agreed upon by the Government of Nicaragua and the Export-Import
                            Bank, of serial notes to be issued from time to time by the Government
                            of Nicaragua bearing interest at the rate of 5% per annum and maturing
                            over a period of seven years.</p>
                        <p>During the time the Export-Import Bank is in position to assist in
                            providing or arranging for these credits, and to the extent that its
                            funds may be available for this purpose it will be pleased to cooperate
                            as indicated above with the Government of Nicaragua.</p>

                                    further consideration of the construction of the Nicaraguan
                                    canal. I said, furthermore, that the estimates presented to the
                                    President by the engineers of the War Department for the
                                    construction of the Nicaraguan inter-oceanic canal had been so
                                    huge as to make it impracticable for this government at this
                                    time to give any further consideration to the question on the
                                    ground of the expense involved quite apart from other
                                    considerations.</p>
                                <p>I stated that President Somoza had then urged upon this
                                    Government an agreement between Nicaragua and the United States
                                    whereby the Government of the United States would provide the
                                    Government of Nicaragua with funds sufficient to make possible
                                    as a project of the Nicaraguan Government, and under its
                                    control, the canalization of the San Juan River so that the
                                    River might be used as a barge canal with the further
                                    possibility of opening a barge canal between the Lake of
                                    Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean through the Isthmus of Rivas. I
                                    said that this matter had been given very detailed consideration
                                    by the President and that he had reached the decision in
                                    agreement with President Somoza to lend to the Government of
                                    Nicaragua the services of a group of Army engineers of the
                                    United States for the purpose of making a study and report upon
                                    the cost which would be incurred by the Government of Nicaragua
                                    through the canalization of the San Juan River and through the
                                    creation of a barge canal from the Lake of Nicaragua to the
                                    Pacific Ocean. I said that the Minister would clearly understand
                                    that the commitment of the United States went no further and
                                    that all that was now in mind was the preparation of this report
                                    and estimates.</p>
                                <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0742"/>
                                <p>I said that throughout the negotiations this Government had borne
                                    clearly in mind the rights of the Government of Costa Rica in so
                                    far as the River San Juan was concerned and that both the
                                    President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua in
                                    their conversations with officials of this Government have
                                    repeatedly recognized the rights of Costa Rica in this
                                    regard.</p>
                                <p>I said, therefore, that it was the desire of the President that
                                    the Government of Costa Rica be informed fully of this fact and
                                    that it should be further advised that in the event that the
                                    study and report and the estimates prepared by these engineers
                                    for the Government of Nicaragua made it appear that the
                                    canalization of the San Juan River and the construction of a
                                    barge canal through the Lake of Nicaragua to the Pacific Ocean
                                    were feasible, nothing further would be done by this Government
                                    in the matter until and unless the Government of Costa Rica and
                                    the Government of Nicaragua reached an agreement covering the
                                    projected canalization of the River San Juan. In that event, I
                                    said, a convention would have subsequently to be concluded
                                    between the United States and the Government of Nicaragua for
                                    submission to the Senate of the United States in order that
                                    ratification by the Senate might be obtained. I stated that in
                                    this manner it would seem to me very clear that the rights of
                                    Costa Rica would be fully protected and that the Government of
                                    Costa Rica would be free to reach its own decision as to its
                                    wishes in the matter. I said that the general idea had been
                                    given favorable consideration by this Government because of our
                                    belief that the canalization of the River and the construction
                                    of the barge canal would open up to profitable development the
                                    interior regions both of Nicaragua and of Costa Rica and would
                                    greatly facilitate and stimulate trade between the United States
                                    and the two neighboring republics. I said further that if the
                                    barge canal were completed between the Pacific and the Atlantic
                                    Oceans, such a canal would undoubtedly be of considerable
                                    service from the standpoint of continental military defense.</p>
                                <p>The Minister expressed his very great appreciation of the
                                    information I had given him. He said that he had not approached
                                    me in the matter because of the entire confidence which his
                                    Government and he himself had that this Government would give
                                    full recognition to the legitimate rights of Costa Rica. He said
                                    that, of course, under the arrangements I explained to him, the
                                    United States itself would not be undertaking the work involved
                                    but that the work would rather be undertaken by the Government
                                    of Nicaragua itself with financial assistance provided by the
                                    United States. He said that consequently the arrangements to be
                                    reached with regard to their respective rights in the San Juan
                                    River would have to be reached directly between Nicaragua and
                                    Costa Rica and that because of the very friendly relations
                                    existing between the two present Governments, he anticipated no
                                    difficulty on that score. The Minister asked if I could give him
                                    technical information as to the size of the vessels which would
                                    be enabled to transverse the contemplated barge canal and I said
                                    that none of these details had been determined or even discussed
                                    and that all that the engineers would be required to report upon
                                    would be the compilation of two alternative estimates, one
                                    estimating for the construction of a barge canal for vessels of
                                    10-foot draft and the other estimate for vessels of 12-foot
                                    draft.”</p>

                            what was agreed upon here with two exceptions.</p>

                            volition, agreed that if the survey of the canal route proved that a
                            feasible shallow draft barge canal could be constructed, he would then
                            proceed to negotiate a supplementary treaty with Nicaragua providing for
                            the construction of the canal at the expense of this Government, the
                            money so expended to be deducted from the payment to Nicaragua if, as,
                            and when a deep-water interoceanic canal is constructed. The Nicaraguans
                            naturally were overjoyed with the President’s intentions and act as
                            though the barge canal was as good as already agreed upon. Personally I
                            have a feeling that this barge canal will not be built in the immediate
                            future, regardless of what the survey may show. There is very healthy
                            skepticism in many political quarters here as to the utility of
                            expending the necessary funds for a barge canal. A treaty possibly might
                            not secure the necessary two-thirds vote.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the barge canal, the Nicaraguans were informed that if the
                            survey shows it to be practicable and before any supplementary agreement
                            is negotiated, this Government will have to be assured that any rights
                            which Costa Rica has, have been adequately safeguarded. This naturally
                            implies prior negotiations with the Costa Ricans. The Nicaraguans have
                            vigorously protested against this and may continue to work on you trying
                            to convince you that they can take care of the Costa Ricans. If they do,
                            might I venture to suggest that you take a rather strong line with them
                            and maintain the Department’s position that it cannot proceed with any
                            arrangements until it knows for itself that the Costa Ricans are
                            satisfied. I think that you will agree that it is obvious that we do not
                            wish to get into a dispute <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0744"/>with
                            Costa Rica because of any construction works that may be undertaken in
                            Nicaragua. We certainly cannot rely on the Nicaraguans to get together
                            with the Costa Ricans. We will have to ascertain for ourselves that the
                            Costa Ricans are agreeable to the construction of a barge canal and that
                            whatever rights they have have been taken into account and
                            satisfied.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, President Somoza objected strenuously to contracting
                            the services of a financial expert at this time. This was originally
                            laid down as a condition for the attainment of the Export-Import Bank
                            credit. The President explained at considerable length that Nicaraguan
                            public opinion had become antagonistic to foreign financial experts …
                            The President stated that he would like to have a financial adviser and
                            that he intended to request one he hoped within two or three months as
                            soon as the aroused public opinion had calmed down, but that he could
                            not do so at the moment.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank is now looking around for a capable man to serve
                            as chief engineer. This chief engineer will really be the high mogul so
                            far as the construction activities are concerned.</p>
                        <p>So far as I know, President Somoza and his troop left here satisfied with
                            what they had obtained.</p>
                        <p>With kindest regards to Mrs. Nicholson and to you,</p>
                        <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 24 of May 22, 7 p.m., and to report as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was not in his office on the date of
                            receipt of the same, but I obtained an appointment for Thursday. On this
                            occasion the substance of the entire instruction was submitted point by
                            point, but in accordance with instructions, no memorandum thereof was
                            left with the Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Minister expressed himself as being highly gratified that the
                            Government of the United States respected the rights of his country in
                            the San Juan River and that President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull had
                            been courteous enough to request me to confirm assurances on that point
                            which had already been communicated to him by both cable and airmail by
                            the Costa Rican Minister to Washington.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then stated that the information which I had imparted to him
                            on various other phases of the situation coincided with the data which
                            he had obtained through Mr. Castro Beeche. He added to the <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0745"/>above statement that his Government at
                            no time had the slightest doubt as to the position of our Government as

                            clear indication of the viewpoint of Washington.</p>
                        <p>He stated that Costa Rica looked with favor upon the canalization of the
                            San Juan River and owing to the friendly relations actually existing
                            between the Liberal Government of General Somoza and Costa Rica this
                            Government did not believe that any difficulty would be encountered in
                            reaching an agreement. He recognized the advantages that might be
                            derived by Costa Rica should this project be undertaken but raised the
                            following question: The Colorado delta is entirely on the Costa Rican
                            side, he said, and should the projected canalization of the San Juan
                            River be carried out in a manner that would adversely affect the delta,
                            this might become the subject of a dispute between Nicaragua and Costa
                            Rica which could possibly prolong or even defeat the negotiations. He
                            added, however, that he did not believe it would 3tand in the way of an
                            amicable arrangement between the two countries.</p>

                            18. He offered to give me a copy of the draft treaty regarding
                            canalization which he will use as a basis for discussions suggesting
                            that I might send copy to Hornibrook, to aid in case of need. I made no

                                    vessels for account of Nicaragua. Nicaragua declares this does
                                    not imply cession of territory and will continue complete
                                    sovereignty and control of the works to be turned over for use

                        <p>Cordero Reyes pointed out that they will not indicate to Costa Rica what
                            aid the United States is to extend and that publicly the accord will
                            rest on the Somoza–Roosevelt letters. The entire agreement offers Costa
                            Rica in rights of navigation much more than Costa Rica is requested to
                            give in rights in the Colorado and fully protects her sovereignty. No
                            mention will be made of the Nicaraguan proposal which he said was
                            discussed at Washington for American troops et cetera, to use the route
                            in time of war and the construction of four landing fields. Costa Rica
                            will doubtless demand the right of navigating the Lake of Nicaragua

                            to the Pacific. He foresees a request to divert the Colorado via the
                            Tortugurro lagoons which Nicaragua cannot accept either for itself or
                            because of possible danger to a future interoceanic canal.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that both countries remained free and in <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi> insofar as their rights to obtain settlement
                            from the United States in the event of a future interoceanic canal.
                            Nicaragua under the Washington Agreement will consider the present
                            project as advance payment by the United States toward a future
                            settlement.</p>

                        <p>55. Please inform the appropriate officials of the Government of
                            Nicaragua that in accordance with the terms of section 1, paragraph 3 of
                            the letter of May 22, 1939 from the President to President Somoza a
                            board of eight officers and employees of the Corps of Engineers, United
                            States Army, and the United States Engineer Department, under the
                            command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles P. Gross, will leave New York en
                            route to Nicaragua on August 10 on the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Panama</hi>. Two members of the board will arrive in Corinto by
                            steamship from Panama about August 25, and the remainder of the party
                            will proceed from Panama to Managua on a United States army plane on
                            August 20. Names of the members of the board will be sent to you by air
                            mail in order that appropriate arrangements can be made in connection
                            with their arrival.</p>
                        <p>The expenses of the mission and the cost of preparation of its report in
                            connection with the proposed canalization will be paid from an
                            appropriation of $100,000 which has now been made available by the
                            Congress for this purpose. For your confidential information it is hoped
                            that additional funds for the completion of the report may be
                            appropriated by the Congress at a later time if it should be necessary.
                            It is expected that the present appropriation will be adequate to
                            complete the work of the mission in the field.</p>

                        <list>
                            <item>Article 1. The text of this article indicates that there has been

                                out the canalization project. It is believed that the article should

                                make it clear that the canalization project is at present only under
                                study. Its completion is dependent on (1) the results of the studies
                                shortly to be undertaken by a board of officers of the United States
                                Engineer Corps; (2) the conclusion between the United States and
                                Nicaragua of a treaty or agreement for the canalization project
                                which would of course be subject to approval by the United States
                                Senate; and (3) appropriation by the Congress of the United States

                                articles the right to grant the privilege of free navigation of the
                                port and river of San Juan and Lake Nicaragua to vessels of the
                                United States. However, you should not make this proposal to the

                            of negotiations between Costa Rica and Nicaragua with regard to the
                            proposed treaty for the canalization of the San Juan River, the
                            Department would not wish to authorize Colonel Gross to proceed to San
                            José unless his presence there should be considered essential for the
                            purpose of furnishing the Costa Rican authorities with technical
                            information of an engineering nature. It would be preferable in any
                            event to furnish this information if possible through the Nicaraguan
                            Government or by correspondence, as it is desired to avoid even the
                            appearance that we are participating in any way in the negotiations. In
                            this connection you are reminded of the memorandum of conversation

                        <p>119. Telegraphic instruction No. 75, October 3. The proposed visit of the
                            Canal Commission to San José has long been announced in both Nicaragua
                            and Costa Rica and I believe that canceling it at this time would be
                            misinterpreted and would cause undesirable comment. While I have not of
                            course requested Nicaraguan opinion with regard to the visit I am sure
                            this Government has no objection but would on the contrary recommend
                            that the visit be made.</p>
                        <p>As already reported Colonel Gross takes the position that his
                            instructions do not cover the preparation and presentation of a
                            memorandum to the Costa Rican Government or its representatives.</p>
                        <p>The economic information normally included in an engineering report of
                            the character to be presented would necessitate long preparation and the
                            visit of the mission to San José would include indicating to officials
                            there the type and character of the information desired but it would not
                            be a primary object of the trip.</p>
                        <p>The mission desires also to acquaint itself with the general geographic
                            and economic conditions prevailing in each country as it has already
                            done in Nicaragua by extensive visits to outstanding cities and the
                            different geographical sections of the country including the east
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>I should like to recommend that I be instructed to inform Colonel Gross
                            of your desire to avoid even the appearance of participation in any way
                            in the negotiations between the two countries and that the reasons for
                            his visit to San José would be only to furnish technical information of
                            an engineering nature and to explain what economic information he
                            requires. The mission returns to Managua Monday from Puerto Cabezas.</p>

                        <p>77. In view of the considerations set forth in your telegram no. 119,
                            October 6, 5 p.m., you are requested to inform Colonel Gross that the
                            proposed visit of the Commission to San José is approved. Please <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0750"/>inform him that it is the
                            understanding of this Department that the purpose of his visit is to
                            make available to the Costa Rican Government technical information of an
                            engineering nature with regard to the proposed canalization and to
                            indicate to the Costa Rican Government through the American Legation in
                            San José information of an economic nature which he desires to obtain.
                            You should also explain to Colonel Gross that this Department wishes to
                            avoid even the appearance that we are participating in any way in the
                            current negotiations between the Governments of Costa Rica and
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing has been repeated to the American Legation in San José for
                            the information and guidance of the Minister.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 56 of October 7,<note n="26" xml:id="d686fn26">This telegram repeated telegram No. 77, October 7,
                                3 p.m., to the Minister in Nicaragua, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> and to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>Colonel Charles P. Gross and his party of army engineers arrived here on
                            October 19. On the following day I presented the Colonel and three other
                            army engineers to the Minister of Foreign Affairs with the idea that
                            they would pay their respects, exchange a few pleasantries and depart.
                            The Foreign Minister, however, immediately launched into a discussion of
                            the canalization project, produced a map and requested Colonel Gross to
                            outline the proposed route of the canal project. The explanation lasted
                            for an hour and three quarters with the result, I think, that many
                            phases of the situation were clarified in the mind of the Foreign
                            Minister. In fact at a cocktail party the night following, he informed
                            me that the explanation had been satisfactory. I did not participate in
                            the discussion, at the Foreign Office, nor did I discuss the treaty
                            negotiations or technical details at the cocktail party the following
                            evening.</p>
                        <p>On the same afternoon I took the group of officers to President Leon
                            Cortés to pay their respects. They were received most cordially and the
                            President expressed a keen interest in the proposed project. He stated,
                            however, that he was not competent to pass upon the technical matters
                            confronting the American engineers and therefore designated Mr.
                            Francisco Pacheco, Minister of Public Works and a graduate of an
                            American engineering school, as his representative for the purpose of
                            obtaining information as to the plans thus far outlined by Colonel
                            Gross.</p>
                        <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0751"/>
                        <p>I may state in connection with both of the above-mentioned interviews
                            Colonel Gross at no time expressed an opinion as to proposed
                            negotiations, and confined his remarks and explanations exclusively to
                            the technical points involved. He did make it plain, however, that he
                            did not come to San José with the idea of “selling” the project to Costa
                            Rica, but merely to aid the Government by explaining the engineering
                            problems. He also requested certain economic information from the
                            President who promised to provide the same.</p>
                        <p>On October 21 Mr. Cordero Reyes arrived from Managua with a new draft
                            treaty. It has heretofore been stated in the press that he would not
                            return unless he received an official invitation from the Costa Rican
                            Government, and, as far as I have been able to ascertain, no such
                            invitation was extended. I have not as yet seen Mr. Cordero Reyes, but
                            assume that when I do he will perhaps discuss this feature of his
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>The Nicaraguan Foreign Minister will in all probability not be able to
                            have any extended talks with the American engineers during their brief
                            visit here for the reason that the Costa Rican Government has arranged
                            for trips which will consume most of the remaining days of their visit.
                            The officers, however, will be in the company of Mr. Pacheco and will
                            have ample time to discuss engineering problems. They plan to leave here
                            on October 26.</p>

                            Solorzano, Nicaraguan Minister to Costa Rica, called by appointment at
                            my residence on November 25 for the purpose of advising me as to the
                            progress of their negotiations with the Costa Rican Government on the
                            canalization project. Both seemed to be rather depressed as to the
                            prospects of an early agreement, and the former stated that in the event
                            he held another conference with the Minister for Foreign Affairs he
                            proposed to suggest an agreement on the proposals which he had
                            heretofore submitted, with a proviso that they should not come into
                            legal operation until such time as the Costa Rican Government had had an
                            opportunity to study the final report of the American engineers. He
                            stated that the only objection which had thus far been voiced by the
                            Costa Rican Foreign Minister or the President <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0752"/>had been the fact that Colonel Gross
                            was not in a position on the date of his visit to San José to give
                            detailed information as to the project. The Colonel stated to officials
                            here that he would not be able to give out additional information until
                            such time as his final report had been submitted to the War Department
                            and later released as a public document.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cordero Reyes again pointed out that the contention of his government
                            is that Costa Rica has no legal right to oppose the project under
                            existing treaties and asserted that under a clause in one of those pacts
                            signed in 1850 Nicaragua has a right to proceed with the construction
                            and pay the slight damages which might possibly be awarded to Costa Rica
                            for minor losses as a result of flooding a small portion of her
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>On November 25 I again met Dr. Cordero Reyes at a cocktail party and he
                            stated that it now seemed to be definitely plain Costa Rica would not
                            sign a treaty until such time as Colonel Gross had completed his report
                            and the results made known to the officials of the government. He stated
                            he had again urged upon the local authorities, that the project must be
                            agreed upon between Costa Rica and Nicaragua before the end of the
                            Roosevelt administration in order to insure congressional support in the
                            United States, but was told that until Costa Rica obtained the necessary
                            technical information from Colonel Gross it could hardly be expected to
                            enter into an agreement which might adversely affect its material
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cordero Reyes asserted that in his opinion Max Effinger, German
                            naturalized Costa Rican now employed in the Ministry of Public Works as
                            an engineer, had considerable to do with the attitude of the Costa Rican
                            Government. He asserted that Effinger has unquestionably raised a large
                            number of technical questions as to possible damage to Costa Rican lands
                            in close proximity to the project.</p>
                        <p>Press comments have been made from day to day in all local newspapers,
                            but as they appear to confirm the remarks made to me by Dr. Cordero
                            Reyes I shall not include them as enclosures.</p>

                        <p>On December 8, Dr. Cordero Reyes, Minister for Foreign Affairs of
                            Nicaragua, and Mr. Mena Solórzano, Minister to Costa Rica from the same
                            country, called for the purpose of requesting me to expedite the
                            delivery of the report of Colonel Gross as to the proposed work on the
                            Costa Rican side of the project.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Reyes pointed out at this conversation that in the viewpoint of his
                            own country it is unimportant to receive the report of the proposed work
                            on the Nicaraguan side at this time, but that it is highly important to
                            satisfy Costa Rica as to just what damage, if any, may be caused to
                            Costa Rican territory. He stated that in his opinion, if the State
                            Department made the suggestion, it would be quite possible the War
                            Department might instruct Colonel Gross to confine his present work to a
                            study of the Costa Rican side and submit the same as an independent
                            document at a very early date to his superior officers and this partial
                            report could be promptly submitted to the Costa Rican Foreign Office and
                            thus speed up the signing of the treaty. He again expressed the fear
                            that in the event President Roosevelt concluded to decline a third term
                            his successor in office might not be as friendly to the project and
                            therefore felt that it should be pushed through before the expiration of
                            his term of office.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversation Dr. Reyes stated that he had
                            intended to leave the early part of the same week, but Mr. Martinez, the
                            President’s private secretary, had called upon him and requested that he
                            remain in San José until the President returned from Punt-arenas for the
                            purpose of holding another conference on the treaty negotiations. This,
                            Dr. Reyes, stated he agreed to do, but up until the date of the
                            conversation he had received no summons to confer with either the
                            President or the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>He also stated that he had conferred by long distance telephone with the
                            Nicaraguan Minister to Washington as to the Castro Beeche cablegram in
                            which Undersecretary Sumner Welles was quoted as saying that the latter
                            was in accord with the Costa Rican viewpoint with respect to postponing
                            final action until after the report of Colonel Gross had been received
                            in San José. He asserted that his Minister had assured him that he was
                            certain Mr. Castro Beeche had not properly explained the Nicaraguan
                            viewpoint as to the alleged thirty days ultimatum, and that this
                            accounted for any statements which might have been made by Secretary
                            Welles on the date of the interview. He explained again that he had sent
                            no ultimatum to the Costa Rican Government, but that he had referred to
                            a section in the treaty of 1858<note n="29" xml:id="d688fn29">Signed

                                1049.</note> wherein Nicaragua obtained the legal right to commence
                            work on the proposed canal upon thirty days notice, and that his country
                            is prepared to pay the damages, if any, which might be suffered <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0754"/>by Costa Rica in the event that
                            this clause should be invoked by Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>On December 11 Dr. Cordero Reyes and the Nicaraguan Minister again called
                            by appointment. Both of them were manifestly depressed and somewhat
                            disillusioned. Dr. Reyes stated that he had been recalled from his
                            mission by President Somoza and intended to leave by air for Managua on
                            the following morning. He asserted that despite the assurances given by
                            the President’s private secretary to the effect President Cortés desired
                            to receive him for the purpose of consulting again in regard to the
                            proposed treaty, no call for such consultation had been received nor had
                            he been asked to consult with the Costa Rican Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs during the past week. He stated that both President Somoza and
                            himself regarded this as a discourtesy to their Government, and the
                            latter was manifestly displeased with his treatment by Costa Rican
                            officials since the date of his arrival.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cordero Reyes stated he felt it of very great importance to the
                            success of the negotiations that Colonel Gross speed up his report on
                            the project insofar as the same might effect Costa Rican interests and
                            if he requested the State Department to expedite the matter to the end
                            that he might return to San José and resume the negotiations. He added
                            that without a report as to the Costa Rican side of the border he felt
                            it would be futile to continue the conversations further with this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Neither Dr. Cordero Reyes or the Nicaraguan Minister have any ill feeling
                            towards our own Government. On the contrary they are most friendly, but
                            they are both rather bitter as to the present attitude of Costa Rica.
                            The latter has made one or two unfortunate statements which I am
                            inclined to believe have reached the ears of local government officials
                            and have not tended to promote an early settlement of the treaty
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Both Dr. Cordero Reyes and the Minister stated on one or two occasions
                            that in the event Costa Rica did not see fit to sign the proposed treaty
                            their Government proposed to proceed under the treaty of 1858, and the
                            Cleveland award. In other words, that they would build the barge canal
                            and pay Costa Rica such damages as might be found just and equitable,
                            presumably to be determined by arbitration.</p>
                        <p>While Dr. Cordero Reyes did not say so in so many words I gathered from
                            his conversation that President Somoza is bitter in his remarks about
                            President Cortes and his treatment of his Foreign Minister during the
                            period of the negotiations. The recall of Dr. Cordero Reyes appears to
                            confirm the intimation that I received on this subject during our
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that both President Cortés and Dr. Calderón Guardia, the
                            latter almost certain to succeed as President, have privately stated
                            they approve of the treaty, political considerations on <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0755"/>the eve of the approaching election
                            have made it rather hazardous for them to proceed with the negotiations,
                            at least until such time as the report of Colonel Gross confirms the
                            statement of Dr. Cordero Reyes that the material interests of Costa Rica
                            will not be adversely affected.</p>

                            <p>[A treaty between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the canalization
                                of the San Juan River was signed April 5, 1940. In a letter of
                                January 31, 1941 (817.812/993), the Secretary of War informed the
                                Under Secretary of State that after work for the report of the Corps
                                of Engineers on this project had been completed in December 1940, he
                                had reported the facts to President Roosevelt at a Cabinet meeting.
                                The President then said he no longer desired the completion of the
                                report. The project was indefinitely postponed, apparently because
                                of the excessive cost and lack of sufficient economic or political

                            called my attention to the provisions regarding the employment of
                            Americans found in the new locks bill.<note n="2" xml:id="d691fn2">Public Law 391 (H. R. 5129), approved August 11, 1939; 53 Stat.
                                1409.</note> He said that these provisions have caused a painful
                            impression here as excluding Panamanians from desirable employment. He
                            said that this seems contrary to the letter and spirit of the
                                treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d691fn3">General Treaty of Friendship and
                                Cooperation and exchange of notes, signed at Washington, March 2,

                                signed March 2, 1936 and ratified July 27, 1939 is an exchange of
                                notes between the two Governments by which the United States has
                                agreed to maintain as a principle of public policy the opportunity
                                for employment and treatment in employment of Panamanian citizens
                                which is set forth in the Order and Executive Orders noted
                                above.</p>
                            <p>A provision of H. R. 5129 authorizing and providing for the
                                construction of additional facilities on the Canal Zone, etc.,
                                provides “that all new personnel in such construction work occupying
                                skilled, technical, clerical, administrative, and supervisory
                                positions shall be citizens of the United States”. It is my opinion
                                that this provision is at variance with the policy to which this
                                Government pledged itself in its note to the Government of Panama of
                                March 2, 1936, the date of the signing of the General Treaty, since
                                the Order and Executive Orders specifically provided equal
                                opportunities for employment for Panamanian citizens in the very
                                categories in which employment would be denied them under the quoted
                                provision of H. R. 5129.</p>
                            <p>The new Treaty was negotiated to provide a firm basis for friendly
                                and effective collaboration between the two Governments in order
                                that the Canal might fulfill in the most ample sense its functions.
                                With the exchange of ratifications of that Treaty, the United States
                                and Panama entered into a new stage of their relationship. This
                                relationship will be advantageous and enduring to the extent that
                                each party cooperates loyally and fully in the observance not only
                                of the letter but of the spirit of that Treaty.</p>

                            <p>I am giving my approval to this important bill which by authorizing

                                communication No. 53 of the 23rd instant, with which you were good

                                legislators of his country of the precedents which for over thirty
                                years <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0760"/>have guided the

                                particular the principle of equality of treatment between
                                Panamanians and Americans in the Canal Zone.</p>
                            <p>This Government is confident that the statement of the President of
                                the United States will bring about shortly the effect desired and
                                that the American legislators will respond to the appeal made to
                                them by the Chief Executive of that great country not to depart from
                                the norms of justice and equity which have inspired in this respect
                                the Public Administration of the United States nor from the
                                commitments entered into by the Department of State with the
                                Panamanian Negotiators, as is of record in the minutes of session
                                No. 107 held in Washington, on February 1, 1936, at 11 a.m.</p>
                            <p>I shall be grateful if Your Excellency will be good enough to
                                transmit to His Excellency Mr. Roosevelt the expression of the

                            that he had learned from various sources, including the newspapers and
                            the Chase National Bank, of the payment of Panama Canal annuities. He
                            requested to be informed whether the distribution of payments in the
                            form of three checks, two to the Chase National Bank of $1,500,000 and
                            $220,000, respectively, and one to the Government of Panama for
                            $860,000, was correct. Inasmuch as Mr. White seemed to be in possession
                            of accurate information, I informed him that his information was
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. White then stated that he felt that the irrevocable instructions
                            given by the Panamanian Government to the United States Government were
                            clear to the effect that all of the annuity payments were to be turned
                            over to the Chase National Bank as Fiscal Agent. I informed <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0761"/>Mr. White that that was a legal
                            question which I was not prepared to discuss. He said that in the
                            interest of protection of the bondholders he felt that the Council would
                            have to write the Department a letter setting forth the Council’s
                            contention that the money should have been paid over to the Chase
                            National Bank as Fiscal Agent.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I enclose herewith, for the
                            information of the Department, a copy of the cable<note n="10" xml:id="d695fn10">Not printed.</note> which the Council has to-day
                            sent to the President of Panama requesting the return of the $860,000 of
                            the canal annuity paid directly to Panama last week. The Council feels
                            that these funds are unquestionably pledged to the service of the Panama
                            dollar bonds and that this sum should be paid by the Panamanian
                            Government to the proper paying agents for the service of the dollar
                            bonds of Panama.</p>
                        <p>As I have said orally to members of the Department in the past, the
                            Council feels that the full Canal annuity of 430,000 Balboas a year is
                            pledged for the service of the bonds and should, under the terms of the
                            bond contracts and related documents, be paid directly to the Fiscal
                            Agents serving these bonds, and I have the honor to request that the
                            Council be given a hearing, on behalf of the American holders of these
                            bonds, regarding this matter before any further Canal annuity
                            installments are paid.</p>
                        <p>I trust you will agree with me that the bondholders have a very real
                            interest in knowing the terms and conditions which the Government of
                            Panama requested should be attached to the two payments of $1,500,000
                            and $220,000 to the Chase National Bank and that you will therefore be
                            willing to advise the Council, as set up to represent the bondholders’
                            interests, what were, if any, such terms and conditions.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, the officers of the Council are at the disposal of
                            yourself and other members of the Department to discuss the matter of
                            the Canal annuity payments at such time as may be most convenient to you
                            or to the other officers of the Department.</p>

                            your letter dated September 26, 1939 enclosing a copy of a cablegram
                            which the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Incorporated, has
                            addressed to the President of Panama, requesting “the return of the
                            $860,000 of the Canal annuity” recently paid by this Government to the
                            Republic of Panama. It is noted that the Council feels that these funds
                            are unquestionably pledged to the service of the Panama dollar bonds,
                            and that this sum should be paid by the Panamanian Government to the
                            proper paying agents for the service of the dollar bonds of Panama.</p>
                        <p>You request that the Council be given a hearing, on behalf of the
                            American holders of these bonds, before any further Canal annuity
                            payments are made. In reply, you are advised that the Department will be
                            pleased to receive the officers of the Council at their convenience and
                            to hear their views with respect to the proper disposition of the Canal
                            annuity payments. It may be stated in advance, however, that the
                            Department considers that the instructions regarding these payments
                            which have been received from the Panamanian Government are in
                            conformity with instructions which had previously been received, and
                            that this Government’s obligations will have been discharged upon their
                            execution.</p>
                        <p>The payments have been subject to no conditions or terms other than that
                            they represent full payment of the sum due from this Government on
                            account of the Canal annuities for the period 1934–1939 inclusive.</p>

                                    instrument creating the Canal Zone and governing all matters
                                    connected therewith which are not specifically amended by the
                                    Treaty of 1936, then is the annuity provided for in the later
                                    treaty to be considered as the equivalent of the annuity of the
                                    Treaty of 1903, or, if the new annuity be not the equivalent of
                                    the old, then what part of the new annuity is equivalent to the
                                    old annuity and is the excess to be regarded as an additional

                                <item>Would the Department be good enough to furnish us with a copy
                                    of any directions or instructions or requests which it received
                                    from the Panamanian Government touching the matter of the
                                    accrued annuity payments and also a copy of the instructions
                                    which were sent by the Department to the Chase Bank in

                                    These would be most helpful to us in understanding the questions

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. White</hi>: I have received your letter
                            of October 19, 1939 wherein, on behalf of the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, and as bearing upon its relation to the rights of
                            the holders of bonds of the Republic of Panama, you submit several
                            questions to the Department.</p>
                        <p>By way of reply I refer in the first instance to the following provisions
                            of Articles VII and XI of the General Treaty of March 2, 1936 between
                            the United States and Panama: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Beginning with the annuity payable in 1934 the payments under
                                    Article XIV of the Convention of November 18, 1903, between the
                                    United States of America and the Republic of Panama, shall be
                                    four hundred and thirty thousand Balboas (B/430,000.00) as
                                    defined by the agreement embodied in the exchange of notes of
                                    this date. The United States of America may discharge its
                                    obligation with respect to any such payment, upon payment in any
                                    coin or currency, provided the amount so paid is the equivalent
                                    of four hundred and thirty thousand Balboas (B/430,000.00) as so

                            embodied in an exchange of notes, I invite your attention to the notes
                            attached to the Treaty as exchanged March 2, 1936 in regard to the
                            Monetary Agreement of June 20, 1904<note n="14" xml:id="d698fn14">Effected by an exchange of notes, not printed.</note> between the
                            United States and Panama wherein reference is made to “the necessary <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0765"/>condition of the Agreement that
                            the standard unit of value of the Republic of Panama, the Balboa, should
                            continue at a parity at the rate of one dollar for one Balboa”. A
                            further statement is contained in these notes that “it has also been
                            recognized that in the Republic of Panama and in the Canal Zone silver
                            Balboas and fractional currency of the Republic are circulating together
                            with United States currency at the rate of one Balboa for one
                            dollar”.</p>
                        <p>Further replying to your inquiries I advise you that the annuity provided
                            for in the Treaty of 1936 is not considered as the equivalent of the
                            annuity for which provision is made in Article XIV of the Convention of
                            1903, but it is considered that $250,000 of the new annuity is
                            equivalent to the former annuity and that the excess over that amount is
                            intended as an additional grant to Panama made in consideration for
                            grants made to the United States in the Treaty of 1936.</p>
                        <p>I also wish to refer to your request for copies of communications from
                            the Government of Panama, and between this Department and the Chase
                            National Bank, regarding the accrued annuity payments. Inquiries have
                            been made in order to ascertain if the Panamanian Government has
                            objection to the disclosure of these official documents. If there are no
                            objections, I shall take pleasure in sending to you in the very near
                            future, copies of the relevant notes and letters.<note n="15" xml:id="d698fn15">These were sent on November 2, according to a

                        <p>The Paraguayan Minister called by appointment at 3 p.m. on April 19,
                            1939. After Mr. Briggs had explained that the Department desires to
                            assist the Paraguayan Government in whatever way may be proper, he
                            explained that it had been thought desirable to have a full and frank
                            conference with the Minister in order to determine the most effective
                            manner of helping Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>General Estigarribia, after describing the economic plight of his country
                            following the Chaco War, said that he personally is convinced that the
                            development of roads through the agricultural portion of the country
                            east of Asunción is the most important step at the present time. He said
                            that it was planned to construct a road from Asunción to the Brazilian
                            frontier at Iguassu but that only the first section of this road, from
                            Asunción to Villarrica, would be undertaken at this time in order not to
                            assume greater obligations than Paraguay could pay. General Estigarribia
                            explained that this road would follow the course of the railway for but
                            a relatively short distance, approximately to Loque and would then swing
                            north to Tobati and would proceed north of Valenzuela, through Ajos, and
                            then south to Villarrica. He explained that this, section would cost
                            approximately $3,500,000; would take three years to build; and that not
                            only would it be a splendid step for Paraguay but that at the same time
                            it would give employment to demobilized officers and soldiers.</p>
                        <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0767"/>
                        <p>The General then said that the contract with Colonel Taylor had not been
                            signed as certain minor revisions were necessary to make it acceptable
                            to the Paraguayan Congress. He said that the Taylor group, which he
                            explained had been formed only for this purpose, proposes to sign a
                            contract for the construction of this road and that Paraguay should pay
                            it with funds advanced by the Export-Import Bank.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Briggs thereupon gave a short explanation of the functioning of the
                            Export-Import Bank in cases of this nature and referred briefly to the
                            plan which had been worked out with the Haitian Government. He said that
                            the Department would consult the Government departments involved and
                            draw up an explanatory memorandum for the Minister, to be ready in
                            approximately a week.</p>
                        <p>General Estigarribia then said that a second matter of great importance
                            was to obtain a fund which might be used as a gold backing for the
                            Paraguayan peso. He explained that the Government “expropriates” fifty
                            percent of all exchange produced by exports, paying the exporters in
                            Paraguayan currency. He said that this foreign exchange is supposed to
                            be used to back the peso but that due to war necessities, it had all
                            been spent and there is now very little gold backing. He said that if a
                            credit could be obtained in the United States which would give
                            confidence in the value of the peso, the exchange collected each year,
                            which he estimated at a minimum of $2,000,000, could be used for public
                            works in Paraguay and for the purchase of the necessary agricultural
                            machinery, etc., to develop the country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Feis said that the Department would give this phase of the matter
                            every consideration but pointed out that the creation of a credit of
                            this nature required Congressional action as in the Brazilian case, but
                            that the Department would discuss it with the Treasury and include in
                            its memorandum such recommendations as might be possible.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to inform Your
                            Excellency that on June 17 next I will leave by aeroplane to return to
                            my country, where I must arrive before the end of the month because of
                            matters related to the coming constitutional change of Government which
                            will take place August 15 next.<note n="5" xml:id="d700fn5">Mr.

                            truly regret that my stay in the United States <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0768"/>must be relatively very short. The
                            extraordinary progress of this country in all matters is a perpetual
                            source of education for all the other new countries of our continent and
                            we all have a great deal to learn here. But above all, the cordial
                            hospitality and the friendly understanding which His Excellency the
                            President of the United States as well as Your Excellency have
                            consistently shown me have been for me a cause of satisfaction which I
                            can never forget. They reveal to me how sincere and effective is the
                            determination of His Excellency President Roosevelt, in close
                            collaboration with Your Excellency, to convert into reality the policy
                            of true cooperation and good will between the American Republics which
                            the Government of the United States so wisely pursues. I carry to my
                            country the most ardent admiration for the notable talents as a
                            statesman of His Excellency the President and for the high qualities of
                            Your Excellency.</p>

                            the constructive task of developing its natural resources. Paraguay
                            knows from bitter experience what sacrifices and what diversion of
                            energies from economic and social progress are imposed by war. It turns
                            from the sword to the ploughshare with deep satisfaction, and as a
                            result of the freely-expressed choice of the Paraguayan people. I
                            realize, as do my fellow citizens, the magnitude of the task which faces
                            us, but we are determined to succeed and to obtain those benefits of
                            modern civilization which will mean happiness and prosperity to the
                            country. The United States already has shown its desire to be of
                            assistance through cooperation in the lending of experts on various
                            subjects, and any further help which it now may be able to offer in the
                            matters set forth below will strengthen and perpetuate those friendly
                            ties which mark the cordial relations so happily existing between the
                            two countries.</p>

                        <p>In carrying out its desire of encouraging the expansion of production of

                            production in and furnish the United States with necessary and assured
                            sources of supply, the Government of Paraguay greatly appreciates the
                            cooperation which is being extended by the Government of the United
                            States in the study and development of such products. My Government
                            considers that the development of the nation’s economy and natural
                            resources and of economic relations between Paraguay and the United
                            States may further be stimulated by the provision of adequate

                            routes of communication to foreign nations. In order to make possible

                            Paraguay and the development of other projects designed to increase the

                            States, the Government of Paraguay requests the extension of credit
                            facilities for the financing in the United States of equipment,
                            materials and essential services.</p>

                            the United States would be further encouraged by the carrying out by the
                            Government of Paraguay of a policy of meeting promptly commercial
                            obligations to United States nationals and concerns and reducing
                            seasonal and unusual fluctuations in the rate of exchange of the peso.
                            To carry out this policy, credit in United States currency to the Banco
                            de la Republica del Paraguay would be desirable.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>

                            resources I wish to assure Your Excellency that it is the intention of
                            the Government of Paraguay to accord every appropriate protection and
                            security to encourage such investment by United States citizens.</p>
                        <p>Before closing, I wish to express to Your Excellency the conviction of
                            the Paraguayan people, and my own, that with the realization of the
                            program outlined above, there will be assured the prompt economic and
                            financial rehabilitation of Paraguay whose progress, through the

                            solving these problems. The United States is very pleased to have had a

                        <p>It is my opinion that it would be highly desirable for the Banco de la

                            Paraguay of stimulating the expansion of Paraguayan foreign commerce and
                            economic relations with the United States by meeting promptly commercial

                            with Paraguay, the Paraguayan Legation in Washington has signed a
                            contract for the services of Eric F. Lamb as adviser to the Banco de la
                            República during the period credits are extended by the Export-Import
                            Bank to the bank. Mr. Lamb has been employed until recently by the
                            Federal Reserve Bank of New York and will sail from New York for Buenos
                            Aires on July 21 on the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Southern Prince</hi>

                            <p>Paraguay is one of the countries which has received the financial
                                collaboration of the United States Government, through the granting
                                of special credits intended for the execution of public works and to
                                meet the needs of the trade between the two countries.</p>

                                $500,000, intended for the purpose of stimulating the expansion of
                                Paraguayan foreign commerce and economic relations with the United
                                States, and to meet the commercial obligations with the said country
                                and, likewise, to regulate the fluctuations of the rate of

                            <p>The granting of this loan to the Bank of the Republic of Paraguay was
                                concluded before European events had reached a crisis, and it can be
                                affirmed, that in determining the amount thereof the dislocations
                                created by the European war in the régime of international commerce
                                could not be taken into account.</p>
                            <p>The European war has caused great disturbances in commercial
                                relations. International trade has been restricted and some
                                traditional markets of Paraguay have been closed, not only to
                                importation but to exportation.</p>
                            <p>This diversion of the trade of Paraguay will be intensified until the
                                United States will become the most important commercial center of
                                acquisition, a circumstance which must be taken into account in
                                connection with the Bank of the Republic, an official institution
                                charged with facilitating dollar exchange to pay for imports.</p>

                            <p>A noticeable increase is observed in the volume of imports from the
                                United States since just before the war.</p>
                            <p>This month the amount of the permits will be much larger and the
                                proportion will increase if the European war lasts a long time.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing circumstances, and as a measure of
                                foresight, it would be necessary for the credit of $500,000 extended
                                to the Bank of the Republic, and which will be used to meet the
                                payments for the purchases made in the United States and guarantee
                                the stability of the currency indispensable for the security of
                                engagements contracted in the United States, to be increased in the
                                amount of $500,000 more, under the same conditions as the previous
                                one.</p>
                            <p>The Bank of the Republic has scarcely begun to make use of the said
                                credit and will soon have to do so on a larger scale in order to
                                facilitate to Paraguayan commerce its purchases in the United
                                States. In former years, without the canalization of the commerce of
                                Paraguay toward the United States having occurred, it reached an
                                average amount of $650,000.</p>

                        </table>
                        <p>Dr. Fernandez, the new Paraguayan Minister, called on Mr. Pierson of the
                            Export-Import Bank on December 6, 1939. I accompanied him to interpret
                            if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that he had communicated to this Department the
                            desire of his Government to have an additional credit of $500,000,
                            necessitated by the large increase in imports from the United States, a
                            diversion of trade which he thought would be permanent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that he viewed the Paraguayan request with the greatest
                            sympathy and fully understood the economic difficulties facing that
                            country. He said, however, that the first difficulty was a lack of
                            funds, at least at this time, adding that it would be possible to
                            reconsider the matter when and if the funds of the Bank were increased.
                            He said that before proceeding with further credit arrangements it would
                            be well to see how the present arrangement is working, pointing out that
                            in addition to the $500,000 credit, the Banco de la República should
                            soon feel the effect of the additional foreign exchange which will be
                            brought into the country through dollar expenditures on the road
                            building project. The Minister interposed that these two matters were
                            entirely separate, the $500,000 credit having been made to the Bank
                            while the road funds were an obligation of the Government. He said that
                            he feared, as did General Estigarribia, that with the rapid increase in
                            imports from the United States this credit would be exhausted and
                            merchants clamoring for exchange in the free market would have an
                            unfortunate effect on the exchange rate. Mr. Pierson then said that with
                            the additional funds coming in from the road construction program he
                            thought this danger limited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson continued that while the moment was not ripe for an
                            additional credit, he would continue his careful consideration of the
                            matter but before proceeding further wanted more detailed information
                            from Mr. Lamb and from the Banco de la República regarding its actual
                            position, explaining that as it is now prepared, its balance sheet
                            leaves much to be desired. He said that Lamb was working <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0776"/>with the Banco and that undoubtedly the
                            information would be available. He also spoke of additional data on
                            imports and exports and the foreign exchange reserves of the Banco,
                            explaining that he would have to have this detailed information in order
                            to base his actions on a sound banking basis. He handed the Minister a
                            short informal memorandum outlining the foregoing points and reiterated
                            that he would gladly reconsider the matter at a later date, suggesting
                            that at the end of three months the situation would be much clearer and
                            that perhaps at that time, when the full effect of the credit operation
                            and road program could be seen, Paraguay might find that it did not need
                            an additional credit.</p>
                        <p>While the Minister apparently understood Mr. Pierson’s remarks, he was
                            obviously disappointed but went away somewhat cheered by the prospect of
                            renewing his request later.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez and Señor Beltrán called by appointment to continue the
                            preliminary discussions initiated on November 9 at an introductory
                            meeting with Assistant Secretary Grady for the purpose of exploring the
                            possibilities of establishing a basis upon which negotiations for a
                            trade agreement between the United States and Peru might be
                            undertaken.</p>
                        <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0778"/>
                        <p>The history of preliminary conversations which took place in Lima in 1938
                            looking to the establishment of a mutually satisfactory basis for
                            trade-agreement negotiations was reviewed by Mr. Hawkins who pointed out
                            that those conversations had not resulted in the establishment of such a
                            basis, principally on account of the apparent reluctance of the
                            Government of Peru to extend to the commerce of the United States tariff
                            concessions granted by Peru to Chile in the trade agreement between
                            those two countries.</p>
                        <p>Señores Chavez and Beltrán were furnished with copies of the draft
                            general provisions developed by this Government for use in trade
                            agreements and each one of the articles in that draft was reviewed and
                            explained to the Peruvian representatives, who indicated that they did
                            not believe that their Government would have any great difficulty in
                            accepting them in substance, with the exception of the article dealing
                            with most-favored-nation treatment. A considerable discussion followed
                            on the latter point and the previously expressed attitude of this
                            Government was conveyed to Señores Chavez and Beltrán that in a trade
                            agreement with Peru we might be willing to permit certain exceptions to
                            unconditional-most-favored-nation treatment in connection with Peruvian
                            concessions granted to Chile, provided those exceptions did not affect
                            any articles of substantial commercial interest to the United States.
                            There then followed a discussion of the various products on which Peru
                            grants exclusive concessions to Chile. It was pointed out to the
                            Peruvian representatives that of those products the United States would
                            expect in any trade agreement with Peru to receive
                            unconditional-most-favored-nation treatment with respect to the
                            following articles and possibly some others: lumber, fresh fruits, dried
                            fruits, oats, wheat, canned fruits, canned vegetables, canned milk and
                            sewing machines. It was indicated that the products mentioned above,
                            listed in their approximate order of importance to the United States,
                            were entirely distinct from any other products on which the United
                            States might desire to receive concessions in a trade agreement with
                            Peru, and the foregoing minimum list referred only to those items on
                            which exclusive tariff concessions were granted by Peru to Chile.</p>
                        <p>A general discussion followed as to the establishment of a basis for
                            trade-agreement negotiations and the time at which such negotiations
                            might take place. The Peruvian representatives stated that their
                            instructions from their Government expressly stipulated that none of the
                            concessions extended by Peru exclusively to Chile could be extended to
                            the United States, and they did not feel that they could ask their
                            Government to recede from its position on this question unless they
                            could present some indication of the concessions which might be secured
                            from the United States in a trade agreement. It <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0779"/>was emphasized to Señores Chavez and
                            Beltrán that no commitments could be given with respect to any products
                            on which this Government might consider granting concessions in a trade
                            agreement prior to the giving of the usual public notice of intention to
                            negotiate, the receipt of views submitted by interested persons in this
                            country in writing and orally, and full consideration of such views by
                            the trade-agreements organization. It was pointed out by Mr. Hawkins
                            that in as much as the trade-agreements organization was now extremely
                            occupied with pending negotiations with several countries, it was not
                            believed that it would be possible to undertake at this time any
                            detailed consideration of a trade agreement with Peru, but it would be
                            helpful for future use if the Peruvian Government were to study the
                            position of this Government with respect to the exclusive preferences
                            granted by Peru to Chile.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that a further conversation would be held on the following
                            day.</p>

                        <p>Señor Chavez and Señor Beltrán called by appointment to continue the
                            conversation held on the previous day with respect to the possibility of
                            establishing a basis for trade-agreement negotiations between the United
                            States and Peru.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hawkins indicated again that trade agreements now under negotiation
                            with several countries would completely occupy the time of the
                            trade-agreements organization, probably until at least the end of the
                            present year. Shortly thereafter the Trade Agreements Act,<note n="3" xml:id="d709fn3">Approved June 12, 1934, 48 Stat. 943; extended by
                                Joint Resolution of March 1, 1937, 50 Stat. 24.</note> which expires
                            June 12, 1940, may come up in Congress for renewal and probably will not
                            be disposed of before March. This would impose an additional burden on
                            the trade-agreements organization, involving the preparation of
                            memoranda for Congressional committees <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0780"/>and the answering of the large volume of correspondence
                            to which the consideration of a question of this kind in Congress gives
                            rise. Mr. Hawkins indicated that under such circumstances it would not
                            be possible to undertake trade-agreement negotiations with Peru in the
                            immediate future.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed, however, that further preliminary conversations might be
                            held looking to the establishment of a basis for negotiations so as to
                            be ready if it should become feasible and desirable at some future time
                            to proceed with such negotiations, and it was decided that another
                            meeting would be held on November 30.</p>

                            establishing a basis for trade-agreement negotiations between the United
                            States and Peru. Señor Beltrán furnished a list of the products<note n="4" xml:id="d710fn4">Not found in Department files.</note> on
                            which Peru might be interested in securing concessions in a trade
                            agreement and a general discussion took place out of which the following
                            points emerged: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Mr. Hawkins indicated that the trade-agreements organization
                                    was not in a position at this time to give definitive
                                    consideration to the possibility of a trade agreement with Peru,
                                    and particularly with respect to sugar, that it would not be
                                    possible to consider this item until the domestic situation with
                                    respect to quotas, et cetera, had been clarified. It was pointed
                                    out, however, that studies would be undertaken as rapidly as
                                    possible on the various items on which the Peruvian Government
                                    had expressed interest.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Señor Beltrán made it clear that particularly with respect to
                                    sugar, the situation in Peru was critical and would remain so
                                    during the next four to five months until the current crop had
                                    been sold. He stated that it was highly important that Peru
                                    secure a greater outlet for its sugar in the United States
                                    market.</item>

                                <item>Señor Beltrán also indicated that if the economic situation in
                                    Peru, particularly regarding sugar, could not be improved
                                    through a trade agreement with the United States, Peru would
                                    undoubtedly have to seek a barter or some similar arrangement
                                    with the United Kingdom or France.</item>

                        <p>It was agreed that the conversations would be renewed in January when

                        <p>42. President Benavides took occasion of the luncheon given today in his
                            honor aboard U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi> to ask if I
                            knew why the American Government is apparently discriminating against
                            Peru in the matter of loans. He mentioned recent negotiations with
                                Brazil<note n="5" xml:id="d711fn5">See <ref target="#pg_348">pp.

                            invitation to the United States to the Chilean Minister of Finance.<note n="7" xml:id="d711fn7">See <ref target="#pg_439">pp. 439</ref>
                                ff.</note> At first the President appeared perturbed and spoke in a
                            somewhat threatening manner saying if Peru were unimportant to the
                            United States, it could turn to Germany and buy more things from her as
                            Germany was anxious to get more Peruvian cotton. The President, quite
                            irrelevantly, said Peru had tried to do the right thing by the United
                            States in building its section of Pan-American Highway.</p>
                        <p>I said I was not well informed in this matter but if there was any reason
                            for what appeared to him as a lack of consideration on the part of the
                            United States perhaps it might be because Peru has made no effort to
                            repay the loans of the American bondholders<note n="8" xml:id="d711fn8">See <ref target="frus1938v05#pg_874">

                            my statements as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I informed the Ambassador that it is the policy of this Government to
                            cooperate with the other American republics to the fullest practicable
                            extent and that we are desirous of establishing satisfactory bases upon
                            which an arrangement with Peru might be negotiated. To date no
                            discussions have been possible since an approach has not been made by
                            that Government.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that President Benavides has been misinformed with respect
                            to the negotiations which have taken place with Brazil and those now
                            contemplated with Chile. In both cases the initiative came from the
                            interested countries and the invitations were issued after determining
                            that bases existed for positive economic cooperation between those
                            countries and the United States. The fact that Brazil gave assurances
                            that it would at an early date resume payments on account of interest
                            and amortization on dollar bonds, thereby affording evidence of good
                            faith in meeting financial obligations, materially facilitated the
                            conclusion of a mutually advantageous arrangement for economic
                            cooperation and financial assistance. In the case of Chile, assurances
                            have been received that it is not the intention of that Government to
                            modify the existing debt settlement plan. The reference to Colombia is
                            not clear since there have been no negotiations of the character in mind
                            between that Government and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I also pointed out that this Government is desirous of improving the
                            commercial relations between the two countries by the conclusion of a
                            trade agreement if mutually satisfactory bases for negotiations can be
                            found. With that end in view exploratory conversations were initiated
                            last year. However, the whole question is in abeyance awaiting the list
                            of products requested last November which Peru would like to except in
                            such agreement in favor of Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was reassured that this Government entertains a keen
                            desire to cooperate in every practical manner with Peru. Furthermore the
                            belief was expressed that with these explanations President <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0783"/>Benavides would recognize that the
                            United States has not been discriminating against Peru.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the President should make reference to the financing of
                            the sale of hospital equipment to the National Social Insurance
                            Institute requested in the early part of this year, you may say that the
                            decision of the Export-Import Bank not to participate was predicated on
                            the understanding that the Government of Peru was unwilling to work out
                            an arrangement for the resumption of service on its present bonded
                            obligations held in the United States. You may add that this action was
                            not intended as an effort to exert pressure on the Peruvian Government
                            with regard to any specific proposals or terms of settlement of that
                            debt; but rather it was the logical inability of the Bank to undertake
                            new financing pending a clarification of the attitude of the Government
                            of Peru with respect to previous obligations now in complete default.

                        <p>43. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 37, June 3, 1 p.m., last
                            evening I was able to confirm to President Benavides the substance of
                            the Under Secretary’s conversation on May 31 with the Peruvian
                            Ambassador, which had been already telegraphed to him by the latter.</p>
                        <p>The President said that in addition Ambassador Freyre had reported that
                            the Department would be glad to receive duly qualified representatives
                            to discuss the possibility of economic cooperation between Peru and the
                            United States and that he would therefore send a commission to the
                            United States for this purpose without delay. However, with
                            characteristic petulance the President found fault that the invitation
                            extended to Peru was different from the one to Brazil and Chile as Peru
                            was told that “it could send qualified experts” while from the other two
                            countries “specific officials had been invited.” He went on to say that
                            in the case of Brazil he could understand this special courtesy because
                            of our close relations but as for Chile he did not see any explanation
                            for it remarking irrelevantly that the Chileans had been buying up their
                            depreciated bonds in the open market, a practice which he understood was
                            disapproved in the United States. I assured the President that in my
                            opinion there was not the least intention at the Department to
                            discriminate against Peru in any way. My explanation seemed to satisfy
                            him drily in part.</p>

                        <p>Before I left the President said that he desired to express his
                            appreciation to the Department for its very prompt action in this
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>39. Your telegram no. 43, June 8, 11 a.m. There is no basis for any
                            feeling on the part of President Benavides that this Government lacks
                            desire to develop fuller and closer economic relations between the
                            United States and Peru or is in any way discriminating in another’s
                            favor as compared with Peru. It is hoped that you can convince President
                            Benavides that this is so.</p>
                        <p>Please inform President Benavides that this Government will be happy to
                            welcome a mission here in Washington to discuss the means and terms for
                            possible extension of economic cooperation between the two countries.
                            When you convey this invitation please explain that the reason it is not
                            extended to any designated official of the Peruvian Government, which
                            was the form followed in the case of the invitation to Brazil and Chile,
                            arises from the fact that the invitation is being extended at an earlier
                            and more preliminary stage of the discussions than was the case with
                            Brazil and Chile. In these instances essential preliminary conversations
                            had been conducted for a considerable time with officials of these
                            Governments, in the one case the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil,
                            and in the other the Minister of Finance of Chile, before invitations
                            were arranged. It was then natural the invitations should be addressed
                            to the particular officials with whom the work had already been carried
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>In order that the discussions in Washington with the inevitable attendant
                            publicity will have a successful issue it is essential, in the interests
                            of both Governments, that there be a most careful and thorough
                            preliminary exploration of the possibilities before a mission is sent.
                            Please say to the President that your Government is confident that he
                            will agree upon the usefulness and importance of such prior exchange of
                            views.</p>
                        <p>The Department will for its part carry forward its studies. As a
                            counterpart it is suggested that the Peruvian Government undertake and
                            present in memoranda form proposals, as specific in detail as may be
                            possible, of what it believes desirable and feasible. This will enable
                            us to determine what may be possible. This will prepare the way for a
                            successful mission to the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0785"/>
                        <p>It may be useful to have you make clear to the President the type of
                            cooperation that might be considered as illustrated by the arrangements
                            concluded with Brazil. Of course the form and scope of any arrangement
                            with Peru must be determined primarily by the particular set of facts
                            that present themselves. You may furnish the President with a copy of
                            press release no. 84 of March 9<note n="13" xml:id="d714fn13">Department
                                of State, <hi rend="italic">Press Releases</hi>, March 11, 1939, p.
                                174.</note> outlining briefly the arrangements undertaken and the
                            assistance contemplated.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the reference made by President Benavides to the Chilean
                            debt, you may point out that neither this Government nor the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council condones the practice of a debtor’s
                            purchasing in the open market bonds which have been depreciated by the
                            debtor’s failure to pay the interest on them. A settlement reached by
                            negotiation between the interested parties which provides for reasonable
                            amortization operating concurrently with interest payments at some
                            agreed rate, is not open to this objection. The Government of the United
                            States does not conduct direct negotiations to determine the terms of
                            debt adjustments, but it does endeavor in all appropriate ways to obtain
                            consideration of the interests of American bondholders and to facilitate
                            the negotiations of their representatives. The question of the Chilean
                            debt settlement was fully discussed by the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council with the Chilean Government and the Council on
                            October 24, 1938, after analyzing the proposed settlement in detail,
                            left “to each bondholder himself to determine whether or not he wishes
                            to accept the amount of services offered.” You may add that it has been
                            indicated to the Chilean Government that an essential condition of any
                            arrangement for economic cooperation would be an assurance from the
                            Chilean Government that at least the present interest payments on the
                            external debt be continued.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Peru the Department has found it difficult to understand
                            the attitude exhibited by the Peruvian Government in having assented to
                            a settlement reached with the holders of the Guano Bonds whereas the
                            negotiations on behalf of the American bondholders have not prospered
                            and actually have been suspended regardless of the fact that the
                            negotiator indicated a willingness to accept a settlement on a basis
                            less favorable to the bondholders, in proportion to their contractual
                            rights, than the one concluded with the British group. You may find it
                            expedient to repeat the statement made by the Under Secretary to the
                            Peruvian Ambassador that “in view of our knowledge of the very favorable
                            economic and financial situation of the Peruvian Government, in which we
                            all rejoice, it was very difficult to understand why no real effort had
                            been made by the Government <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0786"/>to
                            reach an agreement for the adjustment of the legitimate obligations to
                            the bondholders.” You may also point out that Chile is now making
                            substantial payments on account of service whereas the Peruvian dollar
                            bonds are in complete default and negotiations seeking a resumption of
                            payments have been suspended.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear from your telegram that the subject matter of the last
                            paragraph of the Department’s telegram no. 37, June 3, 1 p.m. was
                            discussed in your conversation with the President. If you have not
                            already done so, you may, in your discretion, refer to that matter and
                            convey the statements already authorized.</p>

                        <p>50. With reference to the Department’s telegram No. 40 of June 23, 7 p.m.
                            the Foreign Office has not yet been able to arrange my audience with
                            Benavides. The Foreign Minister<note n="14" xml:id="d716fn14">Enrique

                            13, 1 p.m. was explained in detail to the Minister of Foreign Relations
                            on June 15. The Foreign Minister informs me that he immediately conveyed
                            this information to the President and that the latter already clearly
                            understands that there must be extensive prefatory conversations before

                        <p>The justified fear of Peruvian agriculturalists that they will not be
                            able to find in the near future buyers for cotton and sugar production
                            because they consider the German market lost, which was absorbing from
                            20% to 25% of our exports (presumably of cotton and sugar exports only)
                            and because they consider the British market doubtful, which was
                            consuming up until now 35% of our exports, has aroused a lack of
                            confidence and uncertainty in the holders of foreign exchange which has
                            placed the stability of our currency in serious danger in the last days
                            of this week.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Peru considers in the circumstances that the economic
                            assistance which the United States has indicated it is disposed to grant
                            us may be placed in effect immediately to avoid the greater depreciation
                            of the sol which our Reserve Bank already has great difficulty in
                            preventing.</p>
                        <p>This considerable lack of exchange has already had as its first result
                            the reduction and almost the paralyzation of importation of merchandise
                            from the United States.</p>
                        <p>An urgent and indispensable measure to remedy this situation would be the
                            opening of a credit in dollars in the Export-Import Bank of Washington
                            for the Reserve Bank of Peru which institution would distribute the
                            credit among the Peruvian importers of North American merchandise. These
                            importers would deposit in the Reserve Bank <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0788"/>the equivalent amounts in soles, the liquidation
                            between dollars and soles to be effected at a rate of exchange to be
                            determined.</p>
                        <p>The amounts thus deposited in the Reserve Bank to the credit of the
                            Export-Import Bank would be balanced periodically in the future on bases
                            that would be studied, one of which could be the value of United States
                            imports of Peruvian products.</p>

                        <p>The Government of Peru takes the liberty to continue in its applications
                            for a credit in dollars concerning which it has been negotiating to
                            continue import trade with the United States which is completely
                            paralyzed at this time.</p>
                        <p>Without prejudicing the possibility of arriving at a subsequent agreement
                            and to alleviate the precarious situation the Export-Import Bank could
                            grant immediately a credit of $6,000,000 to the Banco Central de Reserva
                            del Peru to reestablish its commercial transactions.</p>
                        <p>The credit would be used by the Banco Central de Reserva del Peru for
                            imports from the United States, selling the exchange bills at the rate
                            of the day and crediting this amount to the order of the Export-Import
                            Bank, the total in dollar bills being represented by the equivalent
                            amount in Peruvian currency.</p>
                        <p>The Banco Central de Reserva, in order to amortize the credit, would take
                            the amount in dollars of the value of Peruvian products sold in the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian Government would guarantee through the Banco Central de
                            Reserva whatever difference might occur in the rate of exchange at the
                            time of liquidating the credit.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Peru, which has learned that there have been recently
                            granted similar credits to Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia, hopes that its
                            request may be complied with, taking into consideration the current
                            emergency situation.</p>

                        <p>79. The Secretary General and the Chief of the Political Section of the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both of whom are competent and well
                            informed officials, made statements to me which are of interest in
                            connection with economic and financial cooperation with Peru that may be
                            undertaken as a result of the Panama Conference.<note n="16" xml:id="d720fn16">For correspondence concerning the Panama
                                Conference, see <ref target="#pg_15">pp. 15</ref> ff.</note> They
                            said that the Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs was very pleased by
                            the sympathetic and helpful attitude shown by Mr. Welles. In commenting
                            upon possible assistance from the United States, they observed that
                            Peruvian Government revenues have declined, that very little dollar
                            exchange is available, and that Peru needs financial help to meet the
                            war situation. They apparently expect that a representative of the
                            Export-Import Bank will visit Peru soon to discuss these matters. They
                            indicated that in their opinion studies relating to a possible trade
                            agreement might be expedited by the Peruvian Government, if a large
                            enough loan could be obtained in the United States, service on the
                            defaulted bonds might be resumed. Aside from repeating that my
                            Government naturally would welcome any progress toward a solution of
                            pending problems I made no specific comment.</p>
                        <p>The exchange situation continues unsatisfactory. The rate for the dollar
                            is officially held at 5 soles 36 cents although official quotations of
                            sterling and other free exchanges are the equivalent of about 5.60 soles
                            per dollar. The National City Bank is receiving about 25% of
                            requirements for urgent coverage and about 10% of all requirements. The
                            manager expresses the opinion confidentially that United States trade
                            has not been seriously affected as yet but that it is doubtful if dollar

                            <item>—Trade between Perú and the United States has practically ceased,
                                due to the impossibility of obtaining dollars on the Lima market.
                                Moreover the demand made by American importers for the equivalent of
                                cash payment, increases the difficulty;</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>—In order to reestablish normal commercial intercourse with the
                                United States, Perú requires without delay five to six million
                                dollar credits;</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>—The Central Reserve Bank of Perú would handle these credits,
                                selling drafts for the imports from the United States to Peru.
                                Peruvian importers would purchase from the Central Reserve Bank of
                                Peru the drafts they need, paying for them in Peruvian currency at
                                the exchange of the day. Thus, the total amount drawn in dollars
                                would always be represented by Peruvian currency deposited in the
                                Central Reserve Bank of Perú. The Peruvian Government would
                                guarantee, through the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, any difference
                                in the type of exchange at the date of settlement;</item>

                                importers for Peruvian products;</item>

                                if means could be devised to intensify the sale of Peruvian products
                                in the United States. If for instance, the Export and Import Bank
                                could take charge of marketing the sale in the United States of
                                certain Peruvian products, such as cotton, paying 80% of their value
                                upon delivery, and the 20% balance after the sale is
                                effected.</item>

                                    for the United States have been restricted by the high rate of

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report upon statements
                            made by President Benavides regarding possible assistance for Peru from
                            the United States in the matter of the extension of credits by the
                            Export-Import Bank. The statements were made during the interview that
                            took place when I accompanied Mr. Edward F. Roosevelt in his visit to
                            the President to discuss Peruvian participation during the second year
                            of the New York World’s Fair.</p>
                        <p>The gist of the President’s vehement remarks, which he emphasized by
                            pounding upon the arm of his chair, was that the United States seems to
                            forget that there is a west coast of South America and is concerned only
                            about the east coast countries, that in spite of friendly words there
                            has been no action taken with respect to the extension of credits to
                            Peru by the Export-Import Bank, that no reply has been received to
                            Peruvian proposals (the President did not specify what proposals he
                            referred to), that formerly credits were extended for Peruvian purchases
                            of products imported from the United States but now cash is demanded,
                            and that the present conditions interfere with trade between the two
                            countries. He went on to comment upon the investment and trade
                            opportunities in Peru.</p>
                        <p>I reminded the President that the Department is under a great pressure of
                            work at the present time, including such studies as the general program
                            for inter-American economic and financial cooperation, the special
                            problems of individual countries, and the possible increase in the
                            capital of the Export-Import Bank, and I told him that I was sure there
                            was absolutely no discrimination in the case of Peru and that questions
                            of interest to Peru are receiving the most careful consideration. Mr.
                            Roosevelt, to whom the President was very cordial, said that next year
                            he hoped to be able to interest some of his associates in a study of
                            investment possibilities in Peru.</p>
                        <p>Part of President Benavides’ attitude may be due to what, I fear, is a
                            none too friendly feeling towards the United States. It was apparent on
                            this occasion, as in the past, that he also does not understand the
                            policies of the United States with respect to economic and financial
                            cooperation with the other American Republics nor the nature and bases
                            of agreements such as that between the United States and Brazil.
                            President-elect Prado certainly will have a much better understanding of
                            these economic and financial questions.</p>
                        <p>During the interview President Benavides also made the statement that he
                            will probably visit the United States early next year when he <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0793"/>would take in the New York
                            Fair. He added that he was desirous of getting away as soon as possible
                            as he felt he would not get much rest if he remained in Peru after the
                            inauguration. It will be recalled that the Peruvian Constitution
                            provides that an ex-President of the Republic take a seat in the Senate
                            for one term.</p>

                        <p>38. In pursuance of the trade-agreement discussions in Montevideo and in
                            accordance with the procedure generally followed in trade-agreement
                            conversations, this Government now desires to ascertain what concessions
                            the Uruguayan Government would expect in return for negotiating a trade
                            agreement on our basis. As a result of exhaustive study of all products
                            of which Uruguay is the chief or an important supplier to the United
                            States, this Government is fully prepared to give consideration to any
                            request, within the authority of the Trade Agreements Act,<note n="1" xml:id="d725fn1">Approved June 12, 1934, 48 Stat. 943; extended by
                                Joint Resolution of March 1, 1937, 50 Stat. 24.</note> which the
                            Uruguayan Government may wish to make in regard to the tariff treatment
                            of such products. A memorandum in this sense, which embodies this
                            Government’s proposed basis for a trade agreement (which is in line with
                            the Fowler-Sappington suggestions<note n="2" xml:id="d725fn2">See
                                footnote 3, <ref target="#pg_227">p. 227</ref>.</note>), is being
                            sent you by air mail for transmission to the Uruguayan Government. A
                            copy of the memorandum is also being handed to the Uruguayan Minister
                            here and a similar memorandum is being presented to the Argentine
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>You should, unless you perceive objection, immediately inform the
                            appropriate Uruguayan officials of the foregoing.<note n="3" xml:id="d725fn3">In telegram No. 47, June 30, noon, the Chargé

                  </p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the proposed basis for a trade agreement embodied
                            in the memorandum is in line with the suggestions, with respect to the
                            basis for a trade agreement, made to Uruguayan officials by officers of
                            the Department during conversations in Montevideo. The memorandum
                            contemplates the negotiation of a trade agreement under which, from its
                            effective date, the Uruguayan Government would accord full equality of
                            treatment to United States trade, as provided in the proposed general
                            provisions, and tariff treatment as indicated for United States
                            products. It is desired to ascertain what concessions the Uruguayan
                            Government would expect in return for according this treatment to United
                            States trade under an agreement.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the enclosed memorandum, the question of the negotiation
                            of a trade agreement with Uruguay is closely related to the question of
                            the negotiation of a trade agreement with Argentina.<note n="6" xml:id="d726fn6">See <ref target="#pg_227">pp. 227</ref> ff.</note>
                            Similar consideration and questions in regard to the basis for a trade

                            <p>The Government of the United States, in pursuance of the
                                conversations in Montevideo between officers of the Department of
                                State of the United States and officials of the Government of
                                Uruguay, desires to present to the Uruguayan Government certain
                                considerations and questions regarding the basis for a trade
                                agreement between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>Three essential elements comprise the basis for the negotiation of a
                                trade agreement: 1) possible tariff concessions by the United
                                States; 2) the general provisions of the agreement, particularly
                                those relating to quotas and exchange; and 3) possible tariff
                                concessions by Uruguay.</p>
                            <p>With reference to possible tariff concessions by the United States,
                                the maximum reduction in United States import charges permitted by
                                the Trade Agreements Act, under authority of which trade agreements
                                are negotiated, is 50 per cent. As the Government of Uruguay is
                                aware, the United States customarily grants tariff concessions only
                                in respect of articles of which the other country concerned is the
                                chief or an important source of imports into the United States. In
                                accordance with this principle, the Government of the United States
                                has exhaustively studied all products of which Uruguay is the chief
                                or an important supplier to the United States. The products studied
                                are contained in the attached list.<note n="7" xml:id="d726fn7">Printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                    October 21, 1939, p. 420.</note> As a result of this study, the
                                Government of the United States is now fully prepared to give
                                consideration to any requests which the Government of Uruguay may
                                desire to make in respect of the tariff treatment of the products
                                listed.</p>
                            <p>In making the above-mentioned study, the Government of the United
                                States has borne prominently in mind the importance attached by
                                Uruguay to the trade in meat, and has reexamined with the greatest
                                care the questions relating to the importation of chilled and frozen
                                meats from Uruguay. It has been forced to conclude that
                                circumstances connected with the sanitary laws and regulations of
                                this country are such that no practicable means can be found for
                                effecting any immediate improvement in this situation. However, the
                                Government of the United States, having in mind possible future
                                developments, would be willing to cooperate with interested
                                governments such as those of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil, should
                                such governments desire, in a study of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth
                                disease. A study of these diseases by an international group of
                                well-qualified scientists, preferably non-governmental, might
                                result, among other <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0797"/>things,
                                in a finding that meat prepared in certain ways could not possibly
                                transmit these diseases.</p>
                            <p>As regards the second element in the basis for negotiations, namely,
                                the general provisions, the Government of the United States could
                                not consider signing an agreement, involving substantial concessions
                                by the United States, which would leave products of the United
                                States exported to Uruguay at a disadvantage as compared with like
                                products imported from any other country.</p>
                            <p>The disadvantage to which United States trade in Uruguay is now
                                subjected is due to the practice of the Uruguayan Government of
                                controlling imports on a bilateral basis, by means of exchange
                                quotas and differential exchange rates, which favors imports from
                                certain countries to the detriment of other countries, particularly
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States fully appreciates that the
                                Uruguayan Government may be compelled to control imports in order to
                                safeguard foreign debt service and other necessary remittances
                                abroad and to protect the exchange value of the Uruguayan currency
                                during periods of foreign exchange stringency due to abnormally low
                                returns from exports. However, the Government of the United States
                                believes that any control of imports deemed necessary by the
                                Uruguayan Government can be exercised more effectively and more
                                fairly on a commodity basis than, as at present, on a country
                                basis.</p>
                            <p>The control of imports on a commodity basis would permit the control
                                of total imports, whereas the present practice may result in a
                                diversion of imports from a disfavored to a favored nation and thus
                                cause only a change in the source of imports. The control of imports
                                on a commodity basis would be more fair than the existing practice
                                because all suppliers to the Uruguayan market and Uruguayan
                                importers would receive equitable treatment with respect to such
                                imports as were admitted and the burden of restrictions would be
                                spread over all export and import interests involved in the trade in
                                the articles subject to restrictions. Even in the worst years, many
                                articles could be permitted to enter without any restriction
                                whatever. In the case of articles subject to restriction Uruguayan
                                importers would be free to buy where they could buy to best
                                advantage, within the limits determined upon by the Uruguayan
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Under the procedure here suggested, import quotas, applicable to
                                imports of particular products from all countries, could be
                                established when necessary for the protection of the exchange value
                                of the Uruguayan currency. The maximum quantity of a given product
                                which would be admitted into Uruguay during a specified period,
                                including any imports of such product under compensation
                                arrangements, would not have to be allocated among supplying
                                countries. However, if the Uruguayan Government should allocate a
                                share of <pb n="790" xml:id="pg_790" facs="0798"/>any such quantity
                                to any third country, the United States would be allotted a fair
                                share on the basis of its position as a supplier in a previous
                                representative period. The previous representative period upon which
                                the share of the United States in a total quota would be based would
                                not necessarily be specified in the agreement. The Uruguayan
                                Government would be free to select a base period for each product
                                subject to an import quota on the general understanding that the
                                period selected would be representative with respect to imports into
                                Uruguay of the product in question. If shares of a quota are
                                allotted to a third country and to the United States on this basis,
                                the balance, if any, of the quota over and above these shares could,
                                if the Uruguayan Government so desires, be made available to all
                                other countries without specific allocation to such countries, or be
                                allotted among several countries or even entirely to one other
                                country. It is assumed, however, that the Uruguayan Government would
                                as a general rule wish to allocate the balance, which in some cases
                                would be a large part of the total quota, among other exporting
                                countries on the same basis as that on which the allocation to the
                                United States would be made.</p>
                            <p>Such control of imports, based on careful estimates of exchange
                                available for merchandise transactions after the debt service and
                                other necessary remittances have been provided for and with
                                sufficient flexibility for any revision of such estimates as might
                                appear advisable, would insure that imports would not exceed
                                Uruguay’s capacity to pay. Thus the present basis for the allocation
                                or non-allocation of exchange quotas and differential exchange rates
                                as between countries would be removed and since only an amount of
                                imports would be admitted for which exchange was available, payment
                                could be made promptly for all imports.</p>
                            <p>There are attached a set of general provisions which the Government
                                of the United States would wish to have included in a trade
                                agreement, together with a memorandum explaining the articles
                                pertinent to the above discussion.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the third element in the basis for negotiations,
                                the Government of the United States would expect the Uruguayan
                                Government to grant, under a trade agreement, improvement in customs
                                treatment,—that is, in the total charges resulting from the
                                combination of official valuation, base duty, surtaxes, and gold
                                surcharge,—to important United States products, including: <list>

                                products of which the United States is the principal or an important

                            <p>The Government of Uruguay, like the Government of the United States,
                                doubtless has been giving intensive study to the possibilities of a
                                trade agreement and is therefore in a position to indicate at an
                                early date the concessions it would expect the United States to
                                grant in a trade agreement.</p>
                            <p>The view has been expressed that, because of the similarity in
                                important respects between the export trade of Uruguay and Argentina
                                with the United States, the negotiation of trade agreements between
                                the United States and Uruguay and between the United States and
                                Argentina should take place simultaneously.</p>
                            <p>Similar considerations and questions regarding the basis for a trade
                                agreement are also being presented to the Government of Argentina.
                                In the event it should be impossible to reach agreement as to the
                                basis for a trade agreement with the Argentine Government, it would
                                be necessary for the Government of the United States to reconsider,
                                in the light of those circumstances, the question of a trade
                                agreement with Uruguay.</p>
                            <p>It is obviously desirable that both Governments make every effort to
                                avoid any publicity in regard to any proposals under discussion or
                                to the fact that such discussions are in progress.</p>

                        <p>66. Referring to the Legation’s telegram No. 59, September 1, 5 p.m.<note n="8" xml:id="d727fn8">Not printed.</note> In conversation with the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday and today he stated that the Bank
                            of the Republic has made a partial reply to the memorandum transmitted
                            by the Legation to the Foreign Office,<note n="9" xml:id="d727fn9">
                        <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> its examination of the question
                            being limited to the provisions governing exchange control and the
                            exchange policy, not, however, attempting to go into the matter of
                            tariffs. The Minister stated that the bank officials have expressed
                            themselves as being keenly interested at this particular time in the
                            negotiation of a commercial treaty with the United States. The Minister
                            pointed out that the negotiation of an agreement between Argentina and
                            the United States and the failure to negotiate a similar agreement
                            between Uruguay and the United States would be extremely disadvantageous
                            for Uruguay <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0800"/>since Uruguay’s
                            export products to the United States are virtually the same as those
                            exported by Argentina. The Minister then said that his Government
                            desires to grant all the necessary facilities to enable the negotiations
                            to be conducted simultaneously (<hi rend="italic">paralelamente</hi>)
                            with those of Argentina and for that reason he desires to be informed if
                            possible at the earliest possible moment of the point to which those
                            negotiations have progressed to date. He mentioned also that the present
                            international situation serves to make more feasible the negotiations of
                            such a treaty at this particular time. I gained the unmistakable
                            impression that Dr. Guani is not in entire sympathy with the trade
                            policy which Uruguay has been pursuing during the past years and would
                            be glad to bring about a change.</p>
                        <p>In addition the Minister expressed the wish that the tone of the
                            Legation’s telegram be decidedly optimistic toward the ultimate
                            negotiation of a trade agreement, as he is very desirous that such a
                            treaty be consummated. He remarked that the questions of tariffs and of
                            exchange are highly technical and should be discussed by technical
                            experts from each country and that if the United States desired to send
                            experts here it would be gratifying to him. He said that Uruguay has the
                            same obstacles confronting it in the way of certain bilateral treaties
                            as has Argentina and should be equally as able to negotiate a treaty at
                            this time. He further stated that his Government is ready to proceed
                            toward a formal announcement of intention to negotiate a treaty but with
                            the understanding that prior consultations shall take place between the
                            two Governments to enable each party to formulate a previous declaration

                        <p>52. Your 66 of September 7, 5 p.m. You should inform the Foreign Minister
                            that your Government is extremely gratified to learn of the desire of
                            his Government to negotiate a trade agreement and express the hope that
                            notice of intention to negotiate can be given at an early date.</p>

                            connection with the proposed agreement with Argentina, you may say that

                            mutually satisfactory basis for public announcement on August 23 of
                            intention to negotiate.<note n="10" xml:id="d728fn10">Department of

                            being carried on in Buenos Aires. It is anticipated that definitive
                            negotiations will take place in Washington beginning during the week of
                            October 23.</p>
                        <p>In the light of your telegram under reference and the procedure followed
                            in the case of Argentina, you should endeavor to obtain a written reply
                            to this Government’s memorandum of last June. The reply should indicate
                            clearly that the Government of Uruguay understands fully what our
                            proposal means, particularly in respect of quantitative restrictions and
                            exchange, with a view to obviating the necessity for extended
                            discussions in advance of public notice of intention to negotiate. We
                            should like to be able to include a statement similar to that quoted
                            above in a press release announcing negotiations with Uruguay. It should
                            be made clear to the Foreign Minister that the list of products upon
                            which this Government will consider granting concessions in a trade
                            agreement is published at the time of public announcement and that no
                            commitments with respect thereto can be made until all interested
                            parties have had an opportunity to present their views thereon either in
                            writing or at public hearings which are held about eight weeks after
                            public announcement. The list in the case of Uruguay would be the same
                            as that included with this Government’s memorandum of last June, with
                            information as to present rates of duty, and would be headed “List of
                            products upon which the United States will consider granting concessions
                            to Uruguay”.</p>
                        <p>Should the Uruguayan Government desire to follow a similar procedure and
                            publish a list of products upon which it will consider granting
                            concessions to the United States, the list to be published should, of
                            course, be cleared with this Government before publication. <pb n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0802"/>Since this Government can not formulate
                            definitively the concessions it will request of Uruguay prior to the
                            public hearings here, any list published by the Uruguayan Government
                            should be extensive enough to cover all products of which the United
                            States is the principal or an important supplier to Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>Please telegraph the substance of the formal response to our proposals as
                            soon as possible after its receipt.</p>

                        <p>74. Referring to the Department’s telegram No. 52, September 11, 7 p.m.
                            The Foreign Minister received me yesterday at which time the substance
                            of the Department’s telegram was fully discussed. He informed me that
                            earlier in the day he had had a conversation with the President of the
                            Republic on the subject and that in the light of the information as
                            presented in the Department’s telegram and as developed in our
                            conversation he would immediately review all the details and be prepared
                            to discuss the matter further with the President on Monday September 18
                            and that he would get in touch with me again on the 19th.</p>
                        <p>I took the occasion to show him the text of Ambassador Espil’s Washington
                            statement, Mr. Welles’ statement of August 23<note n="11" xml:id="d729fn11">Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 26, 1939, p. 166.</note> and the
                            Argentine Government’s communiqué, all as published in English in the
                                <hi rend="italic">Buenos Aires Herald</hi> (which he said he had not
                            seen) and a full discussion thereof ensued after which he ordered an
                            immediate translation stating that this information concerning the
                            Argentine negotiations would be most helpful to him in the preparation
                            of his reply to our Government’s memorandum of last June.</p>
                        <p>I left with him a memorandum embodying the Department’s telegram under
                            acknowledgment and he stated that the details as now presented are
                            clearly understood and remarked that “apparently the next step then is a
                            public announcement of the intention to negotiate” in which I concurred
                            pointing out however the necessity of an early written reply to the
                            Department’s memorandum and the prior establishment of a satisfactory
                            basis for public announcement.</p>

                            <p>“With reference to the Legation’s note dated July 10, 1939,
                                transmitting the memorandum of the Department of State of June 28,
                                and to the conversations held regarding plans for the negotiations
                                of a commercial treaty between our Government and the Government of
                                the United States of America I have pleasure in confirming herewith,
                                Mr. Chargé d’Affaires, that Uruguay likewise desires sincerely that
                                international commerce be conducted on multilateral bases and with
                                minimum of obstacles and difficulties.</p>
                            <p>The bilateral agreements which Uruguay has made with countries which
                                at present purchase the greater part of its products are due,
                                generally, to the desire of those countries that the exchange
                                created by their purchases be devoted preferentially to the payment
                                of the financial and commercial services which Uruguay owes
                                them.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States of America recognizes that our
                                Government is compelled to exercise control over imports with a view
                                to safeguarding the service of the foreign debt and other
                                remittances of funds abroad and to protect the exchange rate of
                                Uruguayan currency during periods of foreign exchange
                                difficulties.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States recognizing the necessity of this
                                measure, it is possible, in the opinion of the Uruguayan Government,
                                that the control may be effected on the basis of quantitative
                                regulation as suggested by the Government of the United States, it
                                being admitted also that this system of regulation may be implanted
                                without causing disturbances in the commerce which the Republic is
                                maintaining with other countries, provided that action in this
                                regard is exercised with the elasticity of viewpoint demonstrated in
                                the memorandum under acknowledgment.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States of America has borne in mind, at
                                the same time, the importance which we attribute to the meat trade,
                                examining carefully the points relative to the imports of canned or
                                frozen meats from Uruguay. The procedures which it proposes for the
                                study of the sanitary laws and regulations now in force encourage
                                the hope that there may be obtained a change favorable to us as
                                regards the present situation.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, our Government is in agreement in that there be made
                                the announcement of a formal intention to negotiate a treaty of
                                commerce between both countries and expresses its conformity with
                                the regime of quantitative regulation referred to above.</p>
                            <p>The projected commercial agreement will provide assurance that
                                imports into Uruguay coming from the United States of America will
                                    <pb n="796" xml:id="pg_796" facs="0804"/>receive any advantage
                                that may be granted for imports from any other sources and that all
                                governmental regulation of imports into Uruguay will be applied in a

                                been promoted, the conditions which it would expect from the

                        <p>60. Your telegram no. 81, October 9, 11 p.m. You should immediately
                            inform the Uruguayan Foreign Minister that this Government greatly
                            appreciates the consideration given its proposals by the Uruguayan
                            Government, and is deeply gratified that the Uruguayan Government’s
                            reply of October 9 indicates that apparent agreement has been reached
                            between the two Governments as to the general basis for the negotiation
                            of a trade agreement. You should inform the Foreign Minister that his
                            Government’s reply is now under consideration by the trade-agreements
                            organization of this Government with a view to the issuance of a public
                            announcement of intention to negotiate a trade agreement at an early
                            date, possibly on October 16, if agreeable to the Government of
                            Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, it is necessary to obtain the Uruguayan Government’s agreement
                            to the list of products on which the United States will consider
                            granting concessions, which list must be published with the
                            announcement. The need for raising the latter question with the Foreign
                            Minister is suggested by the reference in his note to the formulation of
                            Uruguay’s requests for concessions after the announcement has been made
                            here. In this connection you should explain that under our procedure all
                            products on which this Government will consider granting concessions
                            must be published with the announcement: that the purpose is to obtain
                            the views of interested persons in this country on the granting of
                            concessions on such products; and that any product not listed cannot be
                            considered in the negotiations. The list of products enclosed with this
                            Government’s memorandum of June 28, 1939 is based on exhaustive study of
                            our import trade with <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0805"/>Uruguay
                            in the light of the rule generally followed by this Government of
                            granting concessions on specific products only in trade agreements with
                            the principal or an important supplier of such products. You should
                            endeavor to obtain the prompt assent of the Uruguayan Government to the
                            publication of this list as including all the products to which
                            consideration will be given. You will, of course, make it clear that the
                            inclusion of any product in the published list means only that it will
                            be considered, since specific concessions cannot be determined in
                            advance of negotiations and prior to public announcement and hearings in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>If the Uruguayan officials indicate any desire that this Government
                            consider adding products to the above-mentioned list, you should point
                            out that the necessary consideration which would have to be given to any
                            additional products and the unlikelihood that any would be found which
                            could be added to the list would only mean unnecessary delay in issuing
                            the public announcement here and consequently in the initiation of
                            definitive negotiations.</p>
                        <p>You should ascertain whether the Uruguayan Government would have any
                            objection to this Government’s making the following statement in
                            connection with the public announcement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Imports into Uruguay from certain countries, with which Uruguay

                                    from the United States. The Government of Uruguay has agreed
                                    that the proposed trade agreement will be based upon the
                                    principles of multilateral trade which underlie the
                                    trade-agreements program of the United States. The proposed
                                    trade agreement will assure that imports into Uruguay from the
                                    United States will be accorded any advantage given competing
                                    imports from any other source and that any governmental
                                    regulation of imports into Uruguay will be applied in a

                        <p>63. Tour telegram no. 85, October 16, 7 p.m. You should inform the
                            Uruguayan Foreign Minister that public notice of intention to negotiate
                            will be released here for publication in the morning papers of October
                                20.<note n="15" xml:id="d733fn15">Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 21, 1939, p.

                  </p>
                        <p>While definitive negotiations can not be initiated until after the
                            completion of the public hearings here, if agreeable to the Uruguayan
                            officials it would be desirable to undertake the negotiations of the
                            general provisions and discussion of other matters as rapidly as
                            possible after the issuance of the public notice and the Department will
                            instruct you shortly in this regard.</p>
                        <p>You should ascertain the attitude of the Uruguayan officials toward
                            holding the definitive negotiations in Washington. You should state that
                            your Government believes that this would be highly desirable. You should
                            also state, however, that it would be desirable to avoid the arrival of
                            a trade delegation here before the close of the period allowed for
                            written briefs. The Department will advise you of the date on which this
                            period will end.</p>
                        <p>With reference to that part of the Foreign Minister’s note of October 16,
                            1939, which states “the list of products on which the Government of the
                            United States considers itself prepared to grant at this time
                            concessions to the Government of Uruguay”, you should point out to the
                            Foreign Minister that the list referred to is a list of products on
                            which this Government will consider granting concessions to Uruguay and
                            that, as stated in the Department’s telegram no. 60 of October 10,
                            specific concessions can not be determined in advance of negotiations
                            and prior to public notice and hearings in the United States.</p>

                        <p>87. The substance of the Department’s telegram No. 63, October 17, 6
                            p.m., has been discussed at length with the Foreign Minister who
                            understands clearly all points raised. I expressed to him my
                            Government’s belief that it would be highly desirable to hold the
                            definitive negotiations in Washington whereupon he requested me to say
                            that the Uruguayan Government would like to have the definitive
                            negotiations conducted as in the case of Argentina. He believes that if
                            the United States Government is sending a trade delegation of experts to
                            Buenos Aires the same delegation might then come to Montevideo to
                            conduct the negotiations here. He further stated that if it should be
                            the case that Argentina is sending a trade delegation to the United
                            States, Uruguay would do the same.</p>

                        <p>65. Your telegram no. 87, October 19, 5 p.m. You should inform the
                            Foreign Minister that our Embassy at Buenos Aires, assisted by experts
                            sent from here, will conduct the negotiations with Argentina. Since, in
                            those circumstances, it is the desire of the Uruguayan officials that
                            our negotiations with them take place in Montevideo, they will be
                            conducted through the Legation and we will arrange to have the experts
                            we are sending to Buenos Aires consult with and assist the Legation as
                            need arises.</p>
                        <p>To avoid loss of time, you should begin at once discussions in regard to
                            the general provisions of the proposed agreement, on the basis of the
                            draft attached to this Government’s memorandum of June 28, instruction
                            no. 152 of that date. Instructions regarding the release of concessions
                            will be sent you later.</p>
                        <p>You should call upon William A. Fowler, Assistant Chief of the Division
                            of Trade Agreements, who is now proceeding to Buenos Aires on the S. S.
                                <hi rend="italic">Uruguay</hi>, to assist you in these discussions
                            to the extent permitted by the trade-agreement work in Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>We are instructing the Embassy at Buenos Aires to send you comments on
                            the general provisions, a copy of which you should transmit to the
                            Uruguayan officials. These comments, which outline the purposes intended
                            to be accomplished by the various Articles of the general <pb n="801" xml:id="pg_801" facs="0809"/>provisions, should be helpful in your
                            discussions. For additional comments in regard to the purpose and
                            application of the Articles on quantitative restrictions, Articles VII
                            and VIII, and the Article on exchange, Article X, which are of
                            particular importance in the case of Uruguay, you should refer to the
                            pertinent parts of the above-mentioned memorandum of June 28. Report
                            fully to the Department regarding these discussions and request such
                            telegraphic instructions as you think necessary in regard to difficult
                            points encountered.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy at Buenos Aires will also send you a draft Article X relative
                            to exchange. You should inform the Uruguayan officials that it is
                            desired that this draft Article be substituted for the Article of the
                            same number included in the general provisions enclosed with the
                            memorandum of June 28. Although the new draft is substantially the same
                            as the old, it is briefer and for that reason is considered
                            preferable.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report hereinafter
                            developments regarding the trade agreement negotiations since my arrival
                            at this post on October 23d:</p>
                        <p>On October 24 Mr. Dwyre informed the Foreign Minister by note (copy
                                enclosed)<note n="18" xml:id="d737fn18">Not printed.</note> that the
                            United States Government would be glad, <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0810"/>since the negotiations with Argentina were to be held
                            in Buenos Aires, to meet the wishes of the Uruguayan Government and have
                            the Uruguayan negotiations take place in Montevideo. The note expressed
                            the desire that conversations on the general provisions be begun as soon
                            as possible. In handing the note to Dr. Guani, Mr. Dwyre mentioned that
                            we had just received an explanatory memorandum regarding the general
                            provisions, as well as a new and briefer draft of Article X, and that we
                            would make a Spanish translation of the memorandum and draft article and
                            furnish copies to the Foreign Office (English and Spanish texts of the
                            memorandum and Article X were sent to Dr. Guani on October 26).</p>
                        <p>When I called on Dr. Guani for the first time, on October 25th, I took
                            occasion to discuss the trade agreement at some length. I said that I
                            and the members of my staff were wholly at the disposal of himself and
                            the Uruguayan officials for discussions at any moment on the trade
                            agreement. When we had advanced matters somewhat, and whenever it would
                            be helpful, I was sure that we could have Mr. Fowler and Mr. Allen come
                            over from Buenos Aires. I said that although we were beginning later
                            than the Argentine negotiations, I hoped we might make every effort to
                            advance our work so that the two agreements could be brought into force
                            at about the same time. I then went on to express a personal opinion,
                            about as follows: that I had noted the existence in the United States,
                            and the Minister had undoubtedly noted it as well, of opposition in
                            certain quarters to the type of trade agreement which we hoped to make
                            between the United States and Argentina and Uruguay. It had required an
                            act of courage on the part of the Administration in Washington to
                            announce intention to negotiate these agreements. The Trade Agreements
                            Act expires next June, and it might or might not be renewed; in any
                            case, next year would be a year of general elections in the United
                            States. It seemed to me that here was an opportunity, which might not
                            present itself again, for us to place our trade relations on a proper
                            basis, and we ought to make every effort to take advantage of it and to
                            wind up our negotiations by the first of the year, if at all
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Guani said that he was in full agreement; that he intended to set up
                            an inter-Ministerial committee to work on the problem, and that he hoped
                            to be ready, in two weeks time, to begin conversations on the general
                            provisions.</p>
                        <p>I also mentioned the unfortunate effect of publicity given to the
                            possibility of concessions on meat products, as reported in my telegram
                            No. 91 of October 25—5 p.m.<note n="19" xml:id="d737fn19">Not

                  </p>
                        <p>When I was received by President Baldomir on October 27th, I referred to
                            the trade agreement negotiations and spoke on much the <pb n="803" xml:id="pg_803" facs="0811"/>same lines as to Dr. Guani. The
                            President seemed interested and expressed his best wishes for the early
                            and successful conclusion of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In calling on the Minister of Finance, Dr. Charlone, on October 28th, I
                            spoke of my hope, for the reasons already mentioned, that we might make
                            rapid progress. He said that he was in full agreement, and that
                            everything which he and his services could do to advance the
                            negotiations, would be done. He asked if Mr. Fowler had arrived in
                            Buenos Aires, and said that he would look forward to seeing him again in
                            Montevideo, as he recalled with pleasure their conversations last
                            January.</p>
                        <p>I had a further conversation with Dr. Guani on October 28th, when I
                            informed him that I had learned that in the negotiations in Buenos Aires
                            it had been found helpful to set up general committees, composed
                            respectively of representatives of the Embassy and of the competent
                            Argentine Ministries, and subcommittees as well, and I suggested that we
                            might follow the same procedure. Dr. Guani thought this a good idea, and
                            promised again to advise me as soon as he was prepared to begin
                            discussion of the general provisions.</p>
                        <p>My impression, from such talks as I have had to date, is that the
                            Uruguayan officials probably have not gone very far with their study of
                            the proposed trade agreement. I expect that we shall encounter much
                            delay. It was surprising to find that Dr. Guani was ignorant of the fact
                            that our government can conclude trade agreements which enter into
                            effect without necessity of ratification by the Senate. He expressed
                            interest in our Trade Agreements Act, which he said he had never read,
                            and I at once sent him a copy of the Act. President Baldomir seemed to
                            be under the impression that the trade agreement was practically on the
                            point of being concluded. It is probable that in the Ministry of Finance
                            and the Bank of the Republic more familiarity with the details of the
                            subject will be found. I am told by some well informed people, however,
                            that it is precisely in those quarters that opposition to the agreement
                            exists.</p>
                        <p>I shall, of course, continue to try in every appropriate way to make
                            progress in this matter.</p>

                        <p>1. Our trade-agreement negotiations with Argentina have broken down and
                            it is expected that early next week an official statement will be issued
                            by the two Governments in regard to the termination of the
                                negotiations.<note n="20" xml:id="d738fn20">See press release issued

                            which negotiations were initiated with Uruguay, it is necessary to
                            terminate also the trade-agreement negotiations with that country.
                            Accordingly, we will say only that, since the negotiations with
                            Argentina and Uruguay are closely interrelated, we are terminating the
                            negotiations with Uruguay also.</p>
                        <p>Please advise the appropriate Uruguayan officials and express our deep
                            regret at having to take this action.</p>
                        <p>You should also express our hope that the Uruguayan officials, in any
                            statement they may make, will continue to treat the subject matter of
                            the negotiations as confidential. Please send a copy of this telegram to
                            the Embassy at Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p>The Department of State announced today that trade-agreement negotiations
                            with Uruguay had been terminated. These negotiations have been conducted
                            in an atmosphere of the utmost friendliness and cordiality. However,
                            because of the similarity in important respects of the export trade of
                            Uruguay and Argentina with the United States, it has been found
                            necessary, in view of the recent termination of negotiations with
                            Argentina, to terminate also the negotiations with Uruguay.</p>

                        <p>31. Telegram No. 41 April 27, noon, from Daniels. Although instructions
                            to Daniels regarding the proposed trade agreement with Venezuela are now
                            under consideration, and it is hoped that they will be sent him within
                            the next few days, it would be impossible in any case, for an agreement
                            to be concluded and in effect before the expiration on May 11 of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of May 12, 1938. Consequently, in
