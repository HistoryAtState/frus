                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the formulation of policies, including the events which contributed to
                    that process, and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the
                    policy positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, <hi
                        rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>
                <p>The General Editor of the series and the editor of this volume, which was
                    compiled in 1980–1981, are convinced that it meets all regulatory, statutory,
                    and scholarly standards of selection and editing. Although this volume records
                    policies and events of more than 30 years ago, the statute of October 28, 1991,
                    allows the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line in the publication of
                    the series.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series. This subseries documents the most important
                    issues in the foreign policy of the final three years (1958–1960) of the
                    administration of <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName>.
                    Within the 1958–1960 subseries, six volumes and four microfiche supplements
                    present the record of U.S. policy toward East Asia. This volume presents
                    documentation on U.S. policy toward Indonesia. <ref target="frus1958-60v18"

                    includes an overview of U.S. regional policy for East Asia as well as extensive

                <p>Additional documents on Indonesia are presented in a microfiche supplement to
                    this volume (which also includes documents from <ref target="frus1958-60v18"
                        >Volume XVIII</ref>) and additional material on the rest of Asia is in

                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government cooperate with
                    the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to
                    records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing
                    copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of access to
                    documentation this volume meets the standards and mandates of this statute.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations

                <p>The editor responsible for research, selection, and annotation of this volume,
                        <persName>Robert J. McMahon</persName>, had complete access to all the
                    retired records and papers in the Department of State: the central files of the
                    Department; the decentralized (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau,
                    office, and division levels; the files of the Department’s Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V"
                        facs="0009"/>files of overseas diplomatic posts. Any failure to include a
                    complete Department of State record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series cannot be attributed to constraints or limitations
                    placed upon the Department historians in their access to Department records,
                    information security regulations and practices notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>The editor of this volume fully researched the papers of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and other White House foreign policy
                    records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Presidential
                    libraries include some of the most significant foreign affairs-related
                    documentation from other federal agencies including the National Security
                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. All of this documentation has been made available for use
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of
                    these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians have also enjoyed steadily broadened access to
                    records of the Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and his major assistants.</p>
                <p>As noted above, the statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the editors have
                    full and complete access to all records pertinent to foreign policy decisions
                    and actions. The research, compiling, and editing of this volume, however, were
                    completed in 1981, with limited, back-ground only, access to Central
                    Intelligence Agency records. Since early 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency,
                    in cooperation with the Department of State, has provided expanded access to
                    Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those records
                    still in the custody of that Agency. Submitting such documents for
                    declassification review would have necessitated considerable delay in the
                    publication of the volume, however, and the Department chose not to postpone
                    publication. The Department of State historians’ expanded access was arranged by
                    the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central
                    Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>Apart from this exception, this volume was prepared in a manner consonant with
                    the standards and mandates of the statute. The List of Sources, pages XIII–XVI,
                    identifies the particular files and collections used in the preparation of this
                    volume.</p>

                    relations with Indonesia and the Netherlands. Indonesian claims to West New
                    Guinea-West Irian made the Netherlands Government a more than interested <pb

                    Policy recommendations to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                        >Eisenhower</persName> and his decisions with respect to government policies
                    and actions are documented as fully as possible. Discussions and actions of the
                    National Security Council and Presidential discussions of policy with
                    Cabinet-level officers are included.</p>
                <p>During the years 1958–1960, the Department of State played a leading role in the
                    formulation of U.S. foreign policy. Secretaries of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_DJF1">John Foster Dulles</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Christian A. Herter</persName> drew upon the Department’s
                    expertise in advising the President and taking leading roles in the
                    deliberations of the National Security Council. The editor sought to include
                    material documenting their roles and, where relevant, the interaction of the
                    Department of State with the Department of Defense or other government agencies.
                    Reportage and intelligence estimates that were seen by high-level policymakers
                    and may have influenced their policy decisions have also been included.</p>
                <p>The editor sought to document as comprehensively as possible the implementation
                    of U.S. policies toward Indonesia through exchanges between high-level U.S.
                    officials and foreign government officials on key issues that were of primary
                    concern to the policymakers at the time. The editor made no attempt to document
                    the whole range of day-to-day relationships, issues, and contacts between the
                    United States and Indonesia.</p>

                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. Missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editor
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0011"/>source text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in chronological order. The amount of material omitted
                    because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume, however, has not been
                    delineated. All ellipses and brackets that appear in the source text are so
                    identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document’s source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts have been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    Title IV of the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act, amended on October
                    28, 1991, reviews records, advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors
                    the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and assists with any
                    access and/or clearance problems that arise. Time constraints prevent the
                    Advisory Committee from reviewing all volumes in the series. The Advisory
                    Committee did not review this volume.</p>

                <p>The declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1993, resulted
                    in the decision to withhold 1.7 percent of the documents originally selected by
                    Department of State historians and proposed for publication in this volume. The
                    most important portions of the documents <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII"
                        facs="0012"/>withheld from publication as a result of the declassification
                    review were those relating to the details of U.S. covert support of the
                    Indonesian rebellion in Sumatra and Sulawesi (Celebes) and to liaison with other
                    countries interested and involved in this operation. For the first time since
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes on Vietnam for 1963 were
                    published, the U.S. Government has acknowledged the existence of and policy
                    deliberations about a major covert operation. In this respect, <ref
                        target="frus1958-60v17">Volume XVII</ref> is a transitional volume on the
                    road to fuller release of information of important intelligence operations.
                    Although the details are lacking, there is ample evidence that the United States
                    encouraged and supported the rebellion until it was clear that it was failing.
                    Then the United States shifted its policy toward support of the Indonesian
                    military as the best bulwark against communism in Indonesia. In its general
                    outline of these policies, the published record regarding policy toward
                    Indonesia meets generally accepted scholarly standards of accuracy and
                    completeness.</p>
                <p>Although the details of U.S. intelligence operations in Indonesia cannot be
                    published here, the editors regard the record as important to a public
                    understanding of U.S. foreign policy toward an important country of East Asia.
                    The statute of 1991 establishes a 30-year publication line for the series, and
                    thus the foreign affairs record for the administration of <persName
                        corresp="#p_EDD1">Dwight D. Eisenhower</persName> must now be published. At
                    such time as the remainder of the details of intelligence operations in
                    Indonesia can be declassified as promised by the Central Intelligence Agency,
                    consistent with national security criteria, the Department will take steps to
                    disclose and publish it in an appropriate format.</p>
                <p>The Department of State’s Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation has been apprised of the Department’s decisions regarding
                    declassification review of this volume.</p>
                <p>Those documents omitted in their entirety from this volume are identified (by
                    description, date, and archival provenance) in the text where they would have
                    been printed. Excisions from printed texts are identified by suitable editorial

                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific

                        <p>Late in December 1956 regional dissatisfaction with the Central
                            Government erupted into proclamations of defiance of central authority
                            issued by Army-led local “councils” in the outer islands. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> proposed as a
                            solution to the Cabinet crisis growing out of this development the
                            formation of a new government in which all major parties, including the
                            Communist, would be represented, and the creation of a National Council
                            representing the “functional groups” in society to advise the
                            government. He also advocated an ill-defined political theory of “guided
                            democracy” which appeared to be inspired by the material accomplishments
                            if not the ideology of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and Communist China.
                            The new government formed in the spring of 1957, while without open
                            Communist party representation, included three extreme leftists, and the
                            National Council created shortly thereafter had a strong leftist
                            representation. In Regional Council elections on Java during the late
                            spring and early summer of 1957, the Communists scored substantial
                            gains. Because of the indications of progressive growth in Communist
                            strength and concern that anti-Communist forces <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2"
                                facs="0028"/>on Java were unwilling or unable to resist adequately
                            this trend, a special group was appointed by the National Security
                            Council on August 1 to evaluate developments in Indonesia and submit
                            recommendations on what action the United States should take. The
                            Committee’s Report, which was submitted to the National Security Council
                            at its meeting on September 23, can be summarized as follows:<note n="1"

                        <p>The Committee finds that the most promising approach for the United
                            States at this stage of developments in Indonesia lies in exploiting the
                            political resources and economic leverage available in the outer islands
                            and recommends that we utilize and develop these assets. Specifically

                                    position on Par. 9 of the paper. Defense representatives took
                                    the position that not only should the United States Government
                                    proceed with planning for action in case the Communists gain
                                    control of Java or having gained control of Java attempt to
                                    acquire control over the outer islands, but also that we should
                                    at this time decide that we will act under such circumstances if
                                    necessary with U.S. armed forces. The Department’s position was
                                    that we should go no farther at this stage than to plan for such
                                    an eventuality in accordance with the provision of Par. 12 of

                            present at the meeting, will wish to brief you on implementation of the
                            Report in the covert field. A summary of the pending requests from the
                            Indonesian Government and of the status of our overt programs is

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM3">Allison</persName> had certain
                            reservations concerning the Report of the Special Committee and was of
                            the opinion that certain possible courses of action which might have
                            been helpful had not been considered. He was of the opinion that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not “beyond
                            redemption” and that it was still possible to reduce his reliance on the
                            Communists. He also felt that we should support the Indonesian position
                            on West Irian as a means of winning <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> over, at the same time weakening the Communist
                            position in Indonesia. The Ambassador has also felt that we should have
                            supported the efforts of the present Indonesian Government since, in his
                            opinion, the main influences in the Cabinet are non-Communist. He has
                            also felt that we should make an effort to influence President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> through <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>, who is a moderate. The
                            Ambassador has also made specific recommendations on the sale of
                            military equipment to Indonesia and the extension of economic aid. A

                            who might do something about it.” He also said that we should be very
                            clear, both with the Dutch and with any others, that we did not mean
                            that in backing a government we would support all of its policies and in
                            particular its West Irian policy.</p>

                            We should also avoid the impression we were trying to force <persName

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AJM3">Allison</persName> believes
                            support of the Indonesian position on West New Guinea is a requisite but
                            also the only thing required to get <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> over to our way of thinking. He believes that we
                            need only to support this government and the Moderates will prevail.</p>
                        <p>There was agreement that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was in fact wholly undependable. The Secretary
                            at one point indicated his view that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was dangerous and untrustworthy and by character
                            susceptible to the Communist way of thinking.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reported that the
                            Dutch position now is that they could not possibly talk with the
                            Indonesians since the blackmail conditions had been laid on by the
                            Indonesians. <persName>Johnny Jones</persName> noted also that the Dutch
                            position on shipment of any arms would be extremely strong because of
                            the possibility that arms would be used against the Dutch in an attempt
                            forcibly to take over West New Guinea. <persName corresp="#p_MJG1"

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2"
                                >Van Roijen</persName> noted that the situation in Indonesia looks
                            bad. He said that 10,000 Dutch nationals left Indonesia in December. In
                            response to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KD5">Ketel</persName>
                            said that there were approximately 46,000 Dutch nationals in Indonesia
                            as of November, of whom approximately 20,000 are believed to be Dutch
                            ethnically as well as from the point of view of citizenship.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van
                                Roijen</persName> said that he believed <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> suffered a severe nervous
                            shock as a result of the attempted assassination in late November and
                            needs a real rest. An additional consideration in the present
                            Presidential trip<note n="1" xml:id="d3fn1">President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was scheduled to embark
                                on January 6 on a 6-week tour of Asia and the Middle East.</note> is
                            that he <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0033"/>planned to visit Latin
                            America about this time and had been prevailed upon by the political
                            parties to postpone that official trip. His present journey now becomes
                            a matter of pleasure as well as a face saving device. The Ambassador
                            thought that during his absence the chances would be better for
                            obtaining a favorable change in the Government. In reply to a further
                            question, when asked by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> whether there was any strong man in Indonesia
                            to replace <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, the
                            Ambassador said that he has confidence in <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName>, who has the backbone to resist what he believes
                            should not be done but who does not have the drive necessary for an
                            active counter-policy. The Ambassador continued that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wants <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> to return to the Government as
                            Vice President, a position which <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> refuses to accept because it does not meet the
                            conditions, such as abolition of the National Council, which <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> has laid down for re-establishing
                            his collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName>, in his recent attack upon the Government,
                            criticized only the Government’s methods and timing of taking over the
                            Dutch interests and did not oppose the principle involved.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the clock could not be turned back in Indonesia
                            and that even if a moderate government came in, it could not be expected
                            to reverse the present anti-Dutch trend. He said that the Dutch are
                            convinced the game is up for them and eventually for the West in
                            Indonesia. The anti-Dutch campaign may have been triggered off by New
                            Guinea but, he said, “Even if we gave them New Guinea on a silver
                            platter, another excuse would have been found.”</p>
                        <p>When asked if he had any hope for Indonesia Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> stated that it depends upon
                            the moderates. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said
                            that the Army is now begging us for arms but that we have not responded
                            due to the threats to take New Guinea by force, the unlawful seizure of
                            private property and the uncertainties as to the future orientation of
                            the Government. He also mentioned that large elements of the Army are
                            opposed to the current drift towards the Communists and do not want the
                            Army to become dependent upon the Soviet bloc equipment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> was emphatic
                            that under present circumstances to give arms to Indonesia would be most
                            unfortunate, for if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            gets arms, it will give the impression that his activities have a seal
                            of approval from the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that we had
                            never considered giving arms to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> but asked the question of the Dutch attitude if
                            there were a coup in Indonesia and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> departed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> replied that
                            any arms sent to Indonesia would be to the credit of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He believed Army Chief of
                            Staff <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is an opportunist
                            although if there were a coup or an attempted coup by the Communists he
                            might turn against them. He believed <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0034"
                            />that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has penetrated the Army
                            in about the same percentage, both of officers and men, as the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has penetrated the population. He noted
                            that Deputy Army Chief of State [<hi rend="italic">Staff</hi>?] Gatot
                            Subroto, while pro-western, is a Japanese and therefore has a
                            disadvantage in the eyes of the military leaders in the outer-islands.
                            After noting that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> seems
                            disinclined to take any long risks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> asked if the Ambassador believed Indonesia is
                            lost to the free world. The Ambassador replied that Java will go
                            Communist if it continues along the same lines as it is now proceeding.
                            In reply to a further question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> the Ambassador said that force might have to
                            be used to protect the outer-islands should the Communists take over
                            Java. He believes if Java were to go Communist a free Indonesia would be
                            established in the outer-islands. The Ambassador suggested that Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_Simbolon1">Simbolon</persName> was the
                            strongest of the dissidents but that he had no troops.</p>
                        <p>As there seemed to be some confusion in Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName>’s mind, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> made clear that in asking
                            these various questions he was simply trying to ascertain the Dutch
                            views. He said that no one in Washington is arguing for support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and that there is
                            no possibility of this Government supporting him although there is a
                            strong feeling in Washington that we should support a moderate element
                            in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a further question the Ambassador said he knew of no figure
                            who might replace <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He
                            speculated that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> might
                            become Prime Minister but he doubted that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> would take any action against <persName

                            moderate opposition. The Ambassador then noted that the Sultan of
                            Djogakarta was a very hard headed, ambitious man but his authority was
                            limited to Java. He recalled that the Sultan in the October 1952

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reiterated that we
                            believe there are many moderates in Indonesia opposed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and he pointed out that a
                            group might arise in Indonesia to which support might have to be given
                            quickly. The Ambassador reiterated his belief that anything done now
                            will only help <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>, he said, is a
                            moderate and non-Communist who is dragged along by <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The President has had his
                            ups and downs with the people but he still has the ability to sway the
                            masses. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> noted that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> while in
                            the United States said he had seen little here that was comparable to
                            the problems he faces in Indonesia but that in China he had clearly been
                            affected by Mao Tse-tung’s ability to run the masses who suffered the
                            same illiteracy and poverty that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> has seen in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> then said
                            that several governments have offered to mediate between the Dutch and
                            Indonesians and have been given a categoric “No” by The Hague. He said
                            that on New Guinea the Dutch are not going to negotiate although they
                            remain willing to submit the matter to the International Court of
                            Justice. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said this
                            made a perfect impasse because the Indonesians wanted to discuss New
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                            >Subandrio</persName>, the Foreign Minister, is still thinking in terms
                            of Dutch refugees from Indonesia putting pressure on the Dutch
                            Government to negotiate. He said that their information indicated also
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> believes the West
                            will not allow the situation to drag on and that eventually the West
                            will take a move to straighten out the situation as it did with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The Ambassador
                            emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> is
                            miscalculating completely and said that the view of his Government is,
                            if Java falls to the Communists, the outer-islands would rally and form
                            a free Indonesia with new leader emerging.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador left for informational purposes only an exchange of notes
                            between the Dutch and the Indonesians on recent Indonesian actions (see
                                attachments).<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">These notes, December 10 and
                                27, are not printed.</note> He said under normal circumstances the
                            Dutch would have refused to accept the Indonesian note. However, because
                            the Dutch do not wish to give the Indonesians any excuses to break
                            diplomatic relations they have not done this.</p>
                        <p>Just before the Ambassador left there was some discussion of the
                            Indonesian law which purported to draft foreigners for the use of the
                            State. The Ambassador apparently was not aware of the most recent law,
                            news of which came in a few days ago. He said, However, that to his
                            knowledge which might not be complete no Dutch nationals had been
                            drafted under the previous law of six months ago.</p>

                                    There were conflicting reports on this point.</p>
                                <p>“Meanwhile, further measures against the Dutch were being planned
                                    by the Indonesians. It now appears that they are going to try to
                                    repudiate all their financial obligations to the Dutch. Such a
                                    repudiation would have the most serious repercussions. The
                                    deteriorating economic situation in Java has led to further

                                <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss> for information. At close of
                            general conversation this morning on internal situation <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> said he would like to speak to
                            me not as Prime Minister to Ambassador but as friend-to-friend. He then
                            told me that Russians had been recently putting extreme pressure on
                            Indonesians to accept ships and military equipment for use in present
                            emergency. <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> says that for
                            this purpose Soviet Ambassador Zhoukov apparently returned to Djakarta
                            earlier than had been anticipated. (In this connection press reports
                            that Zhoukov had “courtesy” interview with <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> yesterday morning.) <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> said that Russians were offering equipment on
                            understanding that conditions of payment could be settled later after
                            arrival of equipment.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister expressed gratitude that arrangement for ships from Japan
                            had been completed prior to Russian offer so that there was no
                            compulsion on that part of Russian proposal. With respect to rest of
                            proposal, <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> said he was
                            hopeful it would be possible to stall until return of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> when there might be
                            different situation. He said that it was his intent only to go ahead
                            with already negotiated Soviet loan which he anticipates will come
                            before next Parliamentary session. This loan provides only for some
                            factories, some communication and transportation equipment and for no
                            military equipment other than jeeps. Previously <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had told me that one of reasons
                            he had been anxious for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> to visit Cairo was so that he could have good
                            talk with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and learn from
                            him some of problems connected with receiving Soviet equipment.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> believes, apparently
                            on basis of reports from Indonesian Embassy Cairo, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> has become somewhat
                            disillusioned with Russians and that his experience will give <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> food for thought. At no
                            time did <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> mention question
                            of whether or not America would provide Indonesia with military
                            equipment, and I believe he is honestly concerned at prospect he may be
                            forced into position of taking some such equipment from Soviets. He did
                            say that Indonesian Government was getting in recent weeks increasing
                            evidence that both arms and equipment were being airdropped in various
                            parts of Eastern Indonesia and that small Dutch Naval vessels had been
                            calling at isolated points in Eastern Indonesia and were apparently
                            giving aid and comfort to local insurgents.</p>

                            satisfactory Indonesian government should come into being we should be
                            prepared to grant it military and economic aid. I further recommended
                            that immediate opening of negotiations with present government might
                            forestall purchases by it of military equipment from iron curtain
                            countries, but I said that deliveries could be delayed until we saw
                            results of present political activities in Indonesia. I also stated my
                            belief that any Indonesian government, which came into power, whether or
                            not dominated by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            would demand return of West Irian and that we would eventually have to
                            face that issue as part of over-all Dutch-Indonesian relationship.
                            However, I have never advocated immediate handing over of West Irian to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and my last

                            as I had previously made known to Department, I believed much of
                            Embassy-Department differences might be straightened out if I could be
                            recalled to Washington for consultation, and I expressed hope this could

                            be recalled that I specifically requested such recall last August but it
                            was not then permitted. I greatly regret that I was given no opportunity
                            to discuss this matter personally with the Department before final
                            action was taken.</p>
                        <p>With respect to first sentence Department’s 1881, I had thought my
                            message regarding New Year’s reception at Palace would show that
                            government leaders were no longer avoiding me but on contrary making
                            every effort, short of public denial of Blitz articles, to indicate
                            continuing confidence.</p>

                                    February rather than in the next three or four days. Mr.

                        <p>I agree that the U.S. should be prepared to extend quickly to Indonesia
                            military assistance should it be decided to do so, and that we should
                            continue contingency planning for such a course of action. I feel,
                            However, that it would be premature to seek a 401 (a) determination at
                            this time. Such action will, of course, be kept under continuing
                            consideration, and, should we decide to proceed with token aid, could be
                            undertaken if it appeared necessary in the light of the Indonesian
                            response to notification of U.S. preparedness to make arms available and
                            the internal political situation at that time. In any event, the
                            Department of State would wish to be certain that any arms made
                            available by the United States would not be used in support of
                            Indonesian claims to West New Guinea.</p>

                            to reduce Communist strength, will permit more autonomy to the outer
                            islands, and will give the latter a greater share of national revenues.
                            Because of their reluctance, they will probably be willing to negotiate
                            with the central government even though the negotiations are prolonged
                            far beyond the five day limit. However, if no progress is made in the
                            negotiations, if the central government should reject their demands out
                            of hand, or if the central government begins to receive large quantities
                            of Bloc arms, the chances are better than even that the Padang group
                            would break with Java and establish a “Provisional Government of
                            Indonesia.”</p>

                            government. They probably believe they have or can gain the support of
                            most of the military on Borneo and in the Moluccas, and the Darul Islam
                            groups on Java and those which control most of South Celebes.</p>
                        <p>b. The leaders of the <persName corresp="#p_NM2">Natsir</persName> wing
                            of the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> party and their

                            important as an indication of the seriousness of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM2">Natsir</persName> intentions. Thus, the Padang

                                >Natsir</persName> will have the active support or the <gloss

                            party which has its strength among the intellectuals and in the civil

                        <p>c. The Padang group probably estimates that the position of <persName

                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been weakened by the
                            troubles which have resulted from the anti-Dutch campaign. The dissident

                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> that some of

                            about the growth of Communist influence and are in agreement that there
                            should be a change of government. They probably also estimate that

                            committed to no change of government until <persName

                            obtain Western, particularly <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support.
                            Moreover, the group, in present circumstances, believes it could
                            successfully resist any military action by the forces loyal to the
                            central government, unless the latter should obtain a massive supply of
                            arms, including planes and warships, from the Bloc.</p>

                                    early February, demanding that the government resign within five
                                    days or proclaim a new Free Government of Indonesia, which would
                                    be an internal reform government stressing regional autonomy and
                                    anti-communism. The Djakarta government appeared unlikely to
                                    surrender, and would probably insist that all discussion of
                                    government reforms must await <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"

                                    its negotiations with the Soviet Bloc for arms shipments. For

                            Neither of these leaders wishes to push the situation to the breaking
                            point nor to bring about a civil war. However, their ability to maneuver
                            is restricted because both appear determined to honor their commitment
                            to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to maintain the
                            status quo until he returns. The central government, at least in the
                            short run, probably will not attempt to put pressure on the outer
                            islands by cutting off the pay of army units and subsidies to provincial
                            governments in the dissident provinces, by strengthening garrisons of
                            Javanese troops on Sumatra and the other outer islands, or by increasing
                            blockade operations to halt barter trade.</p>
                        <p>4. The Padang group would probably agree to the government’s offer to
                            negotiate and would not hold to the five day period given in the
                            ultimatum. It is difficult to say how long the Padang group would be
                            willing to talk and the extent to which their determination to act might
                            drain away.</p>
                        <p>5. The outcome of such negotiations is unclear. The Padang group’s
                            bargaining position would be strengthened by its growing military
                            capabilities and the possibility of outside support, both of which will
                            be evident to the central government. Pressure against the government by
                            anti-Communist elements on Java who sympathize with the Padang group’s
                            objectives will also be a factor. On the other hand, the central
                            government would have strong and vociferous support from the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and extreme nationalist elements in the
                            non-Communist parties on Java. It would continue to draw on <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s influence and prestige,
                            which, though reduced, would continue to be great, particularly among
                            the masses and certain elements of the armed forces. Its position would
                            be greatly strengthened if either <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> or the Sultan of Jogjakarta had refused to have
                            anything to do with the Padang group’s proposals. The central government
                            is aided also by the disinclination of the <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss> leaders to collaborate with the Padang group because of
                            the close association of their chief rival, the <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, with this group and because of
                            the demands of the group for considerable provincial autonomy.</p>
                        <p>6. The central government’s initial purpose in seeking to negotiate would
                            be to stall until <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            returns, or at least until it can obtain his views. For <persName

                            would be possible: he could agree to the formation a new government; he
                            could seek to prolong the talks while taking steps to weaken or to
                            destroy the Padang group; or he could close out the negotiation and
                            undertake forceful measures to defeat the Padang group. In the event
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> should prolong
                            his stay abroad and the Padang group became restive, <persName

                        <p>7. We believe that the chances are better than even that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will accede to the
                            appointment of a new government, especially if it can be done in a
                            manner which “saves his face.” However, it would probably not meet fully
                            any of the major points contained in the Padang group’s ultimatum. It
                            would probably be made up of non-Communist political leaders and might
                            include <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>, but it would
                            probably not be a government committed to rigorous action against the
                            Communists. At best, it might agree to the removal of a few known
                            Communists from key positions. Such a fuzzy outcome, while not
                            satisfactory, would probably be accepted by the Padang group, at least
                            for a trial period. The provincial leaders would probably attempt to
                            maintain their cohesion during such a trial period in order to negotiate
                            with the new government for their other objectives, and, if necessary,
                            to issue a new and stiffer ultimatum.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prolongation of Negotiations</hi></p>
                        <p>8. If the central government adopted this tactic, the Padang group would
                            be in a dilemma. If they broke off the talks, they would bear the onus
                            and probably lose support on Java. Such action might also tend to bring
                            the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> together. On the other hand, if the talks continued the
                            central government would be gaining time in which to seek the defection
                            of various elements among the outer islanders and to build up its own
                            armed strength.</p>
                        <p>9. The chances are probably somewhat better than even that in this
                            situation the Padang group would hold together and would eventually send
                            another ultimatum. Evidence of an extensive build up of the capabilities
                            of the armed forces on Java would probably speed up such a decision by
                            the Padang group. If the government in reply gave little or no
                            satisfaction, this might become the point at which the outer islands
                            break with Java.</p>

                        <p>10. If, upon <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s return,
                            the central government should adopt a firm line and break off
                            negotiations, the chances are about even that the Padang group would in
                            reaction set itself up as the “Provisional Government of Indonesia”, cut
                            off all revenues to the central government, seek to initiate covert
                            operations on Java to bring down the government, and appeal for
                            international recognition and more arms. In turn, the central government
                            would adopt similar courses of action and would stop the flow of
                            revenues to the rebel areas, would seek to establish a blockade of these
                            areas, and would also appeal for international support and assistance.
                            It would probably denounce the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as the
                            cause of the situation. Although both sides would be reluctant to
                            initiate <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0049"/>serious military action,
                            the chances of a full blown civil war developing would be greatly
                            increased.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">A Civil War Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>11. If a full break should occur between Java and the outer islands, and
                            if hostilities should begin before the Djakarta government had obtained
                            substantial supplies of military equipment, the Padang group would have
                            a better position in the outer islands than would the central
                            government. It could probably count on the loyalty of the people and of
                            the forces directly under its command on Sumatra and northern Celebes.
                            It would probably also have the support of the Atjehnese in northern
                            Sumatra, the Darul Islam forces in South Celebes, the Amboinese and
                            groups in the other Moluccas which support the East Indonesian Republic
                            movement, and some elements on Borneo. We are unable to estimate the
                            outcome of an effort by the Padang group to defeat the central
                            government on Java. It would depend in large measure on the loyalty of
                            Javanese army units to the central government, the capabilities of the
                            Communists, the possible reaction within the army should the Communists
                            seize or be given the role of leadership of the government, and on the
                            military capabilities of the forces loyal to the Padang group. At a
                            minimum, the Padang group could probably launch fairly widespread
                            guerrilla warfare on Java. While it probably would not be able to land
                            significant forces from the outer islands, it could count on the Darul
                            Islam, the Moslem Youth Group (GPII), possibly some units from the
                            Silawangi Division in West Java, and some volunteers from the <gloss

                                >NU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Reactions of Non-Communist Countries</hi></p>
                        <p>12. The presentation of the Padang group’s ultimatum and the
                            negotiations, which we think likely to follow, will probably elicit
                            little response either from the Afro-Asian countries or other
                            non-Communist countries. However, if the Djakarta government publicly
                            charged the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as acting in support of
                            the outer islanders, the Afro-Asian press would almost certainly echo
                            such charges.</p>
                        <p>13. If the Padang group declared a “Provisional Government of Indonesia”,
                            most non-Communist governments would seek to remain neutral and some of
                            the Afro-Asian governments would probably offer their good offices in
                            hopes of averting a civil war. Most of these countries would be
                            concerned that unless the situation was resolved fairly quickly, the
                            Soviet Bloc would intervene to the greatest extent possible on the side
                            of the central government, thus raising the possibility of a civil war
                            of the Spanish variety, which potentially could blow up into a major
                            war. At the same time, the neutral Moslem countries would also have
                            sympathy for the Moslem leaders of the Padang group. Support for the
                            Padang group would probably increase considerably, even <pb n="24"
                                xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>among the Afro-Asian neutrals, if the
                            Communists should attempt to seize control of the government on
                            Java.</p>
                        <p>14. If civil war actually broke out, most Afro-Asian countries would
                            continue to remain neutral and would not extend recognition to the
                            Padang group. A major factor determining their attitude would be whether
                            or not the Communists had seized power on Java; if this happened,
                            probably Malaya, Thailand, South Vietnam, the Philippines, Nationalist
                            China, South Korea, and possibly Japan would recognize and at least
                            extend diplomatic support to the Padang group. The general trend on the
                            part of most Afro-Asian countries would be to seek to close out the
                            hostilities as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Reactions of the Sino-Soviet Bloc</hi></p>
                        <p>15. The Bloc has already made generous offers of assistance to the
                            central government and the presentation of the Padang group’s ultimatum
                            would have relatively little immediate effect on Bloc actions. If the
                            Bloc leaders came to estimate that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            was involved in some manner, the Communist press would scream about
                                “<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> imperialism”, and would press its
                            arms and technicians on the central government with increased urgency.
                            It is possible that the Soviet Union would raise this issue in the
                            United Nations. There would be little change in the character of the
                            Bloc campaign against the West and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            if the Padang group broke with Java but the intensity might increase.
                            The Bloc leaders might at this point order the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> to launch a major effort to seize control of the
                            Indonesian government.</p>
                        <p>16. If civil war should begin, the Sino-Soviet Bloc would continue to
                            offer diplomatic and material assistance to the Indonesian government.
                            If the Communists had come to power on Java, the Sino-Soviet Bloc might
                            talk in terms of sending volunteers. However, we believe that the
                            Sino-Soviet Bloc would not attempt to intervene with its own forces or
                            major numbers of volunteers, even to save a Communist government. The
                            chances would be much greater that the Soviet Union would raise the
                            issue in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="3"

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                            meetings revealed that the British objective was to obtain a firm
                            statement regarding United States policy toward Indonesia which they
                            apparently feared was directed at establishing a fragmented
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the first meeting we explained that we envisaged a
                            two-pronged operation in Indonesia: the first designed to attempt to
                            bring about a new government on Java by encouraging the non- and
                            anti-Communist elements there to cooperate with each other in the face

                            time both to reinforce non- and anti-Communist elements on Java and to

                        <p>The rest of the meetings have been devoted to an examination of the
                            considerations involved in supplying the Indonesian Government with rice
                            and arms; what, if anything, could or should be done about West New
                            Guinea; by whom and under what circumstances should the gap left by the
                            Dutch be filled, particularly with regard to shipping; and finally, what
                            would be the best manner in which to proceed to delay delivery of the
                            four warships the Indonesian Navy now has on order in Italy. The
                            consensus of the group, which reflected the views of London and
                            Canberra, was that the risks involved in trying to prevent the imminent
                            delivery of two frigates was not worth the advantages to be gained, <pb
                                n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0052"/>as the frigates will not provide
                            the decisive military advantage to the Central Government. The question
                            of whether to attempt to delay the delivery of the two corvettes (now
                            scheduled for May) is under urgent study.</p>
                        <p>In addition, agreement has been reached regarding a joint estimate of
                            developments in Indonesia since August 1957. A copy of this is attached.

                        <p>Further meetings will be held, but I think it best to keep these on an ad
                            hoc basis to face specific problems as they may arise, a position which
                            at this point would appear to satisfy the British but may not be too
                            palatable to the Australians. Should we try to terminate the working
                            group, However, it is not impossible that the Australian reaction will
                            be to send Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> to this
                            country or even to call a special <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"
                                >ANZUS</gloss> meeting. Neither of these developments at this
                            juncture would seem to me to be helpful.</p>

                        <p>On February 6 at the 354th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> discussed
                            Indonesian developments during his intelligence briefing: <quote

                                <p>“Turning to the situation in Indonesia, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> said that if there was to be a
                                    climax in Indonesia, we were on the point of reaching it; but
                                    one has to be very skeptical about the Indonesians and about any
                                    climax. As a people, the Indonesians often do a lot of talking,
                                    accompanied by very little action; but it seems that the
                                    dissidents will join in submitting an ultimatum to the Djakarta
                                    government on the 7th of February. In brief, the ultimatum will
                                    say ’clean up or clear out’. Meanwhile, an envoy of the
                                    dissidents has been in contact with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Tokyo. Reports
                                    of this meeting seemed to be in character with what we know
                                    about <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. He is
                                    alleged to have wept; but after the envoy had departed,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had sent
                                    instructions to Djakarta to make no change in policy.
                                    Accordingly, his tears may have been of the crocodile variety.

                                <p>“Meanwhile, there have been some negotiations between the Central
                                    Government and the dissidents on Sumatra. The latter have now in
                                    readiness a complete new Cabinet for Indonesia. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> thought it likely that the
                                    ultimatum would be presented by the dissidents, and that the
                                    government would then suggest further negotiations. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would then return,
                                    after which anything could happen—possibly a blow-up. The great
                                    problem is where the Army stands, particularly the forces in
                                    Java. These forces seem divided in their loyalty between the
                                    dissidents and the Central Government. The military capabilities
                                    of the dissidents have recently improved, although they profess
                                    to fear greatly an air attack from Java.</p>
                                <p>“The Sultan of Djogjakarta has arrived in Washington, allegedly
                                    to take part in a conference on tourism. This was very queer
                                    conduct for the Sultan, but a great many Indonesian
                                    fence-sitters are busy getting out of the way until the
                                    situation clarifies. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded
                                    by predicting the possibility that, whatever happened, the outer
                                    islands would split off from Java.” (Memorandum of discussion,

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> began the
                            conversation with the statement that Indonesian actions against Dutch
                            interests in Indonesia had created <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0054"
                            />an economic vacuum in that country. The Dutch Government was very
                            anxious that the vacuum not be filled by Communist bloc countries. The
                            Dutch Government felt that it was its duty to take the initiative with
                            friendly Governments to work out ways by which this could be avoided.
                            The Ambassador said he hoped the present conversation would be followed
                            by others in which there might be a full and frank exchange of views on
                            various aspects of developments in Indonesia. His Government considered
                            that such an exchange of views should concern not only developments in
                            Indonesia but also the policies which the two Governments intended to
                            follow in that area.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch Government took the position, he said, that should conditions
                            in Indonesia develop in a direction which might justify assistance from
                            Western countries, such assistance should be conditioned on the
                            willingness of the Indonesian Government to reach an agreement with the
                            Dutch Government concerning the confiscation of Dutch interests in
                            Indonesia and Indonesia’s failure to meet its financial obligations to
                            the Netherlands. As examples of what his Government had in mind, he
                            cited U.S. policy toward Iran in 1952 and the blocking of Egyptian
                            accounts after the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956. He asked
                            for U.S. cooperation with any Dutch efforts to obtain compensation for
                            damages which it had sustained in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then referred to the possibility that private firms might
                            wish to take over certain Dutch interests in Indonesia. In order that
                            these firms should avoid complications resulting from Dutch claims for
                            damages he said that the Dutch considered that the foreign firms should
                            work out with the Dutch firms a mutually agreed basis for any take-over
                            operation. The Ambassador then handed the Secretary an Aide-Mémoire,
                            copy attached, which covered the points he had made. He also gave the
                            Secretary a copy, in translation, of the Dutch note to the Indonesian
                            Government, dated December 30, 1957, protesting Indonesian actions
                            against Dutch interests. (Copy attached).<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1"
                                >Neither printed. See Supplement.</note></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador explained that a similar approach had already been made to
                            the British Foreign Minister who had received it sympathetically. He
                            added that approaches along the same line were being made in Brussels,
                            Paris and Bonn and that his Government also intended to talk to the
                            Japanese Government in this general sense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the Dutch Government was faced with many
                            problems arising out of developments in Indonesia and said that the
                            Department would be prepared to exchange views informally with the Dutch
                            Government on this general subject. He then added that he wished to
                            comment on one point which the Ambassador had made. <pb n="29"
                                xml:id="pg_29" facs="0055"/>He said that U.S. action in blocking
                            Egyptian assets in 1956 had not been undertaken as a form of reprisal.
                            He explained that this action had been designed to protect our shipping
                            companies from double jeopardy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that there seems to him to be at least a
                            superficial inconsistency between the Dutch position that non-Communist
                            countries and enterprises from these countries should fill the vacuum in
                            Indonesia and the statement putting everyone on notice that unless
                            acceptable compensation arrangements were worked out with the Dutch
                            there would be interminable legal complications. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> said that in his opinion the
                            apparent inconsistency could be removed if the problem was considered in
                            terms of the situation which the United States faced in Iran in 1952.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> added that his
                            Government did not wish to appear unreasonable. The Dutch did not expect
                            to be compensated for the entirety of the losses they had suffered in
                            Indonesia. As another example of the fact that the Dutch were taking a
                            reasonable attitude, he mentioned their position on the furnishing of
                            arms and equipment to Indonesia. He said that the European Allies of the
                            Dutch had been informed that the Dutch Government was not opposed to the
                            shipment of all military equipment to Indonesia but that it did not wish
                            to see military equipment supplied Indonesia which could be used against
                            West New Guinea. The Secretary asked what was the Dutch attitude toward
                            the providing of military equipment which might be used against Sumatra.
                            The Ambassador replied that he believed that his Government would also
                            oppose the shipment of such equipment to Indonesia at the present time,
                            adding, However, that his Government would wish in this connection to
                            avoid giving the appearance of interfering in internal Indonesian
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">van

                            least the principle of adequate compensation. The Secretary commented
                            that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> appeared to him to
                            have lost some of his sound Moslem virtues and suggested that his trip
                            to China might have contributed to his present attitude. <persName

                            Indonesian problems and developments. The Secretary again acquiesced,
                            commenting that, as he understood it, the Dutch Government had in mind
                            an informal exchange of views. He pointed out the Indonesian actions
                            against Dutch interests were setting an unfortunate precedent and
                            referred to the position which the Afro-Asian Conference in Cairo had
                            taken towards private investment.</p>

                                    policy and concepts for its implementation must be directed

                                            to influence Indonesian affairs is the heritage of
                                            anti-colonialism and continued Indonesian suspicion of
                                            Western motives. The Indonesians are quick to resent any
                                            real or fancied attempts to influence their internal
                                            affairs and can be expected to react sharply under all
                                            such circumstances. For this reason, covert activity
                                            must be extremely circumspect and by its nature must be

                                        <item>In time of crisis in Java, it is probable that
                                            Indonesian military forces particularly the Army, will
                                            be a decisive factor. Although it is known that the
                                            Communist apparatus has infiltrated the Indonesian Air
                                            Force and Army to a considerable degree, the latter
                                            continues to be the principal stabilizing force within
                                            the nation and the element which has the most promising
                                            capability of maintaining a national orientation
                                            favorable to the West. At this time, Indonesia, although
                                            preferring U.S. arms, is actively considering offers
                                            from Communist Bloc sources. Provision of a controlled
                                            military aid program to forestall direct Communist
                                            influence in military affairs is considered necessary as
                                            a calculated risk. A token military aid program for
                                            Indonesia should be initiated at an early date. No
                                            military aid should be provided which would enhance
                                            appreciably the mobility of central government forces
                                            with respect to the possible employment of Javanese
                                            troops in the outlying islands. Further study of the
                                            internal Indonesian situation governing the distribution
                                            of such arms, and observation of the results of token
                                            aid, would be the governing factors in a possible more
                                            extensive aid program. Such a military aid program is

                            government in Sumatra could lead to an attempt by the Central Government
                            to force a solution by arms.</p>

                            The Foreign Minister said he had conferred with the Prime Minister, and
                            if the <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> report was accurate, the
                            Indonesian Government would regard Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                            statement as unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of <pb
                                n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0063"/>this country. He referred to the
                            last two paragraphs of the <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> release and
                            observed that these were inconsistent with the unfavorable remarks about
                            Indonesia’s “guided democracy”.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then said that he also deplored the statement of Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> if it proved to be true because he
                            believed it would place Indonesia in the position of being a pawn in the
                            cold war between the East and the West. He said the Russians had some
                            time ago asked him if he would like to have them support publicly the
                            Indonesian position on the West Irian and other issues but that he had
                            requested the Russians not to give such public support. He did this
                            because he said he felt Russian public support would provoke a reaction
                            from the West and make Indonesia a battleground in the cold war.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister then said that he thought it would be in the best
                            interests of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to refrain from
                            statements such as those allegedly made by Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> because he was sure that in any
                            psychological contest in Indonesia the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            would be at great disadvantage and that the Communist position would be
                            regarded much more favorably by the general public. This, he said, was
                            because the Indonesian people equated the Dutch attitudes with Western
                            attitudes and were inclined to regard Communist support and sympathy
                            with satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Finally the Foreign Minister said that the Indonesian Government thought
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>’ statement was particularly unfortunate
                            since it came the morning after the ultimatum from <persName
                                corresp="#p_HALC1">Hussein</persName>. He said the Indonesian
                            Government had decided to dishonorably discharge from the Army <persName
                                corresp="#p_HALC1">Hussein</persName>, Lubis, Djambek and <persName
                                corresp="#p_Simbolon1">Simbolon</persName> for their
                            insubordination. He said the Indonesian Government did not object to
                            legitimate political opposition since this was truly democratic but it
                            would not tolerate military insubordination. He said if the government
                            did not act firmly now it would find itself faced with outrageous
                            demands by many other areas.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Foreign Minister said he would appreciate my conveying
                            these views to my government. I assured him I would do so.<note n="2"

                                    leader on the island of Sumatra, had broadcast a demand on
                                    February 10 that the <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                        >Djuanda</persName> Government resign within five days. The
                                    Government had rejected the demand and ordered the discharge of
                                    Colonel Husein and the other chief leaders of the dissidents.
                                    If, continued Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, the dissidents
                                    stick to their earlier demands, they should proceed to set up a
                                    rival government. However, they are showing reluctance to take
                                    this step, and conversations between them and the Central
                                    Government are more likely. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                                    that it was extremely hard to predict the outcome of the crisis
                                    in Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                    was expected to return to Java in a few days, and it is thought
                                    that he will try to pull his forces together. <persName

                                    in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s absence.
                                    He is proving unwilling to head the dissident movement or to
                                    take over the government. This is the existing situation. We may
                                    expect a renewed crisis in another ten days after the Central
                                    Government makes its decision.” (Memorandum of discussion by

                        <p>The Minister stated that he was calling under instructions to inform us
                            that his government is instructing its representative on the North
                            Atlantic <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0067"/>Council to request all
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members to agree that no arms
                            shipments will be made to Indonesia and to request the support of the
                            United States representative when the matter is raised. The Minister
                            referred to previous discussions by the North Atlantic Council of the
                            Dutch Government’s request for bilateral consultations prior to any
                            shipments being made by any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> member
                            to Indonesia. He said that the earlier request had been based on Dutch
                            apprehension that such arms might be used by Indonesia against West New
                            Guinea, whereas the present approach was based primarily on the current
                            situation in Indonesia and the fear that any arms shipped to Indonesia
                            might be used by the Central Government against the dissidents. He
                            explained that his government was not seeking an agreed policy but only
                            a statement by each member that it would on its own undertake not to
                            ship arms to Indonesia. He said that a similar approach is being made to
                            the British and to other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> informed the
                            Minister that we had recently authorized our representative to the North
                            Atlantic Council to make a statement concerning the Indonesian request
                            for the purchase of arms from the U.S., which he summarized, and that
                            such a statement had been made. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> added that we have been dragging our feet on
                            the Indonesian request and that we have no intention of supplying the
                            government with any arms which might be used to eliminate the moderate
                            and anti-Communist elements in Indonesia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that the policy of the
                            United States Government is therefore that which the Netherlands is now
                            proposing, if he understood the Minister correctly, and that we have no
                            intention of doing otherwise. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> expressed the opinion that a discussion of
                            this subject in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might be
                            inadvisable since should it become known it might jeopardize the chances
                            of those forces in Indonesia which are trying to change the situation.
                            He said that we are hopeful that a moderate government will be set up in
                            Indonesia and we must be very careful, as Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">van Roijen</persName> had recently agreed with
                            him, that by our actions we not destroy that which we wish to see come
                            about. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        <p>The Minister mentioned two frigates and two corvettes now being built in
                            Italy for the Indonesians as an illustration of the type of equipment
                            which might be affected by such a policy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that we had been
                            given to understand that the Dutch Government had within the last few
                            weeks informed the Italian Government that it had no objections to the
                            delivery of these ships to Indonesia. The Minister stated that this
                            position had been taken when the order had first been placed with the
                            Italian Government but it was his impression that recently the Dutch
                            Government had made a new approach to the Italian Government. He said
                            that if a common line, such as the Netherlands <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42"
                                facs="0068"/>Government was proposing, were adopted it would be
                            easier for Italy, for instance, to say no to the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KD5">Ketel</persName> telephoned Mr. <persName

                            him that the Dutch Government had made an approach to the Italian
                            Government concerning these ships during the latter part of January. In
                            this telephone conversation he also informed Mr. <persName

                            new order with the Italian Government and that the Dutch have informed
                            the Italians that they do not agree with the Italian Government filling

                        <p>2689. In accordance Department’s instructions, I called on Foreign
                            Minister Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> at 11:30
                            a.m. on February 21 and expressed substance Department telegram
                                2246.<note n="1" xml:id="d21fn1"><ref target="#d19">Document
                                    19</ref>.</note> The Foreign Minister replied that he understood
                            the United States position and accepted it. He said he appreciated
                            United States reciprocation of his remarks concerning the friendship and
                            confidence existing between the two governments and he was certain that
                            his government appreciated all of the help and support which the United
                            States had provided to Indo in the past.</p>
                        <p>However, he regretted that the United States apparently did not recognize
                            the present problem as being one of internal security in which it could
                            assist.</p>
                        <p>He said that everyone should understand that young countries normally
                            pass through very troublesome early years and Indo is no exception. He
                            said the United States successfully met a challenge to its authority
                            during our Civil War and he believed that Indo was now in similar
                            situation. He said the central government had never objected to
                            political opposition but even understood and sympathized with the
                            demands of the regions for a larger share of the national wealth.
                            However, the present effort of the dissident government is led by older
                            military commanders who think 90 percent in political terms and only 10
                            percent in military terms. He said they were selfish, mercenary
                            individuals who are using their military positions for illegitimate ends
                            and they must be crushed by the central government. Otherwise the
                            country will be torn apart by other separatist movements led by
                            unprincipled military men. He said the problem, therefore, should be
                            divided into the military portion on the one hand and the
                            political-economic portion on the other. He said President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had decided to attack the
                            military problem first and to use every effective means to destroy the
                            rebel military opposition. After that, the President will address
                            himself to the political and economic problems. He said Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> had agreed with the President on
                            this analysis of the problem and had declined to enter the government
                            until the military portion had been solved. I then asked how much time
                            he expected this would require. He said they all understood that it will
                            not be easy, and that the military solution may not be forthcoming soon,
                            but However long it takes it must be the first step. I asked him if he
                            anticipated immediate use of military force against the dissidents and
                            he said the timing would of course depend upon military plans.</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0070"/>
                        <p>He then said he would like to have me know that his government did not
                            appreciate the intervention of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            in the present situation. I expressed surprise and asked him if he were
                            sure of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> intervention and he
                            said, “We have proofs of this.” I then asked him what form this
                            intervention took and he said, “Moral help and encouragement at least.”
                            He said that agents of the Sumatra colonels had been in touch with
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> representatives. I again
                            expressed surprise and asked him if he believed that this encouragement
                            came from official <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> sources or
                            from individual <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members. He
                            said, “Oh, I do not mean that there have been any public pronouncements
                            by <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> as such.”</p>
                        <p>He then switched the conversation and said he regretted the United States
                            decision but his government would now proceed to secure arms in India
                            and elsewhere on an urgent basis. He said this will be done on strictly
                            commercial terms with no strings attached. He concluded by saying he
                            appreciated my call and the Department’s frankness in setting forth the
                            United States position on this matter of arms.<note n="2"

                            A said you can tie the Communists into it a good deal but it is not an
                            actual takeover. They are pushing it more vigorously. The <gloss

                            are entitled to buy arms. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> thinks
                            so—we would be entitled to sell to them but also Djakarta could
                            blockade. AWD said it would help if we can get them in—[<hi

                            we have to consider. This is the best crowd we could get together. The

                            The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said he can call on his own—he
                            has received the tickers etc. AWD referred to the meeting at 10 and can
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> to be readier than 3
                            days. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said he does not visualize
                            what we will do. AWD mentioned sending something to get citizens out.
                            This is more urgent than what we did before. The presence of something
                            might be of moral value and a deterrent to the others because they would
                            not know what we are going to do.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> asked what we
                            would think about having a cruiser or a couple of destroyers around
                            Singapore. He said they would not stay in Singapore but would go in and
                            out of port. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> said
                            his people had been divided on this and that those who were opposed felt
                            that the presence of our ships could be misinterpreted publicly by both
                            sides, each claiming we were there in support of its position. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> and I agreed
                            that if necessary we could say our ships were there because of the
                            American citizens in the area and the need to be in a position to
                            evacuate them if it became necessary. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                                >Admiral Burke</persName> said he would order a cruiser down there
                            right away since the next few days will be the worst and then will
                            probably settle down to a slow simmer for several months.</p>

                                capable of being interpreted to justify almost any possible U.S.

                            Communist- anti-Communist split than we now face and had not expected,
                            short of a Communist effort to take over, that the lines of both sides
                            would harden to the extent that they have now apparently done. When Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJSJ1">Lay</persName> raised in the PB
                            discussion of the Special Report the question of whether the U.S. would
                            intervene in a civil war which did not involve a Communist takeover of
                            Java, Ambassador Cumming, according to my notes, stated that the U.S.
                            should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> intervene in such a situation.</p>
                        <p>The question of what we are prepared to do in the event of a request for
                            military intervention is not an academic question [<hi rend="italic">3
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. The worst thing that
                            could happen would be for the U.S. to become publicly committed to the
                            rebel side without being willing to follow through with direct military
                            help if it were to be requested. It is possible, I believe, to interpret
                            paras 1–b and 4 of the Special Report to justify overt provision of
                            military assistance to the rebels now on the grounds that there has been
                            a further “deterioration” of the situation on Java (para 1-b), though
                            not of precisely the sort we anticipated; and on the grounds that the
                            political situation is less “fluid" (para 4). However, I believe we are
                            approaching the margins of the situation that the policy was designed to
                            cover and that therefore some sort of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> review is justified.</p>

                                Dulles</persName>’ intelligence briefing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Turning to the situation in Indonesia, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that the United States
                                    faced very difficult problems in that area. He sketched the
                                    latest developments, most of which had been set forth in the
                                    newspapers. While there had been raids on Central Sumatra by
                                    Djakarta government forces, there had not as yet been an all-out
                                    attack on the Sumatra forces. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                    said that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was inclined to
                                    believe that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                    was not entirely sure of his army. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> estimated that perhaps half of
                                    the army forces deployed on Java would prove loyal to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. But even so, they
                                    were not very enthusiastic about an attack on Sumatra.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was to make a
                                    major speech on March 3, on which occasion he will presumably
                                    indicate his policy decisions with respect to the dissidents.
                                    This is likely to be a strong position against the rebel or
                                    patriot forces, either by the application of military force
                                    against them or by starving them out.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that the
                                    dissidents had moved rather too fast and made their decision and
                                    delivered their ultimatum without carefully counting their
                                    military assets. This did not mean, However, that they had lost
                                    the fight; indeed, they have a reasonable chance of winning it.
                                    The Sumatran soldiers were the best fighters in the Indonesian
                                    armed forces.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that the great problem
                                    confronting us is how far we go into the matter. [<hi
                                        rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                                    Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> predicated that if this
                                    dissident movement now went down the drain, he felt fairly
                                    certain that Indonesia would go over to the Communists. In this
                                    judgment Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> expressed
                                    agreement. Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> also pointed
                                    out that in past policy we have gone so far as to state that we
                                    could not afford to let this happen. We should therefore, in his
                                    opinion, be willing to take some very substantial risks in the
                                    situation.</p>
                                <p>“The President stated his belief that we would have to go in if a
                                    Communist take-over really threatened. Secretary
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> went on to point out that our
                                    chances for successful intervention were better today, with the
                                    assistance of an indigenous government on Sumatra, than they
                                    would be later on, when we might have to intervene without such
                                    a cover.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                            said three things worried him and the Cabinet in connection Sumatran
                            situation: <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, the Philippines and
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Concerning <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> repeated previous
                            allegation that his government has proof of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> interference. He said among other proofs he had a
                            photograph of a submarine surfaced off the Atjeh coast. He did not say
                            when this took place. I told him I was not speaking under instruction
                            but I knew that general purpose of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> was for defense and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"

                            non-member countries. Also <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> has
                            no military forces. Submarine if sighted would belong specific nation
                            not <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. I said I doubted anyone
                            could produce evidence that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> as
                            an organization had dealings with Central Sumatra. I said local press is
                            echoing Moscow charges against <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            but this of course is usual Communist slander. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> then said Russian Ambassador
                            had offered expose <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> activities
                            publicly but <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> told him
                            not to do so as this would merely intensify cold war with Indonesia in
                            middle. I remarked that Russia apparently had not heeded <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>’s request.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> then said that from
                            Indonesia’s experience during struggle against Dutch, he knew many
                            Filipinos would be willing supply men, arms and planes for a price and
                            he hoped Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> would use his influence
                            in Manila to discourage traffic with Sumatrans which might have serious
                            consequences for Indonesian-Philippine relations. I suggested he might
                            care to mention this to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> when he arrives next week.</p>
                        <p>Concerning United States he said we should not aid Sumatrans “because
                            Soviets have substantial interest here and they will not desert us.” I
                            made no reply so he continued talking. Said he had heard report which he
                            did not believe but would like my reaction. Said he was told there were
                            U.S. Marines in Philippines ready at moment’s notice to be dropped by
                            aircraft near oil installations Sumatra to protect American property and
                            people. I said I thought part of this report was probably true. He
                            looked very surprised and I added, “because U.S. Marines for over 150
                            years have prided themselves on readiness go anywhere do <pb n="51"
                                xml:id="pg_51" facs="0077"/>anything at moment’s notice.” We both
                            laughed. I then said this might be opportune time tell him if GOI Army
                            landed Bankalis or near Palembang he could expect me in his office
                            immediately to ask that he instruct GOI commanders give safe passage
                            tankers evacuating oil company dependents all nationalities. I said I
                            assumed he would have no difficulty granting such request. He replied,
                            “Of course I would agree. You could count on it”. I then said, “Well, in
                            that case no U.S. marines would ever be needed, would they?” We both
                            laughed and ended the conversation.</p>

                            rebels. Secretary General Suwito told <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3"
                                >Cottrell</persName> that Indonesia would warn the oil facilities’

                            U.S.-Indonesian relations for the worse. Suwito said he was sorry to

                            decision, but it was absolutely necessary and would be carried out

                            and therefore U.S. feels constrained lodge formal protest (2)
                            Destruction of installations would receive considerable publicity in
                            U.S., would likely evoke critical U.S. public reaction, and would
                            certainly not help promote good Indo-U.S. relations; and (3) If GOI
                            persisted in pursuing plan attack installations, U.S. would hold GOI
                            responsible for damage U.S. property and injury U.S. nationals and would
                            look to GOI for full compensation.</p>

                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had postponed
                                    setting forth his policy statement with respect to the
                                    rebellion, from March 3 to March 8. The intelligence community
                                    believed that he had done this in order to have his armed forces
                                    in place for a possible invasion of rebel territory immediately
                                    after he made his pronouncement. Meanwhile, <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been having
                                    conversations with <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>
                                    which do not seem to have come to anything, but it was possible
                                    that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would
                                    propose some kind of compromise with the dissident forces.</p>
                                <p>“Meanwhile, likewise, the military build-up on both sides has
                                    continued, and this build-up was described in some detail by Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName>, as was the possible shape of an
                                    attack by the forces of the Central Government against central
                                    Sumatra.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> interrupted to inquire as
                                    to the loyalty of the troops of the Djakarta government. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied
                                    that the <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0081"/>Djakarta regime
                                    had chosen carefully the troops it would use for the invasion,
                                    and that among them would be some very good fighters. On the
                                    other hand, he was not sure that either side had much appetite
                                    for fighting the other.</p>
                                <p>“The President observed that if the clash really occurred and the
                                    Sumatrans had a few good aircraft, they should be able to throw
                                    back the Djakarta invaders.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                                    continued by pointing out that the Djakarta government had
                                    informed our attaché of its proposal to bomb the oil
                                    installations of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss
                                        target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> oil companies in Sumatra. It now
                                    appears that they have probably been talked out of this
                                    proposal, though Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> rather wished
                                    they had gone through with it without telling our attaché in
                                    advance.</p>
                                <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired
                                    whether, if the Djakarta forces did bomb U.S. oil installations
                                    and kill U.S. personnel there, we could move in with U.S. armed
                                    forces. Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> thought this a
                                    possibility, and inquired of <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                                        >Admiral Burke</persName> what U.S. forces were available

                            that he was unable to give such assurances. He said the government has
                            given full consideration to this request and that he and the Prime
                            Minister had supported it. However, he said Foreign Office views on many
                            things do not prevail during this emergency. He said best he could do
                            would be to assure <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> that
                            if the installations were destroyed full compensation would be
                            provided.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> replied that he was very
                            sorry to hear this because the reaction to destruction under the present
                            circumstances would cause repercussions which were exactly those that he
                            was sure the Foreign Ministry would like to avoid. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> reiterated reasons why he
                            believed such an act would be disastrous to relations between two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> then referred to
                            Pakanbaru situation and asked if Foreign Minister would care to comment
                            on any government decision to take over the <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1"
                                >CALTEX</gloss> fields. The Foreign Minister said that the GOI must
                            take over <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> fields because they
                            could not permit the rebels to retain control. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> then reviewed the many reasons
                            why such an operation on the part of GOI would be counterproductive. The
                            Foreign Minister agreed to logic of every point raised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> except one. He said real
                            reason was psychological; that the government must do it to indicate
                            they could impose control wherever they wished in Indonesia. Unable to
                            dissuade the Foreign Minister from this position, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> said this left <gloss
                                target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> in a completely untenable
                            position since either GOI or rebels had power to cut down or destroy
                                <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> installations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> asked what Foreign Minister
                            thought they could do. Did he suggest <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1"
                                >CALTEX</gloss> shut down operations now and evacuate? The Foreign
                            Minister replied yes, since this appeared to be only course open. He
                            said if <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> shut down, it would
                            probably provide less reason for either side to destroy any
                            installations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> raised point of timing.
                            Could the Foreign Minister say when the GOI attack would be made because
                            no evacuation could be orderly in the midst of battle. The Foreign
                            Minister said this was military secret and he did not know. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> said he would immediately
                            confer with <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> and would request
                            an appointment later in the morning with Foreign Minister to discuss
                            evacuation plans if the company decided to undertake them. Report on

                                >Cottrell</persName> reported in telegram 2951 from Djakarta, March
                            7, that <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> met with him at
                            1:30 p.m. to tell him some “good news.” The Indonesian military had
                            called off the bombing raid against Padang, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> asked that the United States
                            make no public reference to the decision because of the military’s
                            sensitivity to foreign pressure. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3"
                                >Cottrell</persName> promised to inform the Department of this
                            consideration. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> also
                            promised a decision by the next day on the question an evacuation of the

                            Pakanbaru prior to an Indonesian attack. When <persName

                            Lincoln White’s statement, <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3"
                                >Cottrell</persName> showed him the text and the Indonesian Foreign
                            Minister was much relieved.</p>

                            emphasized by Arnold of <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss>. Every
                            effort was made to impress Prime Minister with serious repercussions
                            military action this area as well as necessity for prior evacuation

                                Supplement.</note> was only feasible evacuation program under
                            circumstances obtaining.</p>
                        <p>I was accompanied by Arnold of <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CSJ3">Cottrell</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> was also present.
                            Upon arrival Prime Minister greeted me cordially as an old friend and
                            both he and Foreign Minister waved aside questions of protocol under
                            current urgent circumstances. Prime Minister ushered group into living
                            room and then took me aside in small sitting room for private talk.
                            After exchange of appropriate courtesies he inquired as to whether I was
                            familiar with the plan for evacuation and whether this plan was
                            satisfactory to us. I pointed out that primary responsibility for this
                            decision rested with <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> but that
                            I had discussed plan thoroughly with Arnold and that we both considered
                            it unsatisfactory in that if there were to be military action in area,
                            dependents should be evacuated not merely held in camp at location which
                            might become involved in hostilities. More satisfactory plan in <gloss
                                target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> view with which I concurred was
                            orderly evacuation of dependents by tankers down Siak River.</p>
                        <p>I underlined serious risks involved to dependents and consequently to
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian relations in leaving
                            dependents in area which might become battleground. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> replied that he too would have
                            much preferred to have moved dependents out of the area but that timing
                            of military action was such that this was impossible. He pointed out
                            further that evacuation via Siak River tanker would (present)
                            opportunity for rebels either to (a) sink tanker and thus obstruct
                            passage on river or (b) follow along behind tankers and meet opposing
                            forces farther downstream.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>I then urged postponement or cancellation of proposed military action in
                            accordance with point (1) reference telegram.<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3"
                                >Point 1 of telegram 2501 reads: “Military economic psychological
                                reasons for singling out Pakanbaru for target first military action
                                against rebels remains unclear Washington.”</note> I said my
                            government found it very difficult to understand why Pakanbaru had been
                            singled out as target for first military action against rebels.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister then launched into long exposition of central government
                            philosophy in which he made points that (1) government’s authority must
                            be established on Sumatra; (2) solution must be reached which would
                            preserve <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> from
                            appearance of actual defeat yet reestablish authority and influence of
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> in an anti-Communist
                            government; (3) main reason for action thus was psychological though
                            obviously economic reasons played part; (4) no damage should occur in
                            Pakanbaru oil fields since they would not be military target and would
                            not be occupied; (5) he did not wish <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1"
                                >CALTEX</gloss> to close down and was confident that entire matter
                            would be resolved within a week or two.</p>
                        <p>There was no disposition on anybody’s part to put any of dissidents in
                            jail or even punish them, he said, except that dissident colonels would
                            not be permitted to rejoin army.</p>
                        <p>When I pressed further point as to how much time we had in which to
                            evacuate dependents under his plan or any other which <gloss
                                target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> was willing to accept, he shook
                            his head and replied, “Not much—you must start at once.”</p>
                        <p>We then adjourned to living room to join others where with permission of
                            Prime Minister I outlined briefly points he had made. Arnold said time
                            element was such it would be impossible to evacuate dependents in
                            tankers using river except to extent tankers were already up river at
                            Prawang. He also emphasized that unless tankers could continue to use
                            river, operations would have to be shut down. Questioned by Prime
                            Minister as to seriousness of a week or two shutdown, Arnold replied
                            that unless there were damage to installations, principal problem was
                            one of markets. With a surplus of crude currently on the market any
                            introduction of uncertainty in Indonesian supply would result in
                            purchasers seeking sources elsewhere and market would have to be rebuilt
                            from scratch. After further discussion, Arnold concluded that in view of
                            Prime Minister’s assurances and lacking any alternative, there was
                            nothing to do but accept situation and under protest implement GOI
                            evacuation plan. He informed Prime Minister he would get out
                            instructions immediately to this effect and order his tankers to proceed
                            down river to Pakning.</p>

                            critical days ahead. He covered briefly in turn principal elements in
                            current Indonesian situation: Growth of Communism, position of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, West New Guinea, and rebel
                            government, without However referring to Dutch.</p>
                        <p>Indonesia must work out her own solution to her own problems without
                            outside interference and his nation would not be cast in image of any
                            other nation, he said. America must also understand that Indonesia’s
                            foreign policy of active independence was just that. He referred to
                            Secretary’s and <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter
                            Robertson</persName>’s comments to him on subject of Communism on

                                    >Subandrio</persName> met in Washington on October 4, 1957; a

                            he did not need to be warned against Communism. “We recognize that if
                            Communists’ strength continues to grow here they will destroy us,” he
                            said earnestly. “No Indonesian wants to live under Communism.” He blamed
                            selfishness and corruption of many politicians of non-Communist parties
                            for increase in Communist strength, saying in critical period they had
                            been more interested in lining pockets than in developing strong
                            republic thus creating situation ripe for Communist exploitation.
                            Finally, political parties had awakened to situation and he indicated
                            united front was developing on this subject.</p>
                        <p>With amazing frankness he turned to subject of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, pointing out that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> press was characterizing him more and
                            more as Communist. “Let me be frank,” he said. “Whether we like it or
                            not, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is an element in
                            situation that must be reckoned with. He cannot be gotten rid of. But
                            Indonesia is bigger than <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>
                            and all the others.” He sketched portrait of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as a sensitive man, a
                            brilliant orator with strong hold on masses, but a man who loved
                            fleshpots. “Let him remain and have his pleasures,” he said. “He is no
                            Communist. He is first, last and always Indonesian Nationalist.” But he
                            indicated <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s reaction
                            to being called Communist was one of indignation at the name calling and
                            he said this plays into Communist hands. They are shrewd enough to
                            exploit this and other <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions in such
                            way as to drive <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            emotionally away from west.</p>
                        <p>Reading between these lines partly in light of what <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> told me subsequently, it seems
                            clear Foreign Minister was spelling out hoped for solution to present
                            impasse in which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            would retain titular title but would be less of power factor.</p>
                        <p>Turning to West New Guinea for moment, he related this issue primarily to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s emotional
                            reactions in such way that he seemed to <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                                facs="0088"/>be saying something might be done about this except for
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Or, he might
                            have been simply appealing delicately for further <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> consideration of Indonesia viewpoint. But I have never
                            noted delicacy in Indonesia approach this subject and inclined to view
                            this was effort give indication that door might be opened by Indonesian
                            Government if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could
                            be calmed down.</p>
                        <p>On rebels Foreign Minister was less tenuous and more forthright. He said
                            government had made up its mind its authority must be reestablished on
                            Sumatra and military force would be used to quell rebellion. He spoke in
                            uncomplimentary terms of rebel colonels calling them adventurers who
                            were feathering their own nests financially.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction with my response and then
                            observed significantly that it was a pleasure to talk with Americans
                            because one could speak frankly and discuss problems with viewpoint of
                            both sides being taken into consideration. He said he had found in his
                            experience as Ambassador to Soviet Union and subsequent relations here
                            that one could not do that with Soviets. “Soviets know what they want,
                            say what they want and that ends it,” he said. One cannot discuss
                            matters or have free exchange of views.</p>

                            intelligent, articulate man. While above may have been skillfully
                            designed purely for American consumption, he spoke with great
                            earnestness and fervor and seemed sincere. His references to <persName

                            indicating attitude of mind, even as between Cabinet members of this

                                March 12, the discussion in part was as follows: “Ambassador then

                        <p>During breakfast this morning with President Garcia and Secretary
                            Serrano, at which Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2"
                                >Bohlen</persName> accompanied the Secretary, there was a general
                            discussion on the Indonesian situation.</p>
                        <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0090"/>
                        <p>President Garcia and Secretary Serrano were very much concerned at the
                            developing situation in Indonesia and were inclined to be extremely
                            pessimistic as to the outcome. They appeared convinced from their
                            information that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            would succeed in crushing the rebellion by military force in a
                            relatively short period of time and that as a result: (1) he would feel
                            a deep debt of gratitude towards the Soviet Union and Communist China
                            for the international support they had given him; and (2) for the same
                            reason would feel very beholden to the Indonesian Communist Party for
                            its support; and (3) that having successfully quelled by force a
                            rebellion he would be disposed to use force against any form of
                            opposition in the future to his personal power and policies. President
                            Garcia on this point said that from his knowledge of Asian psychology he
                            believed that a military victory over the rebels would swing most of the
                            uncommitted masses of Indonesia to the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> bandwagon.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>,
                            while agreeing that this was a possibility not to be excluded, felt that
                            there were other factors in a confused situation which might work
                            against that result. For example, it was by no means clear that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would be able to
                            dispose of the rebels so easily, and an extended period of guerrilla
                            warfare might ensue. If this happened there was a distinct possibility
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would be
                            disposed to find some form of compromise which would in effect limit his
                            personal power and force him to eliminate the Communists from the
                            government. They pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName>, who had consistently and stubbornly refused to
                            cooperate with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> unless
                            he cleaned out the Communists from his administration, was a key factor
                            in the situation. The Secretary mentioned in the conversation that it
                            was clear that the rebels did not have much military equipment since
                            they were receiving no help from any government, but were forced to pick
                            up what they could from the commercial market. He also said that he
                            thought that the support of the rebels in the <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> Party was strong and that this
                            might be a factor to produce the compromise deal to which they had
                            referred.</p>
                        <p>It was apparent that President Garcia and Secretary Serrano were both
                            extremely concerned and worried about the possible outcome of the
                            Indonesian developments on the situation in the Philippines and the
                            entire area of Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>On March 13 at the 358th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> discussed
                            Indonesian developments during his intelligence briefing. The following
                            exchange took place: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Turning to Indonesia, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> stated
                                    that the <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                    government had moved with unexpected rapidity in its military
                                    operations against the rebels. He thereafter described current
                                    military operations. He pointed out that the dissidents had not
                                    planned their defense around the Pakanbaru area because of the
                                    threat to the civilian operatives in the oil installations, and
                                    furthermore, that neither side wished to be deprived of the
                                    revenues which flowed from the oil installations.</p>
                                <p>“Meanwhile, said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>, there had been
                                    apparently no progress toward a settlement of the civil strife
                                    in Indonesia. Not only was there no agreement between <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>; he had a recent report
                                    that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> had been put
                                    under house surveillance.</p>
                                <p>“There was no doubt that the military action of the Djakarta
                                    Government had been positive and vigorous. The position of the
                                    dissidents, while precarious, was not yet hopeless. The Djakarta
                                    Government’s control of the air above Sumatra might prove to be
                                    crucial. Moreover, the Air Force of the Djakarta Government was
                                    the branch of the armed forces most heavily infiltrated by the
                                    Communists.</p>
                                <p>“The Djakarta Government, said Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>,
                                    had recently issued a statement from the Indonesian Army which
                                    indicated awareness of weapons and ammunition drops, although
                                    the foreign country which was the source of these weapons had
                                    not been specified.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> repeated that the situation for
                                    the dissidents was critical. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                        >Sukarno</persName> succeeded in knocking them out quickly,
                                    it would be a feather in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                        >Sukarno</persName>’s cap and in that of the Communists.
                                    While <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself
                                    was almost certainly not a Communist, he was becoming more and
                                    more a prisoner of the Communist Party.</p>
                                <p>“The President inquired whether the United States would have a
                                    lawful right to intervene with force in Sumatra if the Djakarta
                                    forces seized the oil installations. Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> replied that if these
                                    installations were seized by the Djakarta Government with a
                                    promise of compensation, there would be no right under
                                    international law for U.S. intervention. On the other hand, if
                                    the lives of American citizens were threatened, we could
                                    lawfully intervene. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> commented
                                    that the lives of American citizens do not seem to be in any
                                    immediate danger in this area.” (Memorandum of discussion by

                        <p>The Department of Defense concurs in the following conclusions that have
                            been reached by the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding the strategic

                                <item>New Guinea lies astride the sea-lines of communication between
                                    the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Based on experience in World War
                                    II, only the north coast of New Guinea is considered militarily
                                    useful. For Australia, New Guinea represents a shield against
                                    invasion from Asia. Australia has always regarded the control of
                                    New Guinea by a friendly nation of paramount importance to
                                    Australia’s national security.</item>

                                <item>The strategic importance of Indonesia lies in (1) the impact
                                    upon the rest of Southeast Asia of eighty million Indonesians
                                    who recently won independence from colonial rule; (2) its
                                    strategic location astride the sea-lines of communication
                                    between the Indian and Pacific Oceans; and (3) its raw materials
                                    of rubber, tin, copper, and petroleum. Indonesia is a
                                    world-supplier of these materials.</item>

                                <item>In consideration of current U.S. military plans, there are no
                                    specific U.S. military requirements in Indonesia or West New
                                    Guinea. However, encroachments by the Sino-Soviet Bloc would
                                    disrupt the United States policy on Communist containment in the
                                    Far East, and would partially isolate Australia. Domination of
                                    this area by the Sino-Soviet Bloc would (1) deny to the United
                                    States and make available to China and the USSR certain rich
                                    national resources; (2) threaten the vital sea lanes through the
                                    Indonesian Archipelago; (3) jeopardize U.S. plans for the
                                    defense of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines; and (4)
                                    greatly weaken the determination of some Southeast Asian states
                                    to remain oriented primarily to the West.</item>

                            subject of foreign support for Sumatran rebels. At one point, discussing
                            military situation, he said that Sumatran forces were equipped with
                            three weapons to one man whereas central forces had one weapon for every
                            3 men. At another point he said that from beginning Indonesians had been
                            convinced of foreign participation because laying down of ultimatum
                            followed by proclamation was not Indonesian way of doing things.
                            Indonesians preferred to enter into long discussions and leave way open
                            for compromise. He added GOI had some evidence Taipei involved in

                        <p>Cabinet was quite distressed by Secretary’s remarks, Foreign Minister
                            said, and he undertook to explain them in such a way as to quiet
                            reaction. He had informed Cabinet, he said, that it was apparent
                            Secretary had been asked an unexpected question by press and that his
                            answer had no significance whatever in terms of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government having reached a decision to
                            recognize rebel regime on a de facto basis. He sought confirmation that
                            what he had said was satisfactory from standpoint of Embassy because he
                            would not wish to have to retract his remarks.</p>
                        <p>I confined myself to saying that Secretary’s comments were obviously
                            offhand, that it was natural that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Government would be studying the legal questions involved in a situation
                            of this kind and that he was certainly correct in his assumption that
                            the Secretary had no intention of indicating a decision had been made to
                            grant de facto recognition.</p>
                        <p>He then inquired as to what I understood de facto recognition to involve.
                            I replied that I, like the Secretary, would prefer to have this spelled
                            out by Department Legal Adviser but in general terms I was confident we
                            both knew that question involved actual control over specifically
                            defined territory by insurgents in any country and such questions as
                            payment of taxes and revenues to insurgents. As example, I pointed out
                            international law precedents held such payment to insurgents renders
                            unreasonable subsequent exaction of payment by titular government. Many
                            other problems, of course, arose in situation of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister expressed interest in summary of State Department
                            interpretation of international law in this respect and said he would
                            appreciate anything I could give him on generally accepted standards
                            with respect to de facto situation. I promised request such information
                            from Department and would appreciate brief summary by telegram followed

                            said most important thing to develop was mutual confidence between us
                            and our two countries and he hoped we should be able to accomplish much
                            in this direction over period of time. He reverted to question of West
                            New Guinea and pleaded for some “leniency” in our position on this
                            question. This was especially important, he said, because of its
                            emotional content within Indonesia and also because <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has fixation on subject and
                            laid greater emphasis on it than almost all other questions. He said
                            Dutch had misjudged Indonesian reaction and had showed little
                            imagination in their approach to this and other problems. Indonesians
                            actually like Dutch people, he said, and even now it was not too late to
                            restore Dutch-Indonesian economic relationship. He said he was not
                            asking me to comment at this time but hoped that in my conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> I might be able
                            to handle this question in such a way as to give <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at least some hope that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might be able to do something in
                            present impasse.</p>
                        <p>He then turned to subject of communism, referred again to his
                            conversation with Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> which apparently
                            made a great impression on him, and reiterated strongly what he had said
                            earlier to effect that he and others in government were alert to
                            communist threat in Indonesia. Leaders of present government as well as
                            political party leaders in Indonesia viewed with trepidation approaching
                            elections toward end of 1959 because of growing communist strength
                            indicated in local elections. There was no doubt, he said, that in
                            Indonesia Communists did not have “balance of power” but they did have
                            what he termed “balance of solidarity”. <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> was a vigorous, well financed, shrewdly directed,
                            hard-hitting organization and that so far none of the non-communists <pb
                                n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0100"/>political parties separately
                            could boast of such effective organization.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister reverted to question of mutual understanding between our
                            two countries which he had very much on his mind. He pleaded for
                            appreciation on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> side that Indonesian
                            way might be different from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> way but
                            our objectives were same in respect to their desire to establish and
                            maintain free and independent republic in which communism represented no
                            threat. He indicated settlement between <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was in making. He emphasized that this would not
                            mean that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> saw eye to eye on
                            situation, but in his view this might well prove to be virtue. If
                            successful compromise were reached, there would have to be some
                            face-saving on both sides, he said, touching then on sensitive subject
                            of guided democracy. Since this had never been defined, he indicated
                            that phrase might be preserved but interpretation altered. It would no
                            longer be democracy guided by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> but, recognizing that Indonesian people had much
                            to learn, it would be altered to educational concept in which all
                            Indonesian leadership would participate. This still is fuzzy but what he
                            was obviously trying to say was rose by any other name smells as sweet
                            and to convince me that in their own way Indonesians would tackle
                            problem of communism and come out on top.</p>
                        <p>As I was about to depart Foreign Minister again said earnestly, “Let us
                            work to achieve a meeting of the minds between us. We should be able to
                            understand each other. America was once a colony too.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had nothing new or

                            which may have significance.</p>
                        <p>President seemed his old enthusiastic, jubilant self, albeit he looked
                            older than when he visited <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, his face
                            more rugged and lined although not so haggard as in <hi rend="italic"

                            saying, “Indo is strategic in place and in time—politically, militarily
                            and economically”. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should recognize
                            importance of Indo. Relations between our two countries are not and have
                            not been what they should be, he said. There is a lack of understanding
                            between us that I regret. He cited failure of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> to support Indo on West New Guinea and general
                            impression that people in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had that he
                            was Communist and that present govt was Communist-inclined. He referred
                            specifically to Minister of Education Prijono and said he was no
                            Communist, that he received the Stalin Peace Prize because of his
                            educational work in the field of peace; Minister of Vet Affairs Saleh,
                            he said, was a left-wing nationalist but no Communist; Minister Hanifi
                            was only one in Cabinet who could really be called fellow traveler,
                            though not, he felt certain, a member of <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Another factor in this lack of understanding, he said, was Indo request
                            for arms to which there had been no response.</p>
                        <p>As for himself, he was no Communist. He stood firmly and Indo stood
                            firmly on the Pantjasila.<note n="5" xml:id="d43fn5">The Pantjasila, or
                                Five Principles, were first set forth by <persName

                                1945, and were endorsed in the Indonesian constitution of 1950 as
                                the basis for the Indonesian state.</note> (As defined in preamble
                            of constitution: (1) divine omnipotence, (2) humanity, (3) national
                            consciousness, (4) democracy and (5) social justice.) He said he was
                            referred to as “Creator of <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"
                            />Pantjasila”, that was an exaggeration—the Pantjasila “had been dug out
                            of the soil of Indo”. He, it was true, had been the instrument. He said
                            he recognized there were two political elements in Indo endeavoring to
                            destroy the Pantjasila: (1) Fanatical Moslems and (2) Communists.</p>
                        <p>There were three basic policies under which Indo was operating: these
                            were (1) Pantjasila, (2) neutralism as we called it or active
                            independence as he called it or policy of non-alignment as <persName

                            restoration of West Irian to Indon Republic. These three policies he
                            could assure us would “never, never change”.</p>
                        <p>Indo was endeavoring to stride across centuries in few years, he said,

                                made a 14-day tour of the country. Between late-August and
                                mid-October 1956, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                visited the People’s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and
                                several Eastern European countries.</note> He pointed out that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was so far advanced economically
                            and industrially that Indo had no hope of catching up, that Soviet
                            Russia too was in an advanced state of development industrially, but
                            that Commie China, which had been “a miserable country” only 8 years
                            ago, had made tremendous advance and that he had been greatly impressed
                            by what he had seen there. His conclusions, he emphasized, were also the
                            conclusions of <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and Minister
                            of Public Works Noor of the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>
                            Party, who had visited Commie China after his recent visit to <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>“When I say that methods adopted by Commie China in achieving this
                            development may hold lessons for Indo, I do not include their political
                            doctrine,” he said. “This I reject.” But rejecting of their political
                            philosophy did not mean he could not gain ideas on economic front.</p>
                        <p>“Americans do not seem to understand this” he complained. “I am called a
                            Communist by American press and even Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that Indonesia was drifting towards
                            Communism. I am not a Communist. Every word I said in America I still
                            stand by. I tried to point out that Nationalism was the fire that was
                            sweeping Asia and this is true. I am a Nationalist but no
                            Communist”.</p>
                        <p>At this point I interjected and made two points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>that Communist-China was country in which individual freedom
                                    had been lost—Merdeka had been destroyed—and where only 1-3/4
                                    percent of people were Communists, led by handful of leaders and
                                    this small handful was forcing its will upon the vast majority.
                                    I was confident that Indonesians did not want to follow this
                                    road.</item>

                                    did, but I said it is difficult for Americans to understand
                                    growth of Communism within your country and to understand why
                                    steps are not taken to reduce Communist influence.</item>

                        <p>President picked this up immediately and said that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> must share responsibility, that our position was major
                            factor in growth of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, Indonesian
                            people did not understand America’s failure to help Indonesia achieve
                            one of its basic national aspirations—that of regaining West
                            Irian—whereas Soviet Russia and other Communist countries supported
                            Indonesia on this issue right down the line. He then repeated what he
                            has said frequently in the past—if <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            would change its position on West Irian he could change this situation
                            in a moment, snapping his fingers to emphasize point.</p>
                        <p>“This is true and yet America stands mute!” he said. “Mute! and why? Why
                            can’t America change its position on this one issue?”</p>
                        <p>I observed I knew he understood our position quite well—that this was a
                            bilateral dispute between two of our friends, Indonesia and The
                            Netherlands, and that this was one issue on which we must assume a
                            position of neutrality. “This I do not understand,” he shouted “if you
                            changed your position little Holland would be annoyed—yes, but how do
                            you balance that against the annoyance of Indonesia?”</p>
                        <p>I admitted that Indonesia was a bigger country of greater resources but I
                            said there was a principle here that one did not desert one’s old
                            friends. I pointed out that our position had not won <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> popularity with the Dutch either.
                            However, President must understand our position clearly—cases of this
                            kind in which it is very difficult for a country to take sides in a
                            bilateral controversy occur not infrequently. I referred to Kashmir and
                            pointed out in this dispute Indonesia had, despite much pressure from
                            both India and Pakistan, refused to take sides.</p>
                        <p>President quickly changed subject and reverted to Communism within
                            Indonesia. Indonesian people are not Communists, he said. Even most of
                            those who vote <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> are not Communists.
                            They are left-wing nationalists. He cited case of what is called the
                            “Holy City,” that section of Surabaya in which is located the Sacred
                            Mosque of Ampel. “These people are 100 percent Moslem,” he said. “They
                            pray five times a day. But the Holy City voted 100 percent Communist!”
                            He also cited case of two leaders he knew in <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> who were strict Moslems. I observed that Islam and
                            Communism seemed to me as oil and water and I found it difficult to
                            understand basis on which <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> leaders
                            referred to could rationalize their position. In case of Surabaya
                            Moslem, I could understand because they had no idea as to meaning of
                            Communism. I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            orators in Surabaya carried copies of Koran with them and quoted it in
                            their speeches. This, I emphasized, came under heading of deception
                            rather than conviction.</p>
                        <p>I observed further that I was prepared to agree with him that most
                            Indonesians that voted <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> were not
                            Communists but Nationalists. This, However, did not reduce danger of
                            Communist takeover since party could equally well exploit vote for
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> whether cast by Commie or <pb
                                n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0104"/>non-Commie and I assured him
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government did not believe that
                            Indonesian people would ever willingly go down road to Communism.
                            Instead it was our fear that if Communists’ power within country was
                            permitted to grow, ultimately time would come when, even with minority,
                            Communists might stage coup and take over. This was not new to history
                            of Communist expansion.</p>
                        <p>I then cited Eastern Europe’s experience, using Czechoslovakia as prime
                            example. I pointed out that President Benes had felt it necessary in
                            reconstruction of Czechoslovakia after war to have represented in
                            government all elements of political community including Communists. In
                            period from 1945 to 1948, I emphasized, Communists posed as champions of
                            national freedom and independent foreign policy, took great care to
                            operate within framework of Czechoslovak national psychology and
                            appeared to make no moves which were not generally politically
                            acceptable, but when time came Communists believed they were strong
                            enough they moved quickly to take over. I was sure he knew that Jan
                            Masaryk was found dead in Foreign Office, generally believed to have
                            been assassinated by the Communists and that President Benes, broken
                            body and spirit, his influence gone, retired to country. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> nodded soberly at this
                            point and it was clear parallel was not lost upon him.</p>
                        <p>He then raised question as to why we were so worried about Indonesia’s
                            percentage of Communist votes. “You aren’t worried about France and
                            Italy yet theirs is higher.” I pointed out that at present time
                            Communist vote in France and Italy is decreasing as compared with
                            earlier years.</p>
                        <p>“We were worried about communism in these countries,” I said. “That is
                            what the <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall</persName> Plan was all
                            about: to enable these European countries to rehabilitate themselves
                            after the war, regain lost standards of living and give people hope once
                            more. We think it accomplished its purpose. But in Indonesia, the
                            strength of the Communists is increasing, not decreasing.”</p>
                        <p>President turned to his well-known concept of guided democracy and
                            referred to Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>’ remarks on this
                            subject, complaining that his idea had been generally misunderstood in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. “This is no Communist
                            conception”, he insisted. “This is my idea to correct a trouble from
                            which we suffer—over-democracy”. He claimed that there are 47 political
                            parties in Indonesia, each representing special points of view or
                            special interests. “This is nonsense”, he said, emphasizing that no
                            country can function with its people divided like this. No government
                            can act. His concept of guided democracy was one which would correct
                            some of these evils, reducing number of political parties. It was
                            designed to correct evils in body politic not destroy democracy.</p>

                        <p>Only time President showed violent emotional reaction during conversation
                            was when he referred to Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>’
                            observation on belligerent status of rebels.<note n="7" xml:id="d43fn7"

                            “This is way to Hell”, he said tensely, and repeated himself. Reaction
                            to such a move would be serious throughout Indonesia but would not be
                            confined to Indonesia, he said.</p>
                        <p>I took liberty of picking up Secretary’s cue in Dulte 11 from
                                Manila,<note n="8" xml:id="d43fn8"><ref target="#d38">Document

                            14, pointing out that early settlement of internal conflict would avoid
                            necessity for facing this issue. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> said nothing but looked thoughtful. I am
                            confident planting of this seed served good purpose.</p>
                        <p>I then queried as to whether President had anything he wished to say on
                            subject of possible settlement in current conflict, prefacing my
                            question by emphasizing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> desire to see
                            cessation civil war and our strong conviction dismemberment of Republic
                            of Indonesia against interest of entire free world. President reacted
                            strongly to this, “yes”, he said, “this would be against interest of
                            whole world”. He then said, “we will reach a settlement as soon as
                            rebellion is quelled”. He pointed out that Central Government was not
                            using great force or violence and did not wish to but that it must
                            reestablish its position and authority on Sumatra. He had tried to
                            settle controversy as soon as he returned from Japan but actions of
                            rebels in proclaiming revolutionary government had made this impossible.
                            He then said head of <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss><note n="9"

                        <p>I took advantage of appearance of President’s aide, indicating other
                            visitors were waiting, to say to President that I felt we had great many
                            things to discuss and I hoped this would be one of a series of
                            conversations. President seemed pleased and readily agreed, adding that
                            he had intended to suggest this had I not done so. I assured him that I
                            considered most important aspect of my mission establishment of close
                            understanding between our two countries, that I appreciated very much
                            his frankness and I felt that as between friends this was the way to

                            disagree.</p>
                        <p>President smiled and said he wanted to see me often. Would I prefer to
                            see him next in Bogor or Djakarta? I indicated this was a matter of his
                            convenience. He replied Bogor and he would tell me when. As I walked
                            out, he added, “keep close to me,” and repeated it for emphasis. <pb

                        <p>On March 20 at the 359th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> opened his
                            intelligence briefing with a discussion of developments in Indonesia:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence indicated that he would
                                    first go over briefly the strategic developments in Indonesia
                                    over the last week. These were hard to evaluate. Our
                                    intelligence sources describe the events as something like a
                                    chess game. It was in any event a strange kind of war. After Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> had
                                    dealt with the situation at Medan and at Pakanbaru, Secretary
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> inquired whether there was any
                                    solid evidence that fighting was continuing in the Medan area.
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied
                                    that there had apparently been little contact fighting on the
                                    ground, and that such losses as the dissidents had sustained had
                                    been occasioned by strafing from the air.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                                    indicated that there had been no change in the situation on the
                                    southwest coast, which was still held firmly by the dissidents,
                                    with no attempt yet at a landing by Djakarta forces. In South
                                    Sumatra, Colonel Barlian, the commander, was still proclaiming
                                    his neutrality. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt that he
                                    might have gone over to the rebels if they could have held Medan
                                    after they captured it. Turning to the Celebes, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> indicated that the northern
                                    areas were still strongly held by the dissidents under Lt. Col.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SLC1">Sumual</persName>.</p>
                                <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0107"/>
                                <p>“The President inquired whether any portion of Borneo had been
                                    affected by the civil war. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                    replied in the negative, and stated that the Djakarta forces
                                    still held Borneo, although they held it somewhat thinly. He
                                    then went on to point out that in recent days the dissident
                                    leaders had become very belligerent in their public statements,
                                    despite their difficult military situation. These statements did
                                    not, of course, help in realizing the possibility of a
                                    negotiated peace. Nor was there very much evidence of real
                                    fighting. Very poor communications facilities made it difficult
                                    for the dissidents to mount and sustain a concerted military
                                    operation.</p>
                                <p>“The President inquired about the character of the terrain in the
                                    area where the fighting was occurring, and asked Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> to provide a brief report on
                                    this subject at the next Council meeting. Apropos of the comment
                                    that the dissidents lacked the means of effective communication,
                                        [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                        declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied
                                    that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                        declassified</hi>] the great need of the dissidents was for
                                    aircraft, which they totally lacked. The President found it
                                    difficult to grasp what use aircraft would be in jungle
                                    fighting. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                                    aircraft could be used against the very few roads in Sumatra.
                                    The President replied that he would have imagined that the kind
                                    of roads to be found in the fighting area could readily be
                                    repaired after they had been bombed.</p>
                                <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded his comments on
                                    Indonesia by indicating that the Soviets have already delivered
                                    to Djakarta ten small merchant vessels. Moreover, Djakarta
                                    expects from Prague early in April IL–28 light bombers and
                                        <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MiG</gloss>–15 and –17 fighter
                                    aircraft. The crews to man these planes were already being
                                    trained in Egypt and Czechoslovakia. Receipt of these aircraft,
                                    together with trained crews, could produce a serious change in
                                    the military balance in the near future.” (Memorandum of

                                    compromise from being reached. He had informed them, he said,

                                    have been done because, he said, it was only with great
                                    reluctance that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                        >Sukarno</persName> had yielded to pressure to take military
                                    action. He said he himself was as much responsible as anyone for
                                    military action after ultimatum because he said he felt it was
                                    necessary to establish for all time in Indonesia that open
                                    rebellion was not way to accomplish objectives.</item>

                            disagreement on how to cope with Communist problem. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was deeply worried about
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>’s growing strength and believed
                            that Communist gains made entirely on basis promises which they not
                            required fulfill. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            therefore thinks Communists should be brought into government and be
                            forced accept responsibility for their promises. Their failure would
                            weaken them by showing them up. <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> said he entirely disagreed with <persName

                            pointed out to him that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> not

                        <p>Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> said he

                            to yield to him on this critical point and is prepared in principle to
                            give him power and responsibility for forming government. I asked

                                >Hatta</persName> stated that this was no mere legal quibble but
                            reached down to basic power factors in Indonesian politics. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> said he unwilling to form
                            government if he must clear important questions with political party
                            leaders in Parliament since parties in their present state development
                            tend to place patronage above other issues. Therefore unless <persName

                            opposed to “presidential” Cabinet envisaged by <persName

                            which <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> said are strong.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> seemed convinced that

                                >Sukarno</persName> based on exclusion of Communists from government
                            was possible, he said that military problem much more difficult to
                            solve. <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> said he does not
                            know how long military struggle will last but fears it will be
                            protracted. He believes that Padang group will put up a great resistance
                            on one hand, and army headquarters is adamant on necessity for
                            re-establishing what it considers primarily problem of military

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> said he thought <persName

                            until he and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> agree on
                            next Cabinet. In this connection <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> said that in his earlier talks with <persName

                            of agreeing on personalities for next government. Although <persName

                            what parties would be represented, he indicated that certain types of
                            politicians in present Cabinet would be excluded.</p>

                            was willing to have council in form of pre-Senate with, However, purely

                        <p>He said Indonesia would be faced with many problems when stable
                            government was finally established because printing press had been
                            running so freely. Also there was considerable hoarding of currency in
                            country due to lack of confidence in present situation and lack of goods
                            to buy. Under stable government this money would come out of hiding and
                            create additional inflationary pressures, he believed. He was currently
                            working on a plan to solve this problem, he said.</p>
                        <p>Second immediate problem would be that of rice. He emphasized that most
                            difficult aspect this problem was distribution rather than supply. Third
                            major problem area was economic development with a view ultimately to
                            raising standard of living. He said he had had many arguments with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on this subject,
                            having advocated that way to fight Communism was with positive program

                        <p>On March 27 at the 360th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> opened his
                            intelligence briefing with a discussion of developments in Indonesia:

                                    Director of Central Intelligence first presented a brief
                                    analysis of the topography of Sumatra. This was actually done by

                                    in the civil war in Indonesia. He provided estimates of the
                                    relative strength of the dissident forces and the Government
                                    forces, the former being well out-numbered. On the other hand,
                                    the Government forces are now moving into more difficult and
                                    mountainous terrain on the western side of the island. Their
                                    progress would be slowed up, and the major danger now facing the
                                    dissidents was an amphibious landing on the western coast of
                                    Sumatra, with the objective of capturing Padang. Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> summarized the situation or the
                                    dissidents as not very happy. On the other hand, they have not
                                    yet shown signs of giving up. The dissidents were holding their
                                    own in the Celebes, and were planning to attack the air-field at
                                    Morotai if they could find the planes and the pilots.”

                                Indonesia. The first purchase under this loan was 10 small merchant

                                by Communist China. Reports of air aid to Indonesia include the sale

                                “very near future” has also been reported. Naval assistance thus far
                                is limited to the probable ordering of several small ships from

                                and that in this process the indigenous Communists will gain a

                                probably is to ensure Communist control of Java, and then to extend
                                this control. In any event, the ultimate Soviet objective seems
                                clear: by controlling Indonesia it hopes to gain control of the
                                vital sea lanes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans together with
                                access to the country’s rich natural resources and its maritime
                                facilities, thus facilitating the projection of its sea power into

                            and army. <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> may ultimately

                            middle ground and who conceivably might rally enough support from
                            various non-Communist sources to accomplish something, seem unable to
                            employ their strength for decisive political action.</p>
                        <p>Where <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> stands at
                            present not clear. His position unquestionably bolstered by central

                                >Sukarno</persName> has left door open for compromise settlement and
                            most people who see him regularly claim that he is deeply worried about
                            difficulty rebuilding national unity. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s tolerance of communism now generally
                            recognized as one of main causes for insurrection and he is under
                            considerable psychological pressure to break with left wingers. As this
                            would represent almost 180 degree turn for <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> it probably unreasonable to
                            expect him make change himself. However most Indonesians agree <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> capable of turning against
                            Communists if necessary to preserve his own position. While still major
                            power factor, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may be
                            more passive than active at present stage because he is center of
                            pressures from Communists and anti-Communists.</p>
                        <p>As for Communists, while events of past few years seem to have moved
                            steadily in their favor, with non-Communists fighting each other and
                            with great expansion of economic relations with Soviet bloc,
                            nevertheless there are straws in the wind indicating that army is on
                            verge of adopting position hostile to Communist interests. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName>’s April 1 report to <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> central committee seems clearly aware
                            of this possibility. Much of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            growth in recent years might be swept a way if Indonesian political
                            system changed from parliamentary form to military dictatorship which
                            could dispense with elections and deal resolutely with economic
                            development. This is perhaps less likely than increased utilization
                            military within present framework in implementation government
                            decisions. Although <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> probably has
                            succeeded in building small armed force of its own and has infiltrated
                            to small extent regular army, it apparently has nothing like capability
                            for seizing power. Moreover, it is prevented from resorting to violent
                            tactics by fear of offering opportunity which anti-Communist army
                            officers have been vainly seeking for years to suppress <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> by force.</p>
                        <p>Rebels are losing ground fast militarily. Pakanbaru was serious blow and
                            expectations they would take advantage mountainous terrain resist
                            central forces advances across Sumatra have not been realized. It now
                            appears they may not defend Padang, and from reports of progress made by
                            GOI troops over land toward Bukittinggi, it begins to look as though
                            rebels will not even attempt defend that city (their capital). This
                            leaves guerrilla warfare as their only resort. <persName

                            of developing alternative government by military and economic pressure
                            on Djakarta seems almost to have faded out. Although main center rebel
                            military strength in Menado area has not yet been tackled, insurgent
                            movement has not proved successful enough to attract open support from
                            other dissident outer island areas and appears to have lost its
                            momentum.</p>
                        <p>Of four power factors army headquarters seems to have come out ahead. Its
                            successes in Sumatra have raised its prestige and it generally <pb

                            in economic and civil matters. Success of army is something of personal
                            triumph for <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> who
                            strongest and most consistent advocate of military action against
                            insurgents. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>’s current
                            measures aimed against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, which
                            Embassy has reported, which have been placed in motion at very moment of
                            central government successes in Sumatra, tend to bear out evaluation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> as basically
                            anti-Communist. As Department aware, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> is one of very few prominent Indonesians who in

                        <p>Consideration of above factors leads me to conclusion that army is
                            emerging as most reliable machinery available for anti-Communist action
                            at present and heightened prestige over Sumatran successes may be
                            expected increase its confidence in ability to handle Communist action
                            of any kind, whether violent or subversive. Latter, of course, is great
                            danger here and army has not yet demonstrated its capability this

                                    similar to the events in Panama which led to its recognition by
                                    Theodore Roosevelt. Unfortunately, the rebels so far had shown
                                    interest only in being the Government of Indonesia but if
                                    Sumatra were under anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"

                                    domination in the whole area. The Secretary observed that the
                                    original concept in the United Nations had been that Indonesia
                                    should be a loose confederation of the independent states.
                                    Perhaps this original idea could be explored.</item>

                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was doubtful. We would not
                            exclude the possibility of going to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and giving him the opportunity to change his
                            line but we must have the determination to act if he proved unwilling.
                            It was conceivable that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> might agree to set up a government with such

                            gotten rid of the rebels revert to the status quo ante. In any event we
                            did not think there was any possibility of a political solution unless
                            it was backed by the determination to do something.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Harold</persName> thought there were two
                            approaches: one was to help the opposition and the other was to try to
                            open up chinks on the government side. This was the rationale that had
                            led to Scott’s suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we believed we should do nothing overt unless it was
                            linked with political action and for the present time, therefore, we had
                            to limit ourselves to covert action. He did not want to give the
                            impression that we had decided on any of the three possibilities he had
                            outlined but we were studying them and he did want to talk with Sir
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Harold</persName> about them in a few
                            days. Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSHA1">Harold</persName> observed that
                            London was very doubtful that the plan for recognition of belligerent
                            rights would work. It might, However, logically follow after possibility
                            2 or 3 outlined by the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>On April 14, at the 362d meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> discussed
                            developments in Indonesia during his intelligence briefing. The

                                <p>“With respect to the situation in Indonesia, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> predicted that the amphibious
                                    attack by the Djakarta forces against the dissident stronghold
                                    of Padang might start at any time. He gave a summary of the
                                    details of the military plans for this amphibious attack.</p>
                                <p>“There had been no great change in the military situation since
                                    last week. The situation of the dissidents was extremely
                                    difficult, but if they were prepared to fight to the end, they
                                    still had some chance. The absence of all air cover was hard on
                                    the morale of the dissident forces. They do have anti-aircraft
                                    guns located around the Padang airfield.</p>
                                <p>“The President said it looked to him as though what the
                                    dissidents mostly needed was a submarine or two to deal with the

                        <p>During the past year, Major General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Abdul
                                Haris Nasution</persName>, the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian
                            Army, has emerged as a primary political as well as military force in
                            Indonesia. This rise to power has been due in part to the
                            ineffectiveness of civil leadership, in part to the military problems
                            arising from the regionalist rejection of the central Government
                            authority, and in part to the powers invested in the Chief of Staff
                            under the Indonesian Emergency Legislation. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> represents also Indonesia’s
                            most prominent political enigma. By his public activities he has
                            established a reputation for being a staunch anti-Communist and friend
                            of the West. At the same time, he has been a firm supporter of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the present
                            Government. He has insisted on crushing the strongly anti-Communist
                            rebel Government with military force and has shown no current
                            disposition to use his considerable authority to check the growth of
                            Communism on Java. Because of the position he now occupies and the
                            likelihood that he may in coming weeks accede to positions of even
                            greater authority, an investigation of the background, attitudes, and
                            activities of this man appears appropriate.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was born on

                            bitter enemy, Col. Zulkifli Lubis he is a devout Moslem. <persName

                            1945. He rose rapidly in the military service becoming Chief of Staff of
                            the Army in 1948 and following the final achievement of independence
                            continued in this office until 1952.</p>

                            irregular guerrilla element in the Indonesian military establishment.
                            This conflict erupted into the “October 17 Affair” in which <persName

                            take power into his own hands, and hold immediate national elections.

                            ordered an all-out offensive against the Communist stronghold and
                            succeeded in crushing the revolt in a bloody and ruthless fashion. In
                            December of 1950, as Chief of Staff of the Army, he drew strong
                            criticism from <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and the
                            Indonesian Parliament <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0129"/>for a
                            statement to the press strongly implying that Indonesia should take a
                            firm position on the side of the U.S. and the U.N. in the war in Korea.
                            Following the October 17 affair in 1952, he was strongly attacked by the
                            Communist press for his part in the abortive coup, and following his
                            reappointment to the office of Chief of Staff in 1955, was again
                            attacked by Communist representatives on the floor of the Indonesian
                            Parliament. He is credited with preventing the Communist-dominated
                            veterans organization, Perbepsi, from gaining control of the
                            All-Indonesian Veterans Conference which took place in Bandung in
                            December 1956. In March 1957, following <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"

                        <p>In the latter work, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            writes that the Communists place before all else the national interests
                            of the Soviet Union. They hold that if the interests of the Soviets are
                            served, all other interests, including Indonesian national interests,
                            can and must be sacrificed. This conception, he states, cannot be
                            accepted by any Indonesian patriot. In the international sphere,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> makes it clear that
                            the only important outside military threat to Indonesian independence is
                            Communist China. (This was written immediately after Dien-Bien-Phu.) In

                            represents a menace to Indonesian freedom. His advocacy of closer ties

                            outstanding professional soldiers. He is one of a very few in the
                            Indonesian Army who have had formal officer training under the Dutch and
                            served prior to World War II in a commissioned capacity in the
                            Netherlands East Indies Army. He has a superior record as a field
                            officer in the fighting against the Dutch during the revolution, and his
                            published works on military subjects show a broad knowledge of the
                            technical literature of his profession. He has, since Indonesia achieved
                            its independence, devoted himself with single-minded intensity to the
                            task of creating for his country a modern, well-trained, and effective
                            defense establishment. Training of army officers in U.S. service schools

                            and this program has continued without interruption even during the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was one of the principal
                            exponents of a small, professional, and highly trained army, and it was
                            his efforts to reduce the size of the army by retiring non-professional
                            officers and discharging irregular guerrilla units absorbed into the
                            army during the revolution which first brought him into conflict with
                            political leaders and President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and precipitated the October 17th Affair.</p>
                        <p>During the two year period of enforced separation from active military
                            duty <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> continued to work
                            towards his objective. From his own experience in the October 17th
                            Affair, it was apparent to him that the Army would continue to be
                            plagued by irresponsible political meddling in its internal affairs. To
                            meet this problem, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>,
                            with the support of officers on both active and inactive duty,
                            established a political party, <gloss target="#t_IPKI1">IPKI</gloss>,
                            which had as its avowed purpose the representation of army interests in
                            Parliament. <gloss target="#t_IPKI1">IPKI</gloss> succeeded in electing
                            four delegates <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0131"/>in the general
                            elections of September 1955, but in general was not a political success.
                            Whatever its possible usefulness to the Army, Indonesia had no need for
                            one more political party.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> regards
                            as an essential element of a military establishment a rigid code of
                            military discipline. Without a chain of command an army becomes nothing
                            more than a rabble in arms. His preoccupation with discipline can be
                            seen clearly in his actions following his return to the position of
                            Chief of Staff in 1955. The territorial commanders had by 1955 become to
                            all intents and purposes local warlords. They were in many instances
                            local sons who through long service as the military commanders in their
                            home areas had become deeply embroiled in local problems and local
                            aspirations. They obeyed orders from Djakarta when it suited their
                            purposes. This <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> regarded
                            as potentially dangerous, and he instituted a program of regular
                            transfers and tours of duty. Kawilarang in West Java was sent to
                            Washington as military attaché, Warrouw in Celebes was sent to Peiping
                            in a similar capacity, and <persName corresp="#p_Simbolon1"

                        <p>A dominant factor in <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>’s
                            life, clearly evident in his public actions as well as his published
                            works, is a fierce and uncompromising loyalty to the concept of the free
                            and independent Indonesian state. This loyalty appears further to go
                            beyond both his Sumatran Batak origin and his Moslem faith, and
                            determines his attitudes towards his profession, Communism, and the
                            strong regionalist sentiments of many of his brother officers. He is
                            reported to have the support of the <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>, but is at present
                            not known to be associated with any political party. Throughout his
                            books <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> stresses again
                            and again the necessity of Indonesian unity. This preoccupation stems
                            not from the mystic emotionalism of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>, but from a sober conviction that Indonesia as a
                            state cannot long exist if it is not strong internally. Writing in 1955
                            he emphasized that Indonesia had no defense potential whatever until it
                            succeeds in ending the Darul Islam rebellions in West Java, Atjeh, and
                            South Sulawesi. Not only is civil war a source of military weakness, but
                            even worse, a standing invitation to foreign intervention. Both he and
                            General T.B. Simatupang, a fellow Sumatran Batak, point out that
                            Indonesia has in the past fallen under alien control principally because
                            Indonesians have shown a tragic readiness to fight each other. This
                            attitude serves to explain, at least in part, his stand on the
                            regionalist movements and the Padang regime. It is clear that he has no
                            quarrel with their anti-Communist posture, and he may well be in
                            sympathy with their demands for greater regional autonomy. Their resort

                        <p>The dominant influences on <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> appear to be loyalty to Indonesian independence
                            and devotion to his profession. Accepting these as the principal
                            motivating forces, his actions fall into a reasonably consistent
                            pattern, and he emerges as considerably less of an enigma. Like
                            relatively few Indonesians, he thinks in national rather than in local
                            or regional terms—will a certain course of action serve the long-term
                            interests of all of Indonesia, and specifically, will it safeguard
                            Indonesian independence. Like <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>, but for completely different reasons, he is
                            convinced that Indonesia must be united to remain free. He is
                            unquestionably opposed to Communism, both at home and abroad, because he
                            regards it as a threat to this freedom. He would oppose with equal
                            fervor foreign intervention from any quarter. Anti-Communism as such,
                            However, is not a dominant motivating factor, and his actions are
                            clearly not determined in the first instance by the service or
                            disservice they do the Communist cause. He believes in discipline, and
                            this to him means obedience to his superiors and from his subordinates.
                            Transcending even this concept, However, is his loyalty to the republic.
                            If after careful consideration he should decide that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, on balance, has become a
                            divisive rather than unifying force, he would undoubtedly move quickly
                            and decisively to neutralize or eliminate his commander-in-chief. He
                            reaches decisions coldly and logically after sober consideration of all
                            the factors, and once his mind is made up he acts with resolution and
                            firmness. This turn of mind, uncharacteristic of most of his countrymen,
                            has given him a reputation of mental inflexibility. In his
                            self-assurance and dedication to principle he has further tended to
                            ignore the personal and human factors. He has apparently no close
                            friends or confidants, and is admired and respected rather than liked by
                            the colleagues and subordinates. Like most strong personalities, he has
                            also made enemies. His determination to crush the rebels is ascribed in
                            part to the mutual hostility which exists between him and his cousin
                            Zulkifli Lubis, a sentiment which dates at least from the October 17th
                            Affair. He is unquestionably ambitious, but there is in his ambition no
                            discernible strain of self-aggrandizement or megalomania. He is no
                            political theorist, and appears to have no ideological ax to grind. He
                            has no facility for popular leadership, nor the politician’s flair for
                            compromise and the “science of the possible”. Under ordinary
                            circumstances he would appear to be almost the prototype of an effective
                            army chief of staff. The flow of events in Indonesia, However, may force
                            him into a role which he may not be ideally suited, either by talent or
                            temperament.</p>

                            <item>The Secretary</item>
                            <item>Mr. Farley, Special Assistant for Atomic Energy Affairs</item>

                                of Southwest Pacific Affairs</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Ambassador said he wanted to inform the Secretary that the
                            Indonesians have been complaining to the Australian Government that the
                            Australian Broadcasting Company has been sending out too much propaganda
                            in favor of the dissidents in Indonesia. He said that the Australian
                            Government does not intend to stop these broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>2. The Ambassador said he understood we were considering a possible
                            approach to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with the
                            suggestion that if the struggle in Indonesia were settled by compromise
                            we would be prepared to extend economic and military aid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that such an approach is one of the things we have
                            thought about but that no decision has been taken. The difficulty at the
                            moment is that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has
                            things well in hand and is not in a position where he needs to
                            negotiate. A great deal depends, However, on events during the next few
                            days. If the dissidents can hold out then we might take another look at
                            the situation with a view to determining what if anything we might be
                            able to do.</p>
                        <p>3. The Ambassador said that according to Australian intelligence the
                            dissidents are disunited and are not likely to make a successful stand.

                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if the dissidents survive the Central
                            Government’s efforts to suppress them [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] we might have to consider giving
                            them belligerent status but not unless they do better than they have
                            been doing lately.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Australian Government has some anxiety about
                            according recognition to the dissidents and asked whether an approach to
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might be
                            accompanied by a hint that if <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0134"
                            />he does not compromise we would recognize the dissidents. The
                            Secretary said we do not have that possibility in mind at the present
                            time. He agreed with the Ambassador that if the Communists got control
                            of Indonesia it would be a very serious matter, adding that if we could
                            see clearly how to deal with the situation we would be prepared to take
                            some risks if there were any assurance that they might be
                            successful.</p>

                            since then. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said he knows of
                            one—more? AWD does not know. AWD said to <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>
                            it is getting beyond his charter. Things are under consideration but
                            nothing finally decided on that point and AWD imagines that is what they
                            are going to discuss subject to the See’s and the Boss’ approval. The
                                <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said he was talking with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>. AWD thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> might want to discuss it—the handling
                            of it etc. Then he said we are reaching the hour of decision and little
                            time will be left to do that so as to have the impact on what is
                            happening. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> assumed what
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> raised could be done
                            covert. AWD and the <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> agreed he
                            indicated doubt on that. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said if
                            he raises the question, he (who is stout-hearted) feels there is doubt.
                            AWD said he is on the spot. AWD mentioned some inconsistency. AWD said
                            we can just have the meeting and have it ad referendum to the <gloss
                                target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> and the Boss. The <gloss
                                target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said if you decide no, he would <pb
                                n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0135"/>not think there need be any
                            referendum. AWD said he would raise points about other types of American
                            personnel—not employed by us. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss>
                            said if the Pres is going to take it up, he would like to be in on the
                            discussion. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said he thinks the
                            important thing is to try to develop some of the lines he raised
                            Sunday—find a political basis to do it overt rather than get caught
                            covert. The <gloss target="#t_Sec1">Sec</gloss> said the only thing now
                            is to study it. If there is a possibility of action along this line,
                            then discuss with the Pres, and if he thinks it worth pursuing then get
                            word to these people we are giving consideration to it and if they
                            survive the first assault then they could look forward to something. If
                            the Executive thinks there is a possibility see if these people are
                            willing to accept it especially with the Sumatran thing which seems to
                            have the greatest degree of possibility.</p>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName></item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We first discussed the question of whether or not the United States
                            should be tolerant of U.S. nationals acting on a purely private and
                            “soldier-of-fortune” basis (e.g. CAT) in performing services for the
                            patriots in Sumatra. The President indicated that he did not want any
                            U.S. Government personnel or persons detached from the U.S. Government
                            only for the purpose of taking part in any operations partaking of a
                            military character in Indonesia. But he did not think we should extend
                            this principle to private persons operating on their own.</p>
                        <p>I then discussed the future, pointing out that it did not seem likely
                            that the patriots could gain a victory or in the long run sustain
                            themselves <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0136"/>without overt
                            support from outside. On the other hand it seemed as though their
                            willingness to fight needed to be better demonstrated before they would
                            be entitled to overt support. This willingness to fight might, however,
                            in turn be promoted if they knew that if they fought vigorously and well
                            and accepted some casualties, there was some future ahead.</p>
                        <p>I suggested [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] a communication to the leadership of the patriots
                            on a highly confidential basis that our feeling is if they put up a
                            stubborn resistance to the imminent attack by the Central Government
                            threatened on the West Coast off Padang, the United States would be
                            disposed to consider some form of recognition which might permit of
                            overt support from the U.S. or Asian countries which might join in that
                            recognition. On the other hand, if they did not show a real will to
                            fight and dedication to their cause, they could not expect such
                            support.</p>
                        <p>We discussed various alternatives which recognition might take. One was
                            the recognition of belligerency against the Central Government. Another
                            was recognition of the government of the Sumatran State on the
                            assumption, however, that that state would be part of an Indonesian
                            federation as soon as an appropriate constitution was adopted. A third
                            step was merely to recognize them as the de facto government of the area
                            they controlled. A fourth measure that might be considered was for the
                            United States to land forces for the protection of American life and
                            property on Sumatra, notably at the oil fields.</p>
                        <p>I recommended against this latter course on the ground that the use of
                            the U.S. military to protect oil interests in that part of the world
                            would receive a very adverse reaction. The President authorized a
                            message, as indicated, leaving for further study the question of what
                            form of recognition should be favored in the event that there was the
                            kind of active fighting by the patriots which would justify giving
                            consideration to such a move given the international practice in these
                            matters and the national interest of the United States which was also a
                            factor, often indeed a controlling factor, in matters of diplomatic
                            “recognition”. [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not

                            <item>increasing conviction on part GOI military that <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is actually aiding rebels.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Both of these developments have been clearly established in opinion all
                            elements Embassy.</p>
                        <p>It is self-evident that with regard to second point growing conviction of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support to rebels, whether or not
                            actual proof is available, may cause loss of long and carefully
                            nourished relations with Indonesian Army. It is unanimous view Embassy
                            staff that pro-American officers still hold balance of power in army but
                            this could be upset by development such conviction.</p>
                        <p>I should like therefore to pursue thought included in my recommendations
                            sent you separately April 6<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">Not further
                                identified. This telegram was probably not sent through normal
                                Department of State communications channels.</note> but based upon
                            analysis situation Embassy reference telegrams. As I see it, army is
                            becoming more and more likely determine future course followed by
                            Indonesia. It is gathering more and more power and authority unto itself
                            in both political and economic spheres. If army remains anti-Communist I
                            believe it can be induced to take positive action to prevent Communist
                            takeover by political means or otherwise. In any event, if new
                            anti-Communist government is formed, it must depend upon army for
                            support and implementation its policy. If such government is not formed,
                            then we may find army is sole remaining major asset in preventing
                            Communist take-over Java.</p>
                        <p>Army does not regard struggle with rebels as battle between Communists
                            and anti-Communists and neither do most influential Indonesians <pb
                                n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0138"/>here so consider it. See for
                            example <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>’s comments in
                            Embtel 3312.<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4"><ref target="#d46">Document

                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and
                            American-trained officers with whom he has surrounded himself are all
                            regarded as strongly anti-Communist.</p>
                        <p>With or without a political settlement which includes rebel demands we
                            favor, Indonesian Army foreseeable future will remain major power factor
                            which we must continue to influence in our direction. While gesture may
                            not completely counteract (2) above, absence of support is certain to be
                            taken as substantiation their suspicion and evidence complete lack of
                            sympathy.</p>
                        <p>If we want to save Java it appears impossible to base policy solely on
                            Padang even if Padang can win real military victory. I have always
                            thought of Padang—and I think you agree—as a tactic, as a means of
                            bringing leverage on situation in Java to force new political direction
                            on central government. I think Padang as a tactic has already succeeded
                            to this extent: precipitation of issues has resulted in increased
                            awareness of them here.</p>
                        <p>I recognize arguments on other side. Briefly summarized, they are: (1)
                            effect on rebel morale of any <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> gesture
                            toward GOI military; (2) interpretation of move as support for <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and present government; (3)
                            confirming <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in policy
                            playing off <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> against Communist bloc and
                            obtaining aid from both; (4) removing in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s mind necessity for reaching agreement with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and reorganization of
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I shall deal with each of these briefly: <list>

                                <item>I believe this can be overcome by conditions which might be

                                    us, since army may be only strong counterweight to

                                    aid or lack of it. However, extension of military aid will put

                                    arguments in favor of doing nothing here may be outweighed by
                                    possibility irretrievable damage our position in current

                            April to students in Djakarta, denied accusations that he is a
                            Communist. He explained that these accusations result from a
                            misunderstanding of his own efforts to combat colonialism and capitalism
                            and to find working solutions for Indonesia’s numerous economic and
                            political problems, as well as from a misinterpretation of Indonesia’s

                                facs="0141"/>in which he explained himself as peculiarly endowed to
                            screen and blend all trends and ideologies into a philosophy which would
                            be right for Indonesia. He said that although he is a follower of Karl
                            Marx, he is also a religious man and understands “the entire scope
                            between Marxism and religion… .<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1">Ellipsis in

                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has repeatedly
                            stated and appears to believe that basically he can be a Marxist, can
                            establish a socialist state, and can use Communist techniques without
                            threatening Indonesia with Communism. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"

                            his own attitudes toward Marxism and Islam since he sees the former as

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, now aged
                            57, plays three political roles which are variously emphasized in
                            relation to his audience and surroundings. These are (1) a more or less
                            constitutional president in a more or less parliamentary cabinet system
                            of government; (2) a national revolutionary leader in a newly
                            independent country which is involved in political, economic, and social
                            changes; and (3) an Asian potentate in whom the Indonesians, but
                            particularly the 50,000,000 Javanese—most of them poor, ignorant,
                            superstitious, and starved for excitement and color—see the embodiment
                            of a mystical, divinely endowed, and foreordained king.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> enjoys the second and
                            third roles far more than the first and is far better qualified to fill
                            them than he is the first. He has all the theatrical techniques of the
                            consummate crowd-pleaser and is in fact a rabble-rouser when he wishes.
                            He has a insatiable desire for public acclaim and wishes to hold all the
                            reins of power and to be the originator of all major decisions. Yet he
                            refuses to accept definite responsibility and is childishly jealous when
                            anyone else appears to share the acclaim usually accorded him or to
                            assume responsibility which might lead to the loss of any of his power.
                            In one important particular, he has virtually no knowledge of economics
                            and no appreciation of the complex economic problems which afflict the
                            nation. He is vain and pleasure loving to a marked degree.</p>
                        <p>Paralleling these characteristics is an identification with Indonesia and
                            with a dream of Indonesia as a strong, united nation—the home of a
                            prosperous and confident people. In relation to Indonesians, <persName

                            study, interpret, and blend the best and most appropriate of the modern
                            world with the best of whatever he sees as genuinely Indonesian, to
                            create a truly Indonesian nation. This is a superhuman order for one
                            person, or even one generation, but <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s vanity and ego refuse to let him share the

                        <p>In addition, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has led a
                            life of tension which has repeatedly included revolution, insurrection,
                            imprisonment, exile, conspiracy, and attempted assassination. This
                            undoubtedly tends to emphasize and exaggerate many of his personality

                                Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs</item>
                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MJG1">Mein</persName>, Director, Office
                                of Southwest Pacific Affairs</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained he had
                            asked the Ambassador to come in to correct an impression he had
                            evidently gathered from a conversation with someone concerning possible
                            action by the United States in the Indonesian situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that our Ambassador
                            in Wellington had reported that Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NW2">Nash</persName> had been informed by Sir
                                <persName>Leslie</persName> that the U.S. was planning to intervene
                            with force in Indonesia, and that the Prime Minister felt he must make a
                            public statement on this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0143"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> told the Ambassador
                            that the U.S. is not considering going into Indonesia with force. He
                            reviewed briefly the picture on Sumatra, pointing out that the
                            dissidents at the present time controlled very little of the area and
                            were giving up Padang and other areas without a fight. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he agreed with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NW2">Nash</persName> that nothing could
                            be more catastrophic than our going in with force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Department would inform our Embassy at Wellington of this, pointing out
                            that Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSL3">Leslie</persName> must have been
                            misinformed or must have misunderstood his informant.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s statement meant in effect that the U.S. had
                            written off the rebels. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied in the negative, adding that from the
                            information available to us it appears that a stalemate might develop
                            and that as a result of this and the deteriorating economic situation a
                            compromise may be worked out. He indicated we would welcome a compromise
                            since we fear that if the dissidents are wiped out or disappear,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and other moderates may
                            lose any leverage they may have and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> may become difficult to deal with. He pointed
                            out that many people are of the opinion that the army may be the only
                            element capable of checking the Communists. Nothing in the situation,
                            therefore, would justify such action as the Ambassador had been given to
                            understand we were contemplating.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSL3">Leslie</persName> said that he wanted Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to know that he had
                            not gotten the information from anybody in the State Department, but he
                            also wanted to make it clear that he had not misunderstood his
                            informant. Sir <persName corresp="#p_MSL3">Leslie</persName> assured Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> he would convey the
                            information given to him to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NW2"
                                >Nash</persName>.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> personally confirmed the
                            foregoing to <persName corresp="#p_BCJ1">Colonel Berlin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>During our conversation, <persName corresp="#p_BCJ1">Colonel
                                Berlin</persName> expressed his opinion that Indonesia is rapidly
                            going communist—that certain Cabinet Portfolios, which are the early
                            beach heads of communist penetration, such as the Ministry of
                            Information, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Trade Unions, are already
                            held by known communists. He regretted that he had no ready solution to
                            offer which was feasible, and which would be sure of stopping the
                            deteriorating situation. He did, however, state that there are elements
                            and individuals within the government who are aware of the danger and
                            who are in a position to show some effectiveness in retrieving the
                            situation. His assessment of certain key figures follows:</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>, the Prime Minister, is
                            anti-communist and believes that once the Central Government can control
                            that part of Sumatra which it believes essential to its economy, it will
                            cease fighting. Then, under the leadership of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> (who refuses to rejoin the
                            government until the fighting is ended) the anti-communists will take
                            steps to regain control.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, Chief of Staff of the
                            Army, is anti-communist, and although loyal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, is resentful of the
                            latter’s interference in Army affairs. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> is politically ambitious and might be receptive
                            to ideas which would further that ambition.</p>
                        <p>Barlian, Commander of South Sumatra, is strongly anti-communist and,
                            while not declaring himself for the dissidents as hoped for, has refused
                            to take up arms against them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> appears to be
                            completely in the pocket of the communists. Although his stature in the
                            eyes of the intelligentia has definitely diminished, he still has a
                            tremendous popular following and probably could not be successfully
                            challenged by any single individual.</p>

                        <p>Queried as to what might be done, Colonel <persName corresp="#p_BCJ1"

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> might be

                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The question
                                of approach is delicate and the U.S. must be prepared to disavow
                                sponsorship.</item>

                                favorable influence over the Army.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Colonel <persName corresp="#p_BCJ1">Berlin</persName> repeatedly
                            emphasized the danger of failing to act promptly to rally those forces
                            in the GOI which may be in a position to do some good. It seems unlikely
                            that the situation will develop in which the United States can take any
                            sort of military action, although this is still a possibility. If the
                            dissidents fail to win over additional supporters and fail to retain
                            control over a considerable portion of Sumatra, the Central Government
                            will be entrenched without serious jeopardy. The only force in the GOI
                            which will prevent that government from becoming communist is in the
                            Army. I agree with you that we should do everything that we can to
                            encourage the anti-communist elements in the GOI to exert all the
                            influence possible to prevent the communist domination of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> apparently has a
                            firm grasp of the situation and perhaps he could offer some suggestions
                            as to how <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> could be
                            approached and how to build up the anti-communist forces in the Army and
                            the GOI. If we could act on his suggestions quickly and at the same time

                                liquidation of the dissident movement in Indonesia can be prevented
                                only by overt U.S. military assistance to them. In the absence of a
                                timely decision to take such action, the United States must seek
                                other means to achieve our basic objective of preventing the
                                communists from taking over all of Indonesia.</item>

                            <item>There are continuing indications that the Indonesian Army under
                                the Chief of Staff, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>, if given some positive gesture of support by
                                this government, might emerge as an anti-communist force in Java.
                                Prior to the current military operations, the Indonesian Army under
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was considered
                                to be the strongest anti-communist force in Indonesia. U.S. support
                                of <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, or other
                                influential Indonesian Army leaders arranged through appropriate
                                channels, might influence him to take positive action to prevent a
                                communist take-over by political or other means. This does not mean
                                that the dissident forces should be abandoned. It should be clearly
                                understood that the provision of material or financial support to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> or the Central

                                influence from the Central Government and the cessation of

                        <p>On April 24 at the 363d meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> opened his
                            intelligence briefing with a discussion of developments in Indonesia:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence indicated that dissident
                                    resistance on Sumatra had practically collapsed in the course of
                                    the last week. There seemed to be no willingness to fight on the
                                    part of the dissident forces on the island, and the dissident
                                    leaders had been unable to provide their soldiers with any idea
                                    of why they were fighting. It was a very strange war, because
                                    each side was penetrated by the other, and each knew in detail
                                    the forthcoming moves of the other. Our people there had had a
                                    very frustrating time. While it was impossible to judge what the
                                    capabilities of the dissidents for guerrilla operations might
                                    prove to be, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> doubted whether
                                    very much could be expected on the basis of past performance.
                                    Meanwhile, the Central Government was mounting an attack on the
                                    dissidents in the Celebes, and Lt. Col. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_SLC1">Sumual</persName> and his troops seemed to
                                    have somewhat more fight in them than had the dissident forces
                                    on Sumatra. Nevertheless, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                    doubted if they <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0148"/>could
                                    hold out long. Accordingly, we were pretty close to the end of
                                    organized dissident resistance to Djakarta. As for <persName

                                    action, this was extremely difficult to estimate.</p>
                                <p>“The President said it looked to him as though we might well have
                                    to mount an operation against Sumatra if Communism appeared
                                    about to take over.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                            said that these two dangers in combination were highlighted in the
                            persons of both <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that in his
                            view <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was probably
                            worse than <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> since <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> dealt with the communists
                            not only in the international field but also used their support
                            domestically, whereas <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            apparently confined his dealings with them to the international sphere.
                            At this point Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> commented that it appeared that the United States
                            was going to have <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on
                            its hands in Indonesia since the dissident movement had all but
                            completely collapsed. The Secretary said that it <pb n="123"
                                xml:id="pg_123" facs="0149"/>seemed to be the way things were going,
                            adding that the rebels at no time had shown any inclination to
                            fight.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then said that as far as the Netherlands was
                            concerned the problem of Indonesia had become one of preventing its
                            take-over by the communists. Dutch citizens were moving out of Indonesia
                            rapidly and the Dutch had gradually accommodated themselves to the fact
                            that their economic holdings and interests were lost. Dutch possessions
                            such as plantations and warehouses had already begun to deteriorate
                            substantially and under Indonesian management or lack thereof they could
                            be expected to deteriorate further. The impact on the Indonesian economy
                            was severe since economic relations with the Netherlands accounted for
                            approximately 50% of the Indonesian national income (these relations
                            amount to only 3% of the Dutch national income). There were, of course,
                            the Foreign Minister said, certain residual problems and he cited in
                            this connection the problems of Indonesian refugees in the Netherlands.
                            The Foreign Minister commented that both he and the Secretary would
                            probably miss the problem of Dutch-Indonesian relations since he had had
                            many occasions to discuss it with the Secretary in the past.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked the Foreign Minister for his views on West New
                            Guinea. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            said that he had intended to mention West New Guinea to the Secretary
                            because he thought that there was a potential development in that area
                            which should be carefully watched. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> after successfully defeating the dissidents
                            might undertake military action against West New Guinea. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might be impelled into such
                            a venture by the communists or might undertake it to divert attention
                            from internal problems in Indonesia. The Dutch Government had no
                            evidence at the present time that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> intended such a move. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said, however, that he wished to
                            raise it because he thought it was a possibility which we should keep in
                            mind. The Secretary asked about the state of Dutch defenses in the area.
                            The Foreign Minister said that for the time being they had sufficient
                            military forces in West New Guinea to take care of any attack. He
                            mentioned the following components: 2 new destroyers, 1 old destroyer,
                            auxiliary naval craft, 2,000 Royal Dutch Marines, 24 fighter planes (not
                            jets) and 18 amphibious planes. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then said that recent Indonesian
                            purchases of jet planes did give him concern and this would be increased
                            when Indonesian pilots had completed the necessary flight training. The
                            Secretary suggested that this might not be too far away since Indonesian
                            pilots were currently being trained in Egypt and Czechoslovakia. He
                            added, however, that jet planes did not seem to him the type of
                            equipment which could be used either against the dissident movement in
                            the outer islands or against West New Guinea. He assumed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wanted these <pb n="124"
                                xml:id="pg_124" facs="0150"/>planes since they had come to be
                            considered the modern dictator’s symbol of power.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether there was any unrest within West New Guinea.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied
                            that there was none and that the natives cooperated fully with the local
                            administration. He said that they were able to deal easily with very
                            minor attempts at infiltration of one or two agitators at a time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> explained that the
                            natives either apprehended and reported these agitators to the local
                            administration or they ate the agitators. He said there was only one
                            variation to this latter practice and that existed among the more
                            Christianized natives who would only eat fishermen on Fridays.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reverted to the serious internal problems which exist in
                            Indonesia and said that the United States might decide that it was in
                            its interest to provide Indonesia with a small amount of assistance. He
                            explained that this would give the United States an opportunity to
                            retain some influence on the Indonesian situation by giving the
                            Indonesians the impression that they could play both sides. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> commented that if
                            the United States did decide to give Indonesia some aid he hoped that
                            the Indonesians would be reminded of their international obligations.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> asked what
                            kind of things we had in mind furnishing the Indonesians. The Secretary
                            replied that we were thinking about releasing some rice to them. This
                            request, he explained, had been on our books for some time and in view
                            of the local serious food situation it might be desirable to go ahead
                            and supply Indonesia with a small amount of rice. In response to a
                            question, the Secretary said that we did not have the intention of
                            furnishing military assistance to Indonesia.<note n="1" xml:id="d71fn1"

                            were joined by <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>. The
                            meeting lasted approximately 1-1/2 hours after which the Secretary met

                            substantial military aid, as long as it was not used against the

                        <p>3965. Foreign Minister summoned me this morning at 9 a.m. to request
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> mediation with Government of
                            Republic of China on supply of arms to rebels and informed me that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> would make strong
                            speech today charging foreign intervention and make a plea for <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance in preventing further
                            deliveries to rebels.</p>
                        <p>Documents which had been captured proved that rebels in Sumatra had
                            received 10,000 small arms in addition to bazookas, artillery and planes
                            and their sources of information in Menado had reported 3,000 items
                            small arms supplied recently. Possession by Menado of three bombers and
                            two Mustangs plus cost of air raids which they had verified at $75,000
                            per raid, had made it evident to Indonesian Government that rebels were
                            not equipping themselves from own sources of revenue but were receiving
                            actual assistance in form of military equipment from foreign government
                            sources. He was not accusing the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of
                            being involved, he said, and neither would Prime Minister in speech, but
                            GOI had established fact that planes were from Taiwan and they were
                            being piloted by Americans and Chinese, and Prime Minister would say
                            so.</p>
                        <p>He made strong plea for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> taking some
                            action in response to his request if for no other reason than to prevent
                            serious reaction against Chinese Kuomintang community in Indonesia.
                            There was basic undercurrent of hatred against Chinese in Indonesia
                            anyway, he said, and continued evidence of Taiwan participation in
                            active aid to rebels might well be spark setting off explosion.</p>
                        <p>Everyone knew <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government had great
                            influence with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> whereas Indonesian
                            Government, not recognizing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>, was not
                            in position to make direct formal protest. He hoped <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government would undertake this on behalf
                            GOI.</p>
                        <p>I made no comment on Foreign Minister’s request except to say that I
                            would transmit it to Department. Foreign Minister did not at any point
                            charge <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> with official participation
                            in aid to rebels but indicated that use of facilities was not possible
                            without at least knowledge or blessing of government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I think at this stage it would be most
                            helpful to us here if Line White could mention Foreign Minister’s
                            request and indicate <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government would
                            discuss matter with <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in accordance
                            therewith, without of course admitting implication <gloss

                                xml:id="pg_127" facs="0153"/>be helpful if this could be coupled
                            with repetition of previous statements to effect that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> regards conflict as Indonesian affair and
                            that it is against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy to intervene
                            in internal struggle.</p>
                        <p>In my view this would tend discourage growing conviction here that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government is directly involved,
                            continuing identification of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with
                            rebel cause certain to provide Communists with unparalleled opportunity

                            telegram Foreign Minister discussed for nearly an hour current political
                            situation in Indonesia and thinking of leaders within government,
                            particularly himself and <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>,
                            and leaders of <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>. Basic theme of this
                            presentation was realization that growth of communism within Indonesia
                            must be halted by democratic means or otherwise and that this was point
                            on which all responsible elements in official and political area
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister opened discussion by saying that he recognized that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had great confidence in Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and that we considered
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>’s participation in a
                            reorganized government as signal that government would be anti-Communist
                            in orientation and one with which we could actively cooperate. He
                            inquired as to whether this was not generally accurate. I replied by
                            saying that it was of course true that Americans had confidence in Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>, that we considered him
                            an able administrator and that there was general feeling America that he
                            represented policies which were in interest of Indonesia. Foreign
                            Minister pressed this further by inquiring whether Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>’s known anti-Communist attitude
                            was perhaps not major element in this reaction. I replied that this was
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>He then launched into exposition of efforts to get President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> to work together. He said quite
                            frankly that in <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0154"/>very real sense
                            both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> constituted difficult problem for
                            Indonesians because of great difficulty in past as well as present of
                            getting them to work together. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was imaginative, creative, magnetic, with
                            capacity to appeal to the masses but with no patience with details of
                            administration or implementation of general policy. One could not
                            discuss economic or financial questions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, for example. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was always the political
                            leader, flexible, adjustable within the overall framework of his
                            emotional rationalism. <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> was
                            rigid, inflexible, competent administrator, impatient with political
                            conceptions, hard working and interested in doing something instead of
                            talking or dreaming. He implied desirability of getting these two men to
                            work together in view of their complementary characteristics was only
                            equalled by difficulty of bringing this about. He hoped, however, that
                            it would be possible to get <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>
                            back into government and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>
                            would have another talk after Sumatran business was finished.</p>
                        <p>However, he said, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be making great
                            mistake if our policy was based on assumption that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> was key to anti-Communist
                            attitude in Indonesia. He said Dr. <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName>, himself, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> and, a bit late perhaps, <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> leadership here equally anti-Communist.
                            Present government recognized that coming year was most critical in
                            Indonesia’s history and that during this year growth of communism in
                            Indonesia must be halted. Last thing that Indonesians wanted was for
                            their country to go Communist. He himself had serious question whether
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> increase could be stopped by
                            democratic means. He agreed with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            analysis to this extent—if <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> won even
                            so much as 30 or 35 percent of votes at next election which he thought
                            was probable unless something were done to counteract it, Indonesia
                            would go Communist.</p>
                        <p>At same time <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and Leftist elements
                            were doing utmost to capitalize on rebel opposition and in effect turn
                            this into Communist-anti-Communist battle. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had three times told <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that as long as he was
                            Prime Minister he would not permit <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            to capitalize on current conflict in such a way as to turn GOI course
                            more to left. Indonesian Government wanted and needed to feel closer to
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in this current period, he said.
                            Elements within political parties and government who were friendly to
                            America needed some gesture from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to
                            enable them to counter accusation that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            had deserted legitimate Government of Indonesia and was backing
                                rebels.<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">On April 30 President <persName

                        <p>Foreign Minister replied frankly that he did not think <persName

                            this way of thinking, but they were working on him and after settlement
                            current conflict army could be brought into picture more directly. He
                            could not answer second question specifically, but result of <gloss

                            tomorrow would be significant. Both <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> had failed
                            to curb growth of communism. Now was country’s last chance and <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> would have to adopt vigorous program.
                            Even so, he reiterated he was not convinced that <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> could be disposed of in democratic manner. If not, army
                            which was still strongly anti-Communist must be used. If tactics within
                            democratic framework were to be successful silver tongue of <persName

                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> activity was carried on by
                            professional, trained organizers working full time at job and moving
                            from place to place. Non-Communist political parties were rank amateurs
                            in spare time who could not meet competition of professionals. GOI had
                            no proof as to how hard working, effective <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> was financed but they assume it was financed through
                            Soviet and Communist Chinese governments. In response to my query he
                            admitted they had to make similar assumption that <gloss

                            Indonesian interest but to interests of outside power. History had
                            demonstrated that if a country went Communist there was no going back.
                            Democracy ceased functioning at point where Communist Party took over
                            government.</p>
                        <p>This led to conclusion that if effective opposition to <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> within democratic framework was to be
                            developed, some means must be found to influence masses now becoming

                            organization. Only weapon they could see was voice of <persName

                        <p>On May 1 at the 364th meeting of the National Security Council, <persName

                            developments during his intelligence briefing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Turning to the situation in Indonesia, Mr.
                                        <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that dissident
                                    forces based on Menado had staged an amphibious operation and
                                    seized Morotai, situated in Helmahera Island and one of the best
                                    airfields in Indonesia. From the base at Menado the dissidents
                                    have staged a successful series of air strikes—almost too
                                    effective in certain instances, since they had resulted in the
                                    sinking of a British and of a Panamanian freighter. These raids
                                    were still run on a shoestring basis with a few P–51S and
                                    B–26s.</p>
                                <p>“Meanwhile, on Sumatra dissident resistance has now been reduced
                                    to guerrilla operations. The dissident leaders have stayed
                                    behind in the Sumatran hills.</p>
                                <p>“The Indonesian Army has given some indications, through various
                                    channels, that it would like to acquire U.S. weapons and then
                                    turn against the Communists. While such reports must be treated
                                    with reserve, there is still some hope that the regular
                                    Indonesian Army might turn against the Communists. The President
                                    commented that it would be a great success if the dissidents
                                    could seize Macassar.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                            GOI, using all means and strength available to it, is confident she will
                            shortly destroy all rebel remnants in eastern part of Indonesia.
                            Embassy’s Military Attachés believe that establishment of military
                            command under Colonel <persName>Rukmito</persName> in Central Sulawesi
                            is indication that GOI plans further military action in Central and
                            North Sulawesi as soon as possible after completion action in Sumatra.
                            Attachés also believe recent bombings either by rebels or on rebels’
                            behalf have served to stiffen GOI resolve to settle issue by force.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s statement lays
                            groundwork for increased public support of such action by making
                            possible transformation of civil war, or internal police action, into
                            fight against foreigners and foreign supporters of rebel cause. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s lead is followed,
                            original issues may well come out of focus entirely and rebel goal of
                            reformed, non-Communist, “constitutional” government may be lost sight
                            of completely as struggle becomes identified as part of cold war and
                            thus an international affair. If this happens, however, issues
                            unfortunately will not be Communist/anti-Communist to Indonesians, but
                            Indonesians versus foreign interventionists and public opinion here will
                            be easily marshalled against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Whatever chances may previously have been for settlement by negotiation
                            or compromise, they would appear to have considerably dimmed as result
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s charges of foreign
                            intervention. If GOI continues this tack, possibility of overt Soviet
                            assistance, even Soviet “volunteers” should not be ignored although GOI
                            would unquestionably withhold approval until last extremity. In one
                            portion <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> makes this clear
                            when he warns that aid provided to rebels by American and Taiwan
                            adventurers might invite “other quarters” to interfere and thus make
                            Indonesia battleground for interests of foreign powers. Whether this
                            materializes may depend to considerable degree, in Embassy’s view, on
                            response which <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> makes to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s appeal that American <pb

                            providing aid to rebels and on whether GOI has cause for believing
                            “American adventurers” are continuing to assist rebels. Simultaneous

                        <p>4028. Foreign Minister summoned me this morning to discuss rebel bombings
                            and evidence American adventurers and Taiwan involvement operations. He
                            made strong plea for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government to do
                            anything it could vis-à-vis Government of Republic of China, or
                            otherwise, to stop bombings.</p>
                        <p>Some within Indonesian Government believed, he said, that these bombings
                            were prelude to war. Both <persName>Admiral</persName> Subijakto<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d78fn1">Commander of the Indonesian Navy.</note> and
                            Air Marshal <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName> had
                            advised Prime Minister and President that they convinced American naval
                            and air forces are planning attack Indonesia. He said neither President,
                            Prime Minister, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> nor
                            himself believed this but cited it as example of intense emotionalism
                            within Indonesian Government this whole subject. He further said
                            killings of innocent people by bombings has resulted in such strong
                            reaction <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0160"/>within Indonesia
                            against rebels that (a) rebel movement has become object violent popular
                            reaction in Ambon and other places and (b) difficulty of GOI settling
                            conflict at this time immeasurably increased.</p>
                        <p>He said both he and <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had
                            deprecated talk within Indonesian Government of breaking off diplomatic
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. In this connection he
                            said Indonesian Government found itself on horns of most serious
                            dilemma: In America lay its main hope of aid in opposition communism yet
                            Indonesians were convinced that America was actively helping rebels. He
                            said forces within government had wanted to include direct charge to
                            this effect in <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s
                            statement but that <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> was
                            unwilling to accept this because he felt it would play into hands of
                            Communists and alienate America at critical stage.</p>
                        <p>He reported interesting conversation between himself, <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> yesterday in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had told the President that
                            what Communists have been in past they will be in future and that
                            present cooperative attitude was mere matter of tactics. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had said flatly “Indonesian
                            Communists are run by international Communists and cannot be trusted.”
                            Result of long conference was that President had agreed that <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> could “exist but must grow no
                            stronger.” He said President had finally become convinced that four leg

                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> represented alien, not
                            indigenous element and that guided democracy meant indigenous democracy
                            and had no element of communism within it. I urged <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to attempt induce <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to make this clear in
                            public statement.</p>
                        <p>In connection with strong appeal for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            help in matter of bombings, and other gestures of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> support for Indonesia, Foreign Minister returned to
                            question of arms. Army is the key to effective anti-Communist action in
                            Indonesia, he said, “Don’t antagonize the army.” He indicated
                            anti-American sentiment in army was growing as result of conviction
                            strong <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for rebels and urged
                            America to do something soon which would reverse this trend.</p>
                        <p>In connection with discussion bombings he said “Please help us not to
                            accelerate conflict but to bring it to close” and at this point he said
                            evidence of foreign assistance was so great that if conflict was not
                            settled soon Indonesian Government planned bring matter before <gloss

                        <p>He then went into discussion of evidence foreign assistance to rebels. He
                            first showed me an intercepted cable to Colonel
                                <persName>Djambek</persName> in Bukittinggi from <persName>R. S.

                        <p>He also said they had uncovered documents linking <persName

                            Security Bureau in Taiwan, with supply of planes. These documents
                            revealed, he said, referring to intelligence report, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> had turned over C–47s to rebels
                            and that planes were piloted by American pilots and Chinese co-pilots.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> had taken this action
                            on instructions of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy in Singapore,
                            he alleged documents revealed. He also said they had proof that General
                            Li Chung Sie was with rebels as military adviser. This man sometimes has
                            been known by name of Lie Chi-chun and Indonesian intelligence circles
                            refer to him commonly as C.C. Li. He is a long-time <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> intelligence operator with serial
                            number of 2621–1504-6108, he said and formerly was active in Indonesia
                            as Kuomintang intelligence agent.</p>
                        <p>He further said that financial information obtained showed that total
                            barter deals consummated by rebels amounted to from 8 to 10 million
                            Straits dollars. He said complaints already received by GOI from
                            merchants in Singapore to effect 3 million Straits dollars for rice,
                            armored cars and road equipment have not been paid and are long overdue.
                            He said Chinese merchants Singapore had made large commissions out of
                            actions and indicated considerable bad faith involved. This was reason
                            for assassination of Wan Tan Nea in Menado by rebels recently. Wan Tan
                            was formerly Indonesian Army lieutenant stationed in Bandung.</p>
                        <p>Connection with above “evidence” I pointed out telegram from American in
                            San Francisco, of whom I had never heard, constituted no evidence
                            whatever of American official or unofficial involvement—that on face of
                            it this was merely businessman trying to make sale and that reference to
                            arms available did not even mean these arms were available within <gloss

                            stocks in many countries.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister quickly cut in and denied any implication of American
                            Government involvement in what he or <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> had said but that he felt evidence was
                            sufficient to prove that rebels were receiving outside assistance and
                            that he felt if <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government desired to
                            do so it could be helpful in situation. I pointed out that Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had opened door by saying he would
                            welcome any suggestions from Foreign Minister on this subject. Foreign
                            Minister repeated request Embassy telegram 3965, saying he felt approach

                            he was asking was any help which we could give by way of discouraging

                        <p>He then returned to subject of Communism and <persName

                            were identical on this point although ideas and method might differ.
                            What President has been talking about, he said, is indigenous democracy
                            and they recognize <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0162"/>that <gloss

                            leaders have told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            that they would do anything he wanted they did not insist on being in

                        <p>President yesterday also queried: “Why do Americans think I am Communist

                            Communist. Communists want power. I do not seek power. How many times

                            it was important to our mutual relations that sensitive subject of this

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: 1. Foreign Minister was obviously anxious
                            to accomplish two things: (A) Provide me with an understanding of
                            feeling of desperation bombings had created in GOI; (B) demonstrate that
                            in spite of everything, GOI felt it must have support of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> if growth communism to be halted.
                            Although trying to impress me with seriousness Indonesian reaction to
                            “foreign bombing” and making fairly strong remarks, his manner was most
                            cordial and as I left, he said, appealingly, “you think we can
                            straighten out these things, don’t you?” I replied in affirmative but
                            not to be misunderstood as acceding to his specific request, spelled out
                            desire of my government to help Indonesia, but emphasizing difficulty of
                            so doing in current situation.</p>
                        <p>2. At luncheon in honor Indian Ambassador, immediately following
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> interview, British
                            Ambassador drew me aside to obtain brief rundown of conversation. He
                            then commented that in his view it was absolutely essential for two
                            things to be done at once: (A) Bombings must somehow be brought to stop
                            or situation will get out of hand; (B) Indonesian military must be
                            provided with at least part of what it asks—both from <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and British sources. He doesn’t see how
                            we can lose by taking such action.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> interview covered
                            two-hour period so I have not attempted to give play-by-play account and
                            in interest of space have omitted most of my comments and rejoinders
                            designed in each case to spur <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"

                        <p>In the Northern Celebes, however, there was more activity and a rickety

                        <p>At the present we were trying to talk with friendly elements in Djakarta

                            solution. The Secretary said he was very skeptical. Although <persName

                            undependable, we were trying to see what was possible in this regard.
                            The leaders in Sumatra were all right, but their troops had refused to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> raised the question of

                            consequences for us throughout the Far East. He said we might have

                            fought. He concluded by saying that although the situation was very

                                >Subandrio</persName> was only other person present. Prime Minister
                            seemed to fear that relations between <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            and Indonesia were at cross roads and that next few days might determine
                            outcome.</p>
                        <p>He started out by saying that he had originally hoped that capture of
                            Padang and Bukittinggi would make it possible to bring about political
                            settlement in conflict with rebels. Foreign bombings however had
                            introduced new element which had so aroused Indonesians that government
                            was determined to push on with military campaign. He knew that there was
                            internal conflict in Minnehasa and until bombings took place government
                            had simply planned to blockade Menado and let matter settle itself over
                            period of time. Now this was no longer possible. He had made every
                            effort to draft his statement of April 30 in such a way that no specific
                            accusations were made against us but he implied he knew we were involved
                            and could not understand our motives. It now looked to GOI as if purpose
                            of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was to split Indonesia in two in
                            order to insure that one part of Indonesia at least would remain
                            non-Communist. This would be tragic for everybody, he said. It would be
                            playing into hands of Communists who had been delighted by predicament
                            in which bombings had placed both GOI and <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was making capital
                            of this, he said, endeavoring to induce President and cabinet to take
                            steps from which there would be no return and President himself was so
                            furious that it was with greatest difficulty <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> had been able to persuade him not to make speech
                            openly attacking <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. His references to
                            splitting Indonesia in Bandung speech<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">See

                            mild compared to his original thinking.</p>
                        <p>I broke in at this point to assure Prime Minister that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had no such objectives, that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives with regard to Indonesia were
                            what I had <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0166"/>repeatedly told him
                            they were—a united Indonesia able to stand on its own feet and maintain
                            its own freedom and independence. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> did
                            not desire fragmentation of Indonesia which we felt would not be in
                            interest of Indonesia, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or free world.
                            We were of course most concerned about growth of communism in Java and
                            fact that no steps apparently were being taken to do anything about it.
                            Prime Minister said he, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> and others realized that something must be
                            done about it and he was glad to be able to tell me that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> in its meeting in Semarang had decided
                            to take positive steps. He said he would be conferring with Deputy Prime
                            Minister Hardi and others in next few days to work out specific positive
                            program. He also said he hoped that <persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                >Hatta</persName> could be induced to join government but that
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> did so or not, we
                            could be sure steps would be taken to curb growth of communism. At least
                            this would be case unless <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement
                            in current struggle provided <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            opportunity turn Indonesian leadership against America.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister said he had just received advice from his Indonesian
                            Embassy in Manila to effect that new preparations were being carried out
                            at Clark Field for additional plane and <gloss target="#t_MTB1"
                                >MTB</gloss> assistance to rebels.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister interjected at this point observation that Serrano had
                            said he was planning protest to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2"
                                >Bohlen</persName> against use of Clark Field to mount program of
                            assistance to rebels. He did not know whether this had yet been
                            done.</p>
                        <p>I expressed shocked surprise that Clark Field would have been directly
                            involved in operation of this kind and asked whether he had specific
                            evidence. Prime Minister replied that he had reports of observers from
                            Indonesian Embassy Manila. I indicated this was hard for me to believe
                            but I would transmit allegations to my Government.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister continued by making strong appeal for action by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government to halt bombings and further
                            aid to rebels. He hoped Secretary could say something to indicate <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intention to do what it could. This he
                            said would help immeasurably to clear air and enable those within
                            government who were endeavoring pour oil on troubled waters to continue
                            this course. Further bombings would provide Communists with such
                            leverage that it would be impossible for non-Communists and friends of
                            America to hold line.</p>
                        <p>At this point I pulled out of my pocket paraphrase of Deptel 3184 which I
                            had received shortly before leaving chancery and said I had some news
                            for them which was responsive to Foreign Minister’s earlier appeal this
                            subject. After I had finished reading substance of reftel Prime Minister
                            nodding appreciatively said that more threatening area at moment seemed
                            to be build-up at Clark Field in Manila and he hoped that something
                            could be done about this.</p>
                        <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>Prime Minister repeated very earnestly that he felt future of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian relationships depended on
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> responsiveness to his appeal. He
                            indicated America’s friendship was so important to Indonesia that he was
                            willing to overlook American past participation but he pleaded for
                            hands-off in future and let Indonesians settle their own internal
                            conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister concluded his comments by saying that he recognized this
                            was very unusual procedure for him to make appeal of this character to
                            Ambassador but that he felt he could do so on basis our personal
                            friendship and that this was perhaps only way in which matter could be
                                resolved.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">In telegram 4079 from Djakarta,

                                tendency of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to
                                follow more dictatorial methods with support of Soviet bloc. He
                                reviewed action in Sumatra and the Celebes and political situation
                                in Djakarta. He indicated that these events as well as those in

                                economic aid to back dictatorial leaders. It was a form of indirect
                                aggression which is very difficult to deal with under established
                                international law.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., Central Files,

                                >US</gloss> make more emphatic to the Indonesian government that
                            there would be no tolerance of an armed attack on West New Guinea. The
                            Foreign Minister said that he was convinced that if the Indonesian
                            government knew this in advance, there would not be any such attack.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he was not entirely sure that an attack would
                            in the long run be bad because if it took place it would expose the
                            disregard by the Indonesian government of the provisions of the <gloss

                            the permissible reaction to such an attack would be such as to give a
                            bloody nose to the Indonesian government.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said he
                            thought the Dutch could do that, that they were good fighters and the
                            Indonesians were not, as shown by the fact that a handful of the Dutch
                            had been able for many years to exercise complete control and authority
                            over the many millions of Indonesians.</p>

                        <p>Riley, <persName corresp="#p_SJM3">Steeves</persName> and I are of the
                            opinion that <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>’s
                            presentation of views to <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>
                            reported in Djakarta’s 4063 reveal that the situation is grave indeed
                            and that there is an imminent possibility of a break of relations
                            between Indonesia and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. If this should
                            transpire, the fat is really in the fire and we will have forced beyond

                            within the framework of the Djakarta government.</p>
                        <p>If Washington is convinced, as some in State seem to be, that there is
                            possibility that no real will resist communism exists the army or in any
                            other effective area in Djakarta then, of course, we have no alternative
                            but to turn a deaf ear to such pleading as <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> presents. If, however, there is any basis to the
                            recent reports that there are strong elements who are still
                            anti-Communist in Djakarta, we are of the opinion that greater risks may
                            be required in order not to turn our backs irrevocably on any possible
                            non-Communist cooperation from Djakarta. We may be asking too much of

                            critical. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was engaged in feverish
                            activity designed to push GOI into irrevocable anti-American position.
                            This information would enable <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> and himself to put shoe on other foot. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> were obviously greatly
                            relieved by indication adjustment <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister, while expressing gratification at reassurance and offer
                            of help from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, said that Indonesian
                            Government would not be willing to consider offer which carried
                            conditions with it affecting internal operations of country; that
                            Indonesia, in other words, would not bargain away its independence of
                            action. Indonesia Government would <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147"
                                facs="0173"/>follow course it believed sound for country; if that
                            course enabled <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to help, so much the
                            better. He believed that this would prove to be case.</p>
                        <p>I said I understood this thoroughly and that I was not putting forward
                            proposition with conditions but simply informing them what we would like
                            to do and were prepared to do. At same time I was indicating ways in
                            which they could be helpful to us in creating situation that would
                            enable us to do what we would like to do by satisfying <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister acknowledged distinction with smile and then proceeded to
                            say that he was planning two moves in near future: (1) reshuffle of
                            government and (2) more positive actions to curb <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>. He said he could tell me confidentially that he as
                            well as army was very much concerned about current activities of <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. With large part of effective military
                            forces now outside Java, as Minister of National Defense, he was
                            seriously concerned as to capability of forces left on Java to maintain
                            security if Communists stepped up activity as reports indicated they
                            were planning to do. He was not only thinking of coup but of disruption
                            of economy through strikes, boycotts, et cetera. Parenthetically, he
                            said that he had instructed military to crack down on any action taken
                            by Communists against foreign interests. Prior receiving reference
                            telegrams I had made representations to both Foreign Minister and Prime
                            Minister on subject <persName corresp="#p_ADN1">Aidit</persName> message
                            to me. (On this point he could assure me specifically that <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would not be permitted to take any
                            action against American property or personnel). Subject of how to handle
                            Communists and capability of military on Java would be discussed with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> at tomorrow’s
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>On subject reshuffle cabinet, Prime Minister said he still hoped to get
                                <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> into cabinet but could
                            not be sure. There were two reasons for this uncertainty:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>’s own rigidity and (2)
                            fear of some army leaders that he would favor Sumatrans to such extent
                            that control of army might actually pass to rebels. Sultan of
                            Jogjakarta, however, was certain to be included in cabinet either as
                            Minister of National Defense or Minister of Economic Affairs. New
                            cabinet would be anti-Communist in orientation and its objectives would
                            coincide with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> agreed with general
                            concept, he said, but task would not be easy with many conflicting
                            groups and interests and he counselled patience. He might not succeed
                            but he would do his best.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on arms offer, he carefully avoided direct reference to
                            settlement current conflict (probably because of sensitivity to
                            conditions expressed or implied) but touched on point obliquely by
                            saying that he could assure me that no arms from <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> would be used against dissidents.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>Prime Minister also expressed deep appreciation for decision on rice
                            which was urgently needed, as well as for message from Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> of <gloss

                            would not be used as base for aid to rebels.</p>
                        <p>I informed Prime Minister of appointment with <persName

                            concurred in suggestion I should supply him with highlights of reference
                            telegrams. He thought this would be mutually helpful. I also mentioned

                            invitations. Although it was impossible for GOI to send military

                            reasons previously reported, Prime Minister’s initial reaction to

                        <p>On May 8 at the 365th meeting of the National Security Council, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> opened his intelligence
                            briefing with an analysis of Indonesian developments:</p>
                        <p>“The Director of Central Intelligence indicated that the dissident forces
                            on Sumatra had been reduced to guerrilla activity. While the dissident
                            leaders, both military and political, had not been captured, the
                            prospects for effective guerrilla warfare were not very good. In the
                            northern Celebes, on the other hand, the dissidents had been having
                            quite a few successes since they had taken the air base at Morotai.
                            Their bombing attacks have stirred great anger and apprehension in
                            Java., Charges have been made that U.S. and Chinese Nationalist
                            personnel have taken part in these air raids. On the other hand, the
                            government seems to have no definite intelligence or information to back
                            up this charge. Incidentally, it had been reported that four Soviet
                            instructors had been killed in one of these dissident bombing
                            attacks.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> pointed out that a few feelers had been
                            extended at lower Army levels in Djakarta. The Army was the most
                            anti-Communist branch of the armed services, as the Air Force was the
                            most Communist-penetrated. <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0175"
                            />Certain Army officers had been in touch with our Military Attaché.
                            While there had been no real progress as yet in these conversations, Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> was not without some hope that they
                            would ultimately amount to something. In any event, our Ambassador was
                            pursuing the matter diligently. Meanwhile, there are increasing reports
                            of the arrival of Soviet military matériel—<gloss target="#t_MiG1"
                                >MIG</gloss>s, some transport planes, and a few light bombers. These
                            aircraft have not yet seen action, and probably wouldn’t for some days,
                            until training was completed. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> might wish
                            to make a comment at this point.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> replied that it
                            was hard to assess the true situation in Djakarta. However, it seemed
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was as
                            determined as ever to run the show as he wished, i.e., with the support
                            of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>“The President observed that if the Indonesian Army could really work
                            effectively, it could completely neutralize the Communist-inclined Air
                            Force by simply seizing the airfields.” (Memorandum of discussion by

                                in Indonesia on May 8 as part of a larger trip to the Far East for
                                the purpose of inspecting U.S. naval intelligence operations. (<hi

                            understood completely, knowing how busy he must be. However, I hoped
                            that when he saw <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral Frost</persName>
                            tomorrow morning he would not treat the Admiral’s call as a courtesy
                            call but would discuss Indonesian situation frankly with him and
                            anything else he had on his mind. I said this would be mutually
                            beneficial.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> responded that
                            he would do so. He said, “There have been serious misunderstandings
                            between United States and Indonesia.” I agreed, commenting that I hoped
                            these were in process of being cleared up.</p>
                        <p>Expressing regret but also understanding that he had been unable to send
                            observers to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> exercise, I then
                            led into invitation from <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral
                                Stump</persName> to attend or send representatives to modern weapons
                            demonstration and handed him draft of <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Admiral Stump</persName>’s letter.<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">Not

                            <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> replied that he would
                            have liked to have sent observers to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> exercise but that in present situation it was
                            impossible as he needed every competent officer. He said he sincerely
                            welcomed <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>’s
                            invitation, indicated that if timing were different he would have
                            accepted with pleasure but that he was afraid he would have to make same
                            response as to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. However, he
                            appreciated invitation and would write <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Admiral Stump</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I then referred to long standing arms request which Indonesian military
                            had with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government and outlined
                            substance of reference telegrams in less detail but otherwise as
                            presented to Foreign Minister and Prime Minister last night (Embtel
                                4112).<note n="6" xml:id="d86fn6"><ref target="#d84">Document

                            request but made no specific comment. I emphasized my government wished
                            to demonstrate its confidence in leadership Indonesian Army by this <pb
                                n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0177"/>move. Statement evoked
                            gratified nods from staff officers present and this was point at which
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> himself began to
                            unbend.</p>
                        <p>He said he wanted me to know his thinking on position of Indonesian Army
                            within democratic government structure. (General had previously been
                            described to me as officer who talks over heads of associates. This
                            characteristic was clearly evident as General pursued theme of place of
                            Indonesian military in hierarchy.) He was disciple of late General
                            Sudirman, founder of Indonesian Army and Chief of Staff during
                            revolution, he said, in his strong conviction that Indonesian Army must
                            be protector of democratic Indonesian state based upon constitution and
                            Pantjasila. Constitution was important but Pantjasila with its five
                            principles was basis of philosophy establishing republic.</p>
                        <p>He wanted me to understand this because this was reason Army would never
                            permit Communists to take over government. <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> did not agree with two points of Pantjasila and Army
                            considered all five points fundamental to Indonesian philosophy of
                            revolution. Army had fought for individual freedom as well as
                            independence of country and was determined to preserve this.</p>
                        <p>For same reasons, he was equally and unalterably opposed to Moslem state
                            which would violate principles Pantjasila. This was old-fashioned
                            concept. It might have been all right 500 years ago in period absolute
                            monarchies but not today. He knew <persName corresp="#p_NM2"
                                >Natsir</persName> intimately. They had worked together during
                            revolution but he had never been able to subscribe to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NM2">Natsir</persName>’s philosophy.</p>
                        <p>He was likewise opposed to military junta concept, he said. Indeed,
                            differences between himself and former members of his staff, such as
                            Colonel <persName>Lubis</persName>, revolved around this central point.
                            There was no difference in their attitude toward communism and he said
                            this represented basis misunderstanding on America’s part of issues
                            involved in current conflict. Colonel <persName>Lubis</persName> wanted
                            to use army as road to political power; other dissidents were merely
                            interested in “commercial aspects of Warlordism”. This was great evil in
                            Indonesian Army as it had been in Chinese Army in old days, and he was
                            determined to crush this and develop strong, vigorous, cohesive army
                            responsive to commander-in-chief with function of preservation
                            Indonesian democracy. He implied China might never have gone Communist
                            had this been true.</p>
                        <p>Position of Indonesian military was different and would continue to be
                            different from that of military in any other country in world that he
                            knew of, he said. He has repeatedly been urged to take over power and
                            establish military dictatorship. “I will not do this,” he said. “This is
                            what happens in Latin America. It must not happen in Indonesia. If I
                            seize power today someone else will seize power tomorrow and throw me
                            out. This does not make for stable democracy, which is our
                            objective”.</p>
                        <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0178"/>
                        <p>Neither, however, would Indonesian military ever accept traditional
                            position of military in European democracies and under all circumstances
                            take orders from civilian politicians. Indonesian military would
                            continue active in policy. They had fought and won revolution and
                            considered they had right to be heard in councils of nation. They did
                            not want to take over power—their objective, he repeated, was to protect
                            and preserve fruits of revolution. “It is our job to preserve freedom in
                            Indonesia,” he said, “and to prevent its curtailment from whatever
                            source. This is what Pantjasila means to us.”</p>
                        <p>To carry out this concept, Army would insist on strong emergency powers
                            being provided in constitution. They must be able to move in and take
                            over legally when threat to democratic state loomed on horizon. What he
                            seemed to be saying was that Indonesian Army would in effect be
                            policeman to constitution and guardian of Indonesian liberties and that
                            he was determined to weld it into effective instrument for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I was much impressed with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and believe
                            conversation was most useful from standpoint both sides. Better
                            assessment of results, however, can be made after discussions within
                            Cabinet are known and Indonesians follow up this approach.</p>
                        <p>Department’s prompt action relation above matter deeply appreciated. It
                            apparently was close thing. British Ambassador informed me today he was
                            waiting for <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> yesterday
                            at 1 p.m. and that Foreign Minister was delayed considerable length of
                            time in Cabinet meeting. His aide informed Ambassador, “there is
                            terrible argument going on in there”, and when Foreign Minister finally
                            emerged he confirmed this and indicated in meeting great pressure had
                            been brought to attack <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> openly as
                            aggressor. Events of last night and this morning already appear to have
                            brought great change in atmosphere.</p>

                            time. He said as soon as it had been published he received telephone
                            calls from both President and Prime Minister who were inclined to react
                            at once with strong statement attacking United States. Foreign Minister
                            pointed out this was third-hand information and urged that they wait
                            until he had opportunity to consult American Ambassador. He also told
                            them he could not believe that United States would deliberately
                            exacerbate United States-Indonesian relations after having just made
                            strong gesture in behalf friendship in Ambassador’s approach to Prime

                        <p>I informed Foreign Minister that I believed he was correct in his

                                <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0180"/>context in which it was
                            published. Indeed, as soon as I had read story, I had dictated telegram

                            response.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister pointed out that they were doing best to play down issue
                            of West New Guinea. I believe this to be accurate, particularly at this

                                be timely to take steps to expand the approach to the military

                                deterioration of the economy of the country. Indonesian economy has
                                steadily declined since the Japanese occupation. The recent
                                expulsion of the Dutch has aggravated further an already bad
                                situation. It seems obvious that, if Indonesia is to survive as an
                                independent nation, she must be assisted by the free nations of the
                                world to a position of economic stability. If she is assisted by
                                Soviet Bloc countries, Indonesia will inevitably swing into the
                                Sino-Soviet orbit.</item>

                                        should offer a moderate “impact program” of economic aid.

                                        land, sea, and air transportation equipment. The scope and
                                        promptness of this program should be at least comparable to

                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Colonel Sukendro</persName> to me to discuss some
                            items <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> did not have time
                            to cover during my visit.</p>
                        <p>First <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> wanted to tell me
                            he planned to bring about changes in Cabinet to replace leftist-oriented
                            members. Second, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> was
                            deeply concerned about economic situation result recent bombings of
                            shipping by rebels. Third, that rebel bombings had completely upset his
                            timing for taking action against Communists because he could not, and
                            would not, make any such move until rebel problem was solved. Effects of
                            bombings had greatly disturbed him and had forced him to consider
                            economic factor which he could not now control because of dependence of
                            Indonesia upon outside shipping and other trade relationships. At same
                            time, he wished me to know Communists were becoming more active in
                            exploiting economic situation. He did not give details, his only comment
                            being that I would understand how Communists would go about using this
                            new tool which had been put in their hands.</p>
                        <p>During this 2-hour discussion, <persName corresp="#p_SBG1"
                                >Sukendro</persName> again questioned sincerity of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> motives. I did not emphasize Communism or
                            anti-Communism but developed what we in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> consider to be aspiration of new republic. These items
                            included an independent Indonesia, in no way controlled by international
                            Communism or any other influence, the vital requirement for maintaining
                            the principles of the constitution of the Republic; economic control of
                            country by Indonesians and finally necessity for tying together many
                            divisive forces through their maritime communications; their navy and
                            their political representation from all regional areas.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> stated General wished to
                            ask me to convey message frankly to <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>
                            and many other government level officials with whom he knows I have
                            contact. “What can <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> do, what support
                            can I expect from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>?” he asked. It was
                            apparent that General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            has serious doubts about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> because of
                            alleged support of rebels. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Colonel
                                Sukendro</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> cannot understand why <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> would support such persons as Warouw who in 1948 during
                            Communist uprising at Madiun <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0184"
                            />was on “red side”. My only response was again to ask him to explain to
                            me and to representatives here specific facts relating to those
                            individuals on rebel side who were pursuing their own self-interests as
                            opposed to those of country, or who sought to be “war lords” in various
                            areas. This took some time as <persName corresp="#p_SBG1"
                                >Sukendro</persName> was talking to me for first time without an
                            interpreter. I told him I would again review background of all rebel
                            leaders which has been fully reported by Embassy.</p>
                        <p>In summary, General desired to advise me that we were rapidly coming to
                            “climax” in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian relations and
                            in current situation here and that he could not, and would not, hazard
                            his chances of success without knowing how he was to control <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> activities and solve developing
                            economic crisis. Everything hinged on whether or not <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would support him. To accomplish his
                            objectives, bring about political changes in Cabinet and move against
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, he must know unequivocally and
                            soon what <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government intends to
                            do.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comments</hi>: While there are many factors in this
                            complex situation, I believe <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> is only person who has strength to change trend
                            of Soviet influence. As indication his cooperativeness, he made
                            immediate arrangements (through <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and FonOff) for Subijakto to receive me this
                            morning after latter had declined all invitations both for himself and
                            for navy and having stated he was too busy to see me.</p>
                        <p>Atmosphere my call on Subijakto was barely cordial and about only item he
                            discussed was to play old record of Indonesia’s requirement for control
                            of West Irian before anything else can be done. He thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName>’s invitation to the
                            Baguio Conference for 18 May was interesting but it came at time when he
                            was too busy. There is no doubt that loss of their Corvette cuts him
                            very deeply and he would seek to attribute this loss to alleged
                            participation of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in rebel cause.</p>
                        <p>I must acknowledge that my visit here would have been a complete failure
                            without assistance of General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> who has, I believe, gone further in disclosing
                            his real position than at any time in past. I can see no other internal
                            element in Indonesia through which we may promote best interests of
                            Indonesia than Indonesian Army. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> comments follow and I am deeply grateful to him
                            and to his staff for their determined and ever helpful assistance while
                            in Djakarta.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Ambassador’s comments</hi>: I am deeply appreciative of
                                <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral Frost</persName> visit which
                            has been more helpful. It was not only a real personal pleasure to have
                            him here. <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral Frost</persName> himself
                            has made real contribution in terms of personal relations and developing
                            confidence of General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            and other important military figures that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> genuinely exploring ways and means of helping Indonesian
                            situation. His visit also has tended to allay suspicion <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Navy directly involved in aid to rebels.
                            He has accomplished much in short visit.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0185"/>
                        <p>As clear from above message, <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral
                                Frost</persName> has independently reached conclusion already
                            reached by me that General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> and army represent majority in unlocking door
                            to solution Indonesian problem. Interesting observation made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral Frost</persName> on way to
                            airport was strong impression of complete lack indication any
                            Indonesians desire to get rid of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Control of him within
                            democratic framework, not elimination, has been attitude throughout
                            conversations. <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral Frost</persName>
                            departed with feeling <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            was still symbol of independence and should be regarded by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as fact of life in this situation.</p>
                        <p>Also on way to airport, <persName corresp="#p_FRALH1">Admiral
                                Frost</persName> pithily remarked he was convinced “<persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is reason we are still in
                            ball game.” Admiral’s final observation was that as Yankee visitor in
                            Djakarta, he felt a little like a Russian must feel visiting
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions prior departure, we both shared great sense of urgency
                            in moving off dead center and giving <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> some positive tangible evidence of our
                            willingness to back him.</p>
                        <p>During visit, Indonesian Army also indicated preparedness send mission to
                            Washington or anywhere else to discuss implementation of my approach to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and set forth frankly
                            position of army in current difficult situation. Acceptance of this
                            suggestion might be way of moving ahead promptly on arms for army
                            without immediate commitment or necessity for shipment until resolution
                            conflict. However, should this suggestion be adopted, we must recognize
                            we have crossed Rubicon because such mission could not return
                            empty-handed. To avoid <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> exploitation,
                            fact of mission should be held confidential, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> stressed.</p>
                        <p>In conversation with <persName>Admiral</persName> via Lt. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Colonel Sukendro</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> also emphasized vital
                            importance keeping his plans secret. <persName>Admiral</persName> was
                            not only first foreigner but first one out of family with whom we had
                            shared his program. Even cabinet had not been taken completely into his
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>If any of this got back to Indonesians via <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> channels, this could be fatal to mutual objectives.</p>

                            military stalemate exists. This being the case it would appear that the
                            best course of action would be for cessation of military activities in
                            order to permit the anti-Communist elements in Djakarta to take the

                                    restored to the area and suggesting at the same time that both

                                    economic support. You should reiterate that a token shipment of

                                    be possible since it would appear to us that the objectives of

                                        >Nasution</persName> and the Army and other anti-Communists
                                    on Java is the same, that is, to stop the Communists in

                        <p>FYI: The Secretary will probably not have a press conference before
                                Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">May 20.</note> next week. We hope
                            it would be possible to conduct the necessary discussions in Djakarta in
                            time for a statement to be made by him at that time assuming of course
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> accepts the
                            suggestion. In view of the seriousness of the situation however we
                            believe that we should move as expeditiously as possible.</p>

                                >Nasution</persName> of your purpose. Outline of verbal statement
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy toward Indonesia proceeds from the premise that it should be
                            a vigorous independent member of the society of free nations. This
                            policy led us to give support to the desire of the Indonesians for
                            independence. Our policy in this respect has never wavered and under it
                            we have given moral, political and economic support to the Government of
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>We have, however, become deeply concerned at the growing influence and
                            ambitions of the Communist Party in Indonesia. We are convinced that
                            here as elsewhere the Communist Party is an instrument of International
                            Communism, and that it takes its direction from Moscow. The recent
                            statement by Mr. Nehru that the Communist Party in India is guided from
                            without applies equally to the Communist Party in Indonesia. The
                            influence of that party, coupled with the large degree of Indonesian
                            military dependence, both in terms of equipment and technicians on the
                            Soviet bloc, cannot but cause deep concern to all who had such high
                            hopes for Indonesia as a truly independent nation. It has been
                            demonstrated time and again, most recently by Soviet action in Hungary,
                            and by its present policy toward Yugoslavia, that it is intolerant of
                            genuine independence if it is able, directly or indirectly, to impose
                            its will.</p>
                        <p>This situation is inevitably of deep concern to peoples of the free world
                            who are in close proximity to Indonesia. This vast archipelago,
                            projecting from the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific, is
                            geographically close to many free countries, the peoples of which cannot
                            but have deep concern lest there be a militant Communist regime in their
                            very midst.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Indonesia complains that a few people from the
                            surrounding areas are as individuals helping elements within Indonesia
                            who are in rebellion against the Communist trend to which we allude. No
                            one could realistically expect that Indonesia should be moved into the
                            Sino-Soviet orbit with the total good will and acquiescence of all the
                            neighboring peoples who would be greatly endangered thereby. There is no
                            rule of international law to stop this.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government itself has exercised the greatest
                            circumspection in this matter. It is not possible for us to control the
                            activities of all Americans, some of whom are “soldiers of fortune” and
                            interested in freedom, and there is no international obligation on our
                            part to do so. If there are any, the number must be insignificant and
                            the rumors of large participation by Americans are wholly without basis
                            in fact. We have to this date ignored repeated pleas by the rebels that
                            we recognize their belligerent status.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0192"/>
                        <p>We suggest that the Indonesian Government must realistically recognize it
                            as a fact that there cannot but be at least a minimum of reaction on the
                            part of all those, Indonesians and neighbors of Indonesia, who see in
                            rising Communist influence the prospect of alien domination, so long as
                            the Central Government seems to be moving in a Communist direction.</p>
                        <p>If the Government takes definite measures for the elimination of the
                            Communist threat which would in itself greatly enhance the prospects for
                            a peaceful settlement of the present struggle, we would use full extent
                            of our influence everywhere including our influence with neighboring
                            states to try to compose the situation which now threatens to disrupt
                            the normal life of the Indonesian Republic. Furthermore, under those
                            conditions, the United States would be prepared to extend substantial
                            economic aid, and such military aid as would seem appropriate to
                            maintain internal order as against any Communist subversive threat.</p>
                        <p>The United States seeks for itself nothing whatsoever from Indonesia
                            other than that it should be a genuinely independent nation. We are
                            deeply distressed that events jeopardize that independence and impair
                            the economic prospects of Indonesia, whose people deserve an improving
                            rather than a deteriorating social and economic prospect. We would
                            eagerly welcome knowledge of any concrete measures with which the United
                            States might cooperate, if this be the wish of the Government of
                            Indonesia.</p>

                                        opinion that the Ambassador could promise such support
                                        including specific funds and specific military aid as listed
                                        in the Token Military Aid Program for Indonesia.</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> opened the
                            conversation by expressing his appreciation for the opportunity of
                            seeing the Secretary so soon after his return from the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Meeting in Copenhagen. The Ambassador
                            explained that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> had asked him to express urgently to the Secretary
                            the Dutch Government’s concern at the effect in Indonesia of the denial
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> story from Copenhagen which had
                            reported the Secretary to have said at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Meeting that an Indonesian attack on West New Guinea
                            would have most serious consequences for South-east Asia and the Western
                            Alliance. The Dutch Government feared that the Indonesian Government and
                            military would interpret this denial to mean that the United States
                            would be indifferent to such an attack. The Secretary replied that when
                            he had considered the problem of denying the <gloss target="#t_UP1"
                                >UP</gloss> story he had had very much in mind the possibility that
                            the Indonesians might place such an interpretation on the denial. He
                            had, therefore, instructed the Department that the story be denied in
                            such a fashion that the Indonesians could not draw this inference. He
                            was satisfied that this had been done. He did not believe that the
                            Indonesians were under any illusions about our position. They were aware
                            of the fact that the United States opposed the use of force for the
                            resolution of differences. In this respect he believed that the
                            situation was being handled as the Dutch would want. Whatever the
                            Indonesians may say publicly, they know that the United States would not
                            be indifferent to the use of force against West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that the possibility of an Indonesian attack on
                            New Guinea had been mentioned in the corridors at Copenhagen in a brief
                            exchange between him and Foreign Minister Luns.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d95fn1">See <ref target="#d82">Document 82</ref>.</note> The
                            Secretary <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0196"/>said that he had
                            jokingly remarked that it might perhaps be a good thing if Indonesia
                            should try to attack West New Guinea. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied perhaps so, adding in the
                            same vein that the Dutch had proved themselves good soldiers in the past
                            and the Indonesians were still far from successful in demonstrating this
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that
                            the Dutch Government, of course, understood that the United States was
                            opposed to the use of force against West New Guinea. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>, however, was going
                            before the First Chamber of the Dutch Parliament today to defend the
                            Foreign Office Budget and he expected questions based on the denial of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> story. He added that there had
                            been considerable public reaction in The Hague and speculation about the
                            possibility that the Indonesians might conclude from the denial that the
                            United States would be indifferent to an attack on West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KD5">Ketel</persName>
                            left the Secretary’s office for several minutes while the following
                            statement which the Secretary drafted was discussed: <quote

                                <p>“The Netherlands Ambassador called upon the Secretary of State to

                                    Secretary said that the United States had no reason to
                                    anticipate any such attack. The Secretary went on to affirm that
                                    the United States, as its conduct had shown, was dedicated to
                                    the principle of the United Nations Charter that situations
                                    which might lead to a breach of the peace should be settled by
                                    peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice
                                    and international law.”</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KD5">Ketel</persName>
                            rejoined the Secretary and he gave them copies of this statement. After
                            studying it the Ambassador said that in all frankness he must point out
                            that he did not believe that the statement would entirely meet Foreign
                            Minister Luns’ needs since it did not contain a specific warning to
                            Indonesia against the use of force. The Secretary replied that that was
                            quite true but that the inference could be drawn that we would not be
                            indifferent to the use of force against New Guinea. The Ambassador again
                            said that the absence of a specific warning would make Foreign Minister
                            Luns’ task in answering questions in Parliament more difficult. The
                            Secretary replied that the Dutch were in effect asking for us to change
                            our policy and issue a public warning to Indonesia. He recognized
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>’ problem
                            but he said that he would not agree to issue such a warning to Indonesia
                            when we have no reason to anticipate an attack on West New Guinea. It
                            was not good international practice to issue such a warning when there
                            was no evidence to justify it. In addition, the Secretary said that
                            Indonesian Government and military leaders know our position on this
                            question. <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0197"/>They were informed of
                            it, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked, when
                            we refused to sell them arms last November. The Secretary said that we
                            are trying to maintain a position in the area so that elements in
                            Indonesia opposed to communism can take control and unite the people of
                            Indonesia. It would be in our opinion an act of folly to inject at this
                            time the issue of Western New Guinea into the delicate Indonesian
                            situation. If this was done, the Communist versus non-Communist
                            character of the present struggle would be destroyed and the conflicting
                            forces in Indonesia united in an anti-colonial campaign. The danger of
                            increased Communist control would thereby become much greater. If the
                            Communists did gain control the threat would not only be against West
                            New Guinea but against Singapore, Philippines and Australia.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> again
                            returned to the likelihood of questions in Parliament and said that
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> would be
                            asked whether the United States was in fact indifferent to an attack on
                            West New Guinea. In reply to these questions the Ambassador asked
                            whether the Foreign Minister could say that he was convinced that the
                            United States was opposed to such an attack. The Secretary said that he
                            could not agree to the Foreign Minister’s making such a statement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would transmit the Secretary’s statement to
                            the Foreign Minister. He asked what the Secretary had in mind about
                            releasing the statement. The Secretary replied that he thought it might
                            be released immediately after this conversation by the Department’s
                            spokesman. It was agreed that in replying to press questions Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> would say that he
                            had discussed the denial of the <gloss target="#t_UP1">UP</gloss> story
                            with the Secretary and that the Department was releasing a statement.
                            The Ambassador then said that Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> had requested him to inform the
                            Secretary that neither the Foreign Minister nor Dutch sources had leaked
                            the story. The Secretary commented that because of the great Dutch
                            interest in this problem we had thought it might have been Dutch
                            sources, or press speculation on something which some Dutch source had
                            said. The leak had indeed created a very awkward situation and he
                            appreciated receiving the Foreign Minister’s assurances.<note n="2"

                        <p>The Secretary said that in light of developments in Indonesia and the
                            situation facing the dissidents it appeared that this might be the
                            psychological moment when we might be able to get the most by seeking a
                            political solution in Djakarta. General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> has made several approaches which would seem to
                            indicate that he feels he might be able to swing the government into
                            taking action against the communist threat. He has indicated, however,
                            that to do so he must first liquidate the rebels. It is necessary,
                            therefore, to find a way to have the two things, cessation of
                            hostilities and anti-communist action, move concurrently, especially
                            since <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may not be a
                            party to these approaches and there is no indication whether he will
                            associate himself with such a solution. It would appear, therefore, that
                            this is the best time to move.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we are instructing our Ambassador to see
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and to make a
                            statement along the following lines: The Indonesian Government alleges
                            that assistance is being given to the rebels; that he cannot move his
                            country to the communist camp without expecting reaction from the free
                            world and that some of the free peoples are bound to help the rebels;
                            that the only way to avoid that is to stop the trend to communism; that
                            if he takes action to stop this trend we are willing to discuss the
                            allegations with the Philippines, <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s, etc; also that if the trend shows any real
                            significance we would then be prepared to give economic and military
                            assistance but only if we were convinced by the actions of the
                            government that such would happen.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would also inform <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> of this approach to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> with the
                            thought that they might reinforce our position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that we were
                            also proposing to the government a cease-fire to give <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> time to carry out such action
                            as he <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0199"/>might contemplate against
                            the Communists. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is
                            extremely anxious for some indication of sympathy from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it is important that there be no build-up during
                            a cease-fire period if one is accepted, and that such must be a
                            condition to such a proposal. He said the Indonesians must also realize
                            that what is happening in the area is the inevitable counterpart of what
                            they are doing. They cannot expect to turn over their country to
                            communism without something being done about it by the free world.<note

                            seed sown on stony ground, but I believe clarification of GOI attitude
                            brought about thereby can be considered productive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> made clear (1) GOI was unified
                            in rejection any consideration of negotiation with rebels; (2) principal
                            leaders GOI aware dangers of Communist growth and have moved from talk
                            stage to action stage; (3) reorganization of Cabinet now imminent.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon receipt of reference telegrams, I requested appointment
                            with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and
                            was received at his home at 6:15 p.m. Foreign Minister has been ill for
                            several days so was not present. I instructed <gloss target="#t_ARMA1"
                                >ARMA</gloss> to seek appointment with <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> so that information would reach him
                            simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>I presented verbal statement outlined in Deptel 3301 almost verbatim and
                            informed <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> that I was
                            planning to see <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to
                            speak to him along same lines. I then explored with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> possibility of a cease-fire
                            along lines contained Deptel 3300. <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174"
                                facs="0200"/>Before I could complete what I had to say, almost at
                            first mention of words “cease-fire,” Prime Minister interrupted and
                            inquired what I meant by “cease-fire”. When I explained, he shook his
                            head incredulously and said, “but this would mean negotiating with the
                            rebels. This we could never accept”.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that both he and General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> had emphasized their problem of two-front fight
                            and difficulty of taking positive action against Communists within Java
                            until cessation of military action. This would seem to lead to logical
                            conclusion that less dangerous enemy should be eliminated by peaceful
                            settlement which would permit concentration effort on enemy representing
                            more serious threat to independence of nation. We were not suggesting
                            terms of settlement—that was GOI business. We were simply offering use
                            of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as voice to propose cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>I referred to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName>’s suggestion that Secretary make statement on
                            settlement of rebellion and that if GOI were willing to agree to a
                            cease-fire Secretary would be willing to take initiative in publicly
                            suggesting that both parties agree to cease-fire.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> rejected this flatly,
                            commenting that there was one thing upon which he, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, Suwirjo, head of <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, and Army were in complete
                            agreement—that was that there would be no negotiations with Indonesian
                            Army officers who had sought foreign assistance in fighting other
                            Indonesians. They were adamant on this point, he said. If GOI negotiated
                            with rebels at this stage, it would be regarded as sign of weakness and
                            blood of Indonesians shed in Sumatra would have been shed in vain, that
                            is, authority of government and Army Headquarters would not have been
                            reestablished. If they had been willing to negotiate they would have
                            negotiated earlier. They certainly would not negotiate now with Colonel
                                <persName corresp="#p_SLC1">Sumual</persName> and Colonel
                                <persName>Warouw</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We had long discussion of various aspects proposal but he was immovable.
                            Basis of his position was cease-fire must lead to negotiations, GOI
                            would not negotiate. I argued that GOI had insisted rebels in Menado had
                            no popular support. If premise correct and cease-fire obtained, then GOI
                            could simply await inevitable collapse of <persName corresp="#p_SLC1"
                                >Sumual</persName>–Warouw. <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> said if GOI accepted cease-fire and rebels did
                            not, GOI would appear weak. I countered with argument instead sign
                            weakness, moral position of GOI would be greatly strengthened
                            thereby.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out further that GOI might be risking Indonesian independence
                            in order to carry out policy of crushing rebels. Prime Minister replied
                            hotly, “Not if foreign interventionists stop supporting rebels. We can
                            handle rebels if they do not receive additional foreign assistance. If
                            rebels continue to receive additional foreign assistance then we too <pb
                                n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0201"/>shall require additional
                            foreign assistance”. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not
                            help, they would be forced to go elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>I again pointed out effect this would almost inevitably have on
                            independence of Indonesia and he said he recognized this only too
                            well.</p>
                        <p>If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not help even to extent of
                            discouraging foreign assistance and GOI were faced with necessity of
                            seeking additional aid from Soviet bloc, combination of external
                            pressures from bloc plus internal Communist pressures might conceivably
                            result in loss of independence and Communist Indonesia. He recognized
                            fate of himself and others who were opposed to Communism under those
                            circumstances but, he said, we have taken position from which we cannot
                            withdraw.</p>
                        <p>This would be great tragedy, he said, particularly since GOI was
                            beginning finally to take positive steps against Communists and adopt
                            course in line with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> thinking and was
                            not because of pressures, he emphasized, but because it was right course
                            to take and Indonesian leaders had finally awakened to fact. He
                            summarized recent moves against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>

                            ceased because of <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName>’s strong
                            views that it never should have been thwarted and that affair could have

                            to help and if we really meant what we said in my earlier statement
                            (last two paragraphs Deptel 3301), there was one thing which his
                            government needed more than anything else at present time—assurance
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would do everything in its power
                            to discourage further support to rebels from Philippines and Taiwan. He
                            referred specifically to oil and gas supply from Philippines and Borneo
                            by ship and air to Menado.</p>
                        <p>He knew, of course, he said, that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had
                            power to influence events in Pacific area from which rebel support
                            derived. Severance of rebel supply lines through <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> discouragement further aid to rebels he knew was within
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> capability if we were sincere and
                            really wanted to end conflict. If, as he believed, withdrawal of further
                            foreign support enabled GOI military forces end conflict, outcome, he
                            felt strongly would be in mutual interest <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and GOI. Should rebels reach point of being willing
                            surrender, they would, in accordance Indonesian tradition, be treated
                            generously. He thought <persName corresp="#p_SLC1">Sumual</persName>,

                                >Nasution</persName> considered rebels must be liquidated to achieve
                            his objectives and he would never consider negotiation with them. Army,
                            however, had already begun to move against Communists within present

                            for General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, <gloss
                                target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> is convinced that GOI will not accept
                            any terms involving direct or indirect negotiations with current rebel
                            regime. This is predicated on fact that GOI is now confronted with 4
                            major problems which must be settled in order listed. First, GOI and
                            army strongly believe that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could use
                            influence to eliminate or reduce outside air and other logistical
                            support to rebels as previously reported. This intervention by so-called
                            “soldiers of fortune” has upset timetable for GOI plans to solve rebel
                            problem, reorganize cabinet favorable to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>, and initiation of actions to control <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence. Also, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> states that intervention has
                            created adverse public opinion against GOI owing to failure to properly
                            explain matter or take positive action to stop this practice. Second,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> states that GOI
                            policy envisions crushing Menado rebels, probably before taking
                            effective steps toward solving latter two problems. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> strongly indicated that GOI
                            was capable of quick defeat of [garble] foreign support to rebels.
                            Otherwise, he believes this problem will be time consuming and may force
                            GOI to accept active Soviet bloc assistance. Third, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName><pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178"

                            cabinet had progressed to point which would permit early completion of
                            move. This, according to source, must be timed so as to take place
                            concurrently or after Menado rebels are defeated, to eliminate
                            possibility of unfavorable reaction from Indonesian public, rebels and

                                >Sukendro</persName> mentioned that Sultan of Djogjakarta was
                            definitely included in new cabinet. Fourth, <persName corresp="#p_SBG1"
                                >Sukendro</persName> stated that army realized <gloss

                            assistance would be in position to initiate further actions to control

                            lunching with us on May 22 and this may provide opportunity for brief
                            serious conversation. If not I shall ask him for appointment for another
                            talk at which time I can cover these points among others. I also hope
                            that in next press conference, Secretary will feel able take opportunity
                            to say something reassuring to GOI. I have strong impression events here

                            in precipitation issues. I think we can now go farther and say that this

                            pro quo. However, above appears to be essence of Indonesian

                        <p>Points 2, 4, and 5 are in consonance with <gloss target="#t_US1"

                        <p>If as appears to be case, GOI is determined not to try again to open

                                rebels set up revolutionary Government and GOI launched military
                                action. Now, however, issues have been precipitated by intervening
                                events and GOI appears to be preparing to move in parallel line
                                toward objectives originally set forth by rebels.</item>

                            <item>Time may be ripe, therefore, for reassessment of current rebel
                                objectives. If rebel goals limited to achievement original political
                                objectives, these appear to be in process realization. If, on other
                                hand, rebels now look forward to military victory with foreign
                                support and either complete takeover of GOI Government or
                                fragmentation their country, these objectives would appear neither
                                feasible nor in best <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests
                                because they appear from here almost certain to involve swing of

                            <item>If above reasoning sound, it would appear time has arrived to put
                                brakes on rebel military effort. Since rebel movement has apparently
                                exerted leverage sufficient to bring about GOI decision, it has
                                served constructive purpose but I believe this is as far as it can
                                go without pushing GOI to breaking point and alignment with Soviet

                            believe we can make substantial progress if we do certain things now
                            within present framework.</p>
                        <p>I believe we can progressively accelerate number and effectiveness of GOI
                            anti-Commie moves by adopting a policy of encouraging each anti-Commie
                            move they make. Example: Forceful anti-Commie step was taken by army at
                            our request to cancel large “anti-interventionist rally” scheduled
                            today. Rally was cancelled yesterday despite fact that almost all
                            political parties had agreed to participate and after notices were sent
                            to employers ordering them to allow employees to leave their jobs to
                            attend. Cancellation was not easy for army and demonstrated their power
                            versus politicians.</p>
                        <p>I think we should follow up by letting GOI know that we not only
                            appreciate army action but desire to show our approval in concrete form.
                            (A) We should provide political support by statement by Secretary

                        <p>By above “carrot” technique we can focus attention, particularly of army,
                            on what we are most interested in—anti-Commie action. If they are
                            rewarded after they make an effective move, it will not smack of “quid
                            pro quo” or “test rings” which are psychologically distasteful to Indos,
                            but will illustrate to them what is the key that unlocks American
                            policy. <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0208"/>I fully understand our
                            policy to date of denying any kind of support to GOI in order to build
                            up pressure for change of government. At same time I think it is now
                            necessary for us to unbend a little as suggested in this telegram. I do
                            not recommend opening dam wide because this would relieve pressure we
                            still need, but opening crack on above basis will definitely help at
                            this particular moment.</p>

                            When I had finished, he said he appreciated motives, but that cease-fire
                            would imply recognition rebel regime or at least willingness to
                            negotiate and this they would never consider.</p>

                            market place at most crowded time when people were shopping and on their
                            way to church (Ambon being Christian) and more than 100 civilians had
                            been killed. Ambonese were now violently bitter against both <gloss

                        <p>Meanwhile, he pointed out, <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was
                            hammering away on slogan—"It is war, war against foreign country.”

                            exploit.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister pleaded for some positive gesture from <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> soonest. At moment moral support more
                            than material support was required. Doubt of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> intentions was growing on all sides. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> government could not last much
                            longer under present circumstances, he said. Its policy of discussions
                            with us in attempt to obtain <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            assistance in discouraging foreign interference on side of rebels was
                            certain to be branded as failure in near future. Should this happen,
                            open attack on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would follow almost
                            inevitably and acceptance of volunteers from Soviet bloc. Conviction was
                            also growing in Djakarta, he said, that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> Government was determined to cause <persName

                            desire, but he and <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> had
                            hoped that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> pressure was not directed
                            at <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> as Prime Minister. He
                            also thought that if it were, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was
                            making grave mistake.</p>
                        <p>I assured him that this was certainly not the case. As he aware I had
                            great confidence in <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and
                            was convinced he was man of integrity and sincerity of purpose, that he
                            was known in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and that I could
                            categorically deny that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy was

                            thing we could do would be for Secretary to make statement clearly
                            indicating that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was willing to let
                            Indonesian Government handle rebellion as internal affair. Public
                            statement was urgently needed to reassure GOI that <gloss

                        <p>I think, for example, resignation of <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"

                            this possibility. <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> has
                            threatened to resign before but had been holding on, anticipating

                        <p>Let me reemphasize that there are no views that I know of in this

                            disagreement with idea that it is time for America to make strong
                            positive gesture of support for GOI. My own view is that this can best
                            come in public expression by Secretary, but it should be accompanied by
                            real effort to discourage additional support for rebels and particularly
                            bombing which has roused antagonism of even those elements sympathetic

                            neighbors of Indonesia, who see in rising Communist influence the
                            prospect of alien domination, and that the best way to avoid assistance
                            by few people in surrounding areas who may be assisting rebels is for
                            Indonesian Government to eliminate reasons for their action by taking
                            steps against internal Communist threat. (Deptel 3301)<note n="4"

                        </list>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not

                            situation. The Secretary said that our basic philosophy had been to
                            encourage the dissidents to a point where they might serve as leverage
                            on the government to reverse the trend toward communism. He said that as
                            a result of this policy many accusations have been made against the
                            United States and many untrue allegations of U.S. involvement have been
                            made by the Indonesian Government. <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                                facs="0218"/>It seemed to us now that the operations had been
                            carried to a point where they could no longer be effective without more
                            overt action on our part. Also, there have recently been feelers from
                            Djakarta implying that if we would dissociate ourselves from the
                            dissidents it might be possible for the anti-Communist elements to shift
                            the orientation of the government away from communism. It is doubtful
                            that such an approach will succeed and more likely that they are playing
                            a come-on game to put a stop to any support to the rebels. It is not a
                            question of intentional misleading on their part but rather that the
                            people in Djakarta do not have the power to do what they would like to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that we were faced with a situation where the
                            dissidents had failed and the undesirability of taking overt action was
                            so great that we did not want to proceed further along those lines at
                            this time. For that reason it was decided to give the political approach
                            a chance. Accordingly, we have within the last few days taken the
                            necessary steps to withdraw any support to the group in the Celebes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> had recommended that he make a press statement,
                            adding that he had made one yesterday. He commented also that other
                            things must be tried for a reasonable period, possibly two or three
                            months, to determine the intentions of the group in Djakarta. In the
                            meantime, however, we are going to keep certain assets on the shelf to
                            be used in case the political approach is not successful.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (5 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether any conditions would be imposed on the sale
                            of military equipment to Indonesia, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>]. The Secretary stated that no proposal
                            has as yet been submitted to him on the sale of military equipment so he
                            did not know what position we might take. The Secretary informed the
                            Ambassador that we had decided to issue some licenses for spare parts
                            but there had been no decisions as yet on military equipment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the Dutch were greatly concerned about this
                            problem also but that he did not think there was any appreciable danger
                            at this time of overt Indonesian action against West New Guinea. The
                            Indonesian Government is in a very difficult economic situation and it
                            is hard to imagine Indonesians precipitating a war on account of West
                            Guinea, which would simply provide a basis for counteraction. The
                            Secretary said that if military equipment is sold to Indonesia there
                            will be definite undertakings required of the Indonesian Government.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (6 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] wondered if the success of the Indonesian
                            military forces in mounting and carrying <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193"
                                facs="0219"/>out the campaign in Sumatra might not change the
                            picture. The Secretary commented that the operations had been far more
                            effective than he had been led to believe the Indonesians were capable
                            of, but there had been no resistance. In case of an attack on West New
                            Guinea there would of course be resistance and he thought that without
                            Soviet Bloc assistance Indonesia would not be capable of mounting any
                            such operation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether any conditions would be attached to any
                            token shipment of arms to Indonesia, [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. The Secretary said that we had
                            not as yet undertaken to make a token shipment of arms and therefore no
                            conditions had been set forth to the Indonesian Government. The
                            Secretary emphasized that we were moving gradually.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (4 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador returned again to the point of public relations and
                            inquired whether any thought had been given to how any change in policy
                            toward Indonesia might be presented to the [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] public. The Secretary
                            said that if we do anything publicly we will have to be careful how it
                            is expressed so that any statement will not offend the Indonesians and
                            at the same time will satisfy our public that what we are doing is based
                            on an expectation that the Government of Indonesia wishes to maintain
                            friendly relations with us. We are not entering into any formal
                            agreement with the Indonesian government but merely taking gradual steps
                            hoping thereby to encourage them to take definite action to reverse the
                            trend toward communism.</p>

                                >Robertson</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_JJ3"
                                >Chiang</persName> summoned me late this afternoon. Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> was present.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> referred to Indonesian
                            situation saying position of revolutionaries is deteriorating and will
                            become hopeless within one week unless substantial help is received
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>He spoke of flow of Communist assistance to Djakarta government including
                            Russian-made planes flown through Red China and Rangoon and of dire
                            consequences to free world if Indonesia is allowed to come under
                            Communist control. Taiwan and Philippines would then be exposed from
                            south and route to Australia interdicted. Position and prestige of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be gravely affected and
                            whole world situation altered in favor of Communists. Communist control
                            of Indonesia would hold us up to ridicule of Communist world and
                            facilitate their goal of world conquest.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> said if Chinese Reds attempt
                            to use Taiwan Strait area to move troops or supplies to Indonesia he
                            will immediately order his forces to attack them. In any case he is
                            considering issuance of public announcement to this effect. He is
                            prepared, he said, to intervene militarily if Chinese Reds
                            intervene.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> said he has received urgent
                            request from Indonesian revolutionaries to send men and equipment to
                            assist in recovery of Morotai.</p>
                        <p>Bringing out map, he expatiated at length on importance of Morotai to
                            control balance of struggle. He is proposing to send one regiment of
                            marines and a squadron of aircraft to assistance of revolutionaries who
                            otherwise will be defeated and men and equipment already supplied lost.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> hoped <gloss

                            Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> and I said I would of course do
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I said to President I was not very conversant with developments in
                            Indonesia and could not speak with authority. I recalled what you had
                            said to him about difficulties of giving help when you saw him on March
                                14.<note n="1" xml:id="d108fn1">A memorandum of the

                            help of some kind had been provided, but fact was revolutionaries had
                            failed to fight effectively and they therefore faced utter defeat. It
                            would be most risky for outsiders to fight their battles for <pb n="195"
                                xml:id="pg_195" facs="0221"/>them and I urged President to
                            reconsider carefully his proposal to send proposed fighting forces. I
                            read to him extract from your Tuesday press conference on subject of
                                Indonesia<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">See <ref target="#d105fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 105</ref>.</note> and said I inferred from
                            your remarks that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not intervene.
                            I also said his proposed intervention would provide Reds with pretext
                            they seek to intervene openly on side of Djakarta and surely he would
                            not want to provide them with that opportunity. I also referred to news
                            reports of dissident approaches to Djakarta for final compromise
                            settlement and asked if it would not be risky for him to proceed with
                            his proposed intervention if these reports proved to be true. President
                            replied that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would
                            not compromise with insurgents. He also scouted possibility that
                            agreement could be reached among Djakarta adherents whereby Reds could
                            be eliminated. In his view only solution is sufficient aid to
                            revolutionaries in men and equipment to defeat Djakarta. In agreeing to
                            pass his remarks on to you I intimated it to be my opinion that his
                            proposed course of action would be received with astonishment and dismay
                            in Washington.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JJ3">Chiang</persName> spoke earnestly and with
                            emotion at times. He appeared to be in dead earnest but I doubt whether
                            he will move to implement his proposals before receiving your reactions.
                            I would suggest that these be transmitted soonest for communication to
                            him. Of course any information of an encouraging nature about Indonesian
                            developments would be highly useful for diverting him from the risky
                            course he is contemplating so seriously.</p>

                            express the appreciation of his government for the agreement to sell
                            rice under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>–480 agreement, which was
                            very timely especially in view of the famine in Central Java; 3) to

                        <p>The Ambassador stated that Indonesia faces some very serious problems
                            among which are the growth of communism, inflation and communications.
                            During the last year the communists have made considerable progress not
                            because of the acceptance by the Indonesians of their ideology but
                            primarily because of their change in tactics. One of the new tactics
                            they have been using is in their approach to <persName

                            is not a communist and in 1948 suppressed the communists at Madiun, they
                            have nevertheless been approaching him. It is not a question of
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> working with the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as much as it is of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> using <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>. As an example of their method in dealing with
                            him the Ambassador cited their support for the Pantjasila, the
                            President’s concept of “Democracy of leadership” (“guided democracy”,
                            which the Ambassador said is a mis-translation), and of the West New
                            Guinea issue, which they know is dear to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s heart. The effect of communist support of the
                            West New Guinea issue has been to make the Indonesian case more
                            difficult. Nevertheless the communists have used that issue. The latest
                            example of their tactics is their position on the rebellion, which they
                            are also using to appeal to the people.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that about 10 days ago he had cabled <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> pointing out in frank terms
                            the danger of his playing with the communists, and the U.S. thinking on
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and emphasizing
                            that if <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0223"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> does not change his
                            attitude he is taking great risks not only domestically but in
                            Indonesia’s relations with the U.S. The Ambassador said he pointed out
                            to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> also that it is
                            necessary for Indonesia to maintain close friendship with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the way to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not to ridicule him, as
                            the press is inclined to do, but rather to flatter him. The Ambassador
                            added that he had told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> that the American people still love him but are
                            worried about the way he is going. He said this had made an impression
                            on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Immediately after
                            receipt of the Ambassador’s message <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> had called in <persName corresp="#p_Wilopo1"
                                >Wilopo</persName> who had gotten the impression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is changing his attitude.
                            The Ambassador commented that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s attendance at a luncheon yesterday at the
                            American Embassy in Djakarta was in itself significant and also a
                            further indication of the change in his attitude. The Ambassador
                            believes that the most important thing we can do in Indonesia at the
                            present time is to approach <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and seek to influence him. He emphasized again
                            the need to flatter him adding that in his opinion <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is changing his mood and
                            his thinking.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that as a result of the rebellion <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is emerging as a new power
                            and that he may well be the balance of power in the present situation.
                            The Ambassador said that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> is an anti-communist. He suggested that we
                            should approach <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> as well
                            as <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in an effort to
                            bring about closer relations between the two men. There are also changes
                            in the attitude of the political parties. The <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss>, which formerly worked with the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>, is now definitely anti-communist. As a result of the
                            shift in political power among the parties the picture now is the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> on one side, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1"
                                >Masjumi</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> on the other,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in the center.
                            The best way for the U.S. to proceed, therefore, would be to approach
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> to strengthen this new force
                            represented by the three parties.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that they would like to see the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> take some action which would
                            precipitate a showdown but the communists would not do that. That is
                            another reason why they have changed their tactics in handling the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> has suggested to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> a token shipment of arms of
                            approximately $7 million, which would assist <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and also help create a new
                            atmosphere by strengthening the Army. He is afraid that if nothing is
                            done to strengthen the Army there is danger of the communists taking
                            over as a result of the 1959 elections. The inflation in Indonesia is
                            also playing into the hands of the communists.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that in his opinion there was need for more
                            technical assistance, which has been very helpful to Indonesia, with
                            emphasis placed on small projects, small industries, rather than for <pb
                                n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0224"/>any large-scale economic
                            assistance. In his opinion this would also tend to stop inflation.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the long-term economic prospects are good
                            although the situation is bad now, and that they will improve as soon as
                            barter trade is stopped and the foreign exchange situation is
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing, he said that there is good prospect of improvement in the
                            political situation, but the help of the U.S. is needed; the economic
                            situation is bad now but long-term prospects are good, there is need for
                            immediate action and for that reason they were especially grateful for
                            the Secretary’s statement and the sale of rice. The Ambassador said also
                            that they were very glad to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> in Djakarta and expressed appreciation for the
                            role he was playing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked the Ambassador for his comments on the situation in
                            Indonesia. He said we have a good opinion of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> who is an able politician
                            and we don’t quarrel with his concept of “guided democracy”. In a
                            situation like that in Indonesia where the people have had to take over
                            without any training, there is need for greater centralization of
                            authority. As long as this leads toward genuine independence we do not
                            object to it but if it leads toward communism we are against it. We have
                            been concerned that because of the similarity of what we understood to
                            be the concept of “guided democracy” and what the Russians referred to
                            as the “dictatorship of the proletariat” there was a danger that people
                            might be misled and Indonesia might become more dependent on the
                            communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Indonesia in our opinion cannot be a happy,
                            prosperous country without ties with the West. It is surrounded by the
                            free world, its markets are primarily in the West, and if Indonesia goes
                            down the communist path it would be impossible to prevent economic
                            dislocation within the area.</p>

                            to assure the Ambassador that we are seeking to prevent acts from
                            neighboring countries designed in some form to help those who seem to be
                            trying to stop the drift of Indonesia toward communism. He said that we
                            cannot go on exerting this pressure, and he is not sure we will wish to
                            do so, unless something is done by the Indonesian Government to stop the
                            drift. The Secretary said he hoped, therefore, that the government would
                            take such action as is possible to curb the trend.</p>

                            would seem that if any talks were to take place it would be far more
                            profitable have them with new ministers rather than those in present

                            work with us and curb communists we would consider such visit premature.

                            appear to have lessened tension somewhat. Before we can go much further,
                            however, we must have some indication of effective action by Indonesian
                            Government against communist threat. If there were cabinet change and if
                            new cabinet composition satisfactory this would be considered step in
                            right direction. There is danger however that improvement in
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations in last few days might serve to bring about
                            relaxation in Djakarta thereby postponing action for reorganization of
                            cabinet or against communists. This would only play into hands of
                            communists. You should therefore urge that there be no let-up and that

                                corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>. Following basic philosophy which
                            guides us presently in our policy toward Indonesia is for your
                            background guidance and discreet use at times and with persons of your
                            choice. FYI. Following was dictated by the Secretary. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>We have regard and admiration for the abilities of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> well remembers his visit
                            here, and Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> recalls not only that
                            but his visit to Djakarta. The Congress and the American people
                            obtained, and retain, a very favorable impression of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, a distinct impression which is not exclusive to the
                            United States, that the Communists are taking advantage of the fact that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> feels a
                            need for greater authority at the top in the situation that confronts
                            him. The Communists are seeking to impose upon Indonesia a
                            Communist-type “dictatorship of the proletariat” which will end up by
                            taking the Indonesian Republic into the Communist camp and making
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in effect a
                            prisoner.</p>
                        <p>As pointed out, this is not a United States judgment, it is the judgment
                            of many Indonesians of high responsibility. It is also shared by the
                            free world nations which are Western Pacific neighbors of Indonesia and
                            which want to be its friends.</p>
                        <p>It is utterly unrealistic for anyone to believe that Indonesia can in
                            tranquillity wend its way into the Communist camp. Once it became <pb
                                n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0228"/>clear that that was the course,
                            the now dying embers of revolution would burst out in flames and it
                            would not be possible for the United States, even should it so desire,
                            to restrain the impulses of governments and individuals who are
                            dedicated to freedom and some of whom would feel they were imperiled by
                            the course Indonesia was taking.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the economy of Indonesia is so fragile and is so dependent
                            upon the free world and the West, that it would be impossible for long
                            to maintain a viable government and prosperous society if the economic
                            pattern were to be readjusted to dependence upon the Sino-Soviet
                            bloc.</p>
                        <p>The United States is exerting itself strongly to permit of an orderly and
                            peaceful evolution of Indonesian policy in a direction which will avoid,
                            and preclude, the danger of the Republic being captured by the
                            International Communist movement. The situation cannot, however, for
                            long stand still. We are hoping to see, concretely, the start of a new
                            trend and some action responsive to our own.</p>

                            take military action although he stressed importance of not permitting
                            Indonesia to fall to Communists and he asked <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Douglas</persName> to convey his views to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>. Neither was there any
                            reference of military action to me on part of Defense Minister <persName

                            President appeared relaxed and in good humor. Therefore Doyle’s report
                            came as a surprise to me, although I knew Chinese to be anxious and
                            preoccupied with Indonesian development.</p>
                        <p>After Doyle left my residence I got in touch with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>. He said he was
                            uninformed of any intent on part of President to resort to immediate
                            military action, adding he believed President would live up to assurance
                            not to move pending word from US. Besides President could not move
                            without consulting United States pursuant to mutual defense
                                agreement.<note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">Reference is to the mutual

                            Doyle. But he did know from talks he had yesterday with <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_YT3">Yu</persName> that President yesterday
                            morning had instructed Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT3"
                                >Yu</persName> to make plans for deployment of <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces to Indonesia and that Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT3">Yu</persName> had in turn asked
                            Deputy Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_YT3">Yu</persName> to draw
                            up such plans. Latter had come to Foreign Minister last night asking for
                            information as basis for drawing up plans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he was unable to provide
                            much helpful information and <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0230"/>he
                            expressed view preparation of plans would be prolonged and difficult
                            job. He also said he thought implementation of plans might be beyond
                            China’s capacity and had so intimated to planner <persName
                                corresp="#p_YT3">Yu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> and I agreed to meet tomorrow morning to discuss
                            situation further. I propose to urge him to see President and remind
                            latter of his pledge and of provisions of defense treaty. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> thinks it desirable I shall
                            probably see President again.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, if Department has any favorable information on Indonesian
                            developments or even expectations of such developments I would urge that
                            they be passed on to President without delay. While I find it hard to
                            believe that he will actually despatch forces as he threatens to do, he
                            is plainly deeply troubled, is apprehensive that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> will not move effectively to stop Communist takeover of
                            Indonesia and may just possibly take desperate action. Doyle and I agree
                            that his subordinates would deprecate such actions, but none dare stand
                            up and oppose him.<note n="6" xml:id="d113fn6"><persName

                                with Indonesians what we have done in last few days as indicative of
                                our attitude toward Indonesian Government; 2) express hope early
                                cessation hostilities; 3) emphasize strongly need for some effective
                                action in Djakarta in curbing the communist threat; and 4) reiterate
                                our willingness to help if action taken urging them to use their
                                influence in seeing that some action is taken. You may wish in this
                                connection to point out that Congressional and public opinion in
                                this country would not tolerate sale of military equipment unless
                                there is some change and that it is in their interest to take action

                                756D.00/5–2358) See Supplement.</note> I fortunately was able to
                            have a further lengthy discussion with Indonesian group consisting of
                            BGen Subroto, Col <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and
                            their excellent translator Maj Sunario. I conveyed to them the points
                            which were authorized for me to make to the group and in order to give
                            them assurance that this was being coordinated in Djakarta as well, I
                            pointed out that this was essentially what Amb <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> would be passing on under
                            instructions in Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>From this conversation and previous interviews with this group, my best
                            estimate is that they have been impressed with our willingness to assist
                            them in this new approach, that they are honestly determined to carry
                            out their part of the responsibility. This was illustrated by the fact
                            that they requested that their return schedule be altered so that they
                            might reach Djakarta more expeditiously in order to help guide delicate
                            reorientation of attitudes there to one of cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Delicately tried to suggest certain things which they could do to create
                            a better impression on their anti-Communist Asian neighbors and most of
                            all on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials and public opinion.
                            Of course the first point that we have always emphasized is that in some
                            manner they must take steps to prove that they are making genuine effort
                            to exclude <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> and Communists from
                            government influence. I further pointed out that if it is humanly
                            possible they must see to it that a muzzle is placed on <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to avoid upsetting the
                            applecart during this delicate period. Thirdly while we did not name
                            names or appear to have too much vested interest in the dissidents, we
                            did point out that insofar as possible their willingness to demonstrate
                            generosity (using the illustration of Magsaysay’s<note n="2"

                            influencing international opinion with respect to their sincerity. They
                            seemed to accept all of this philosophy with very good grace, and I
                            believe our association with them here will contribute a great deal to
                            the overall effort being made to getting our relationships back on the
                            track with the right forces in Indonesia.</p>

                            Incidentally, I believe Gen Arellano’s personal influence on them has
                            been good and trip to Manila in his personal company is fortuitous.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> came in to
                            see the Secretary at his own request. On instruction of his Government,
                            the Ambassador strongly protested the lack of prior consultation with
                            the Dutch Government and with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            concerning recent United States approval of export licenses for the
                            purchase of small arms and aircraft spare parts by Indonesia, reports of
                            which had appeared in the press on May 22. The Ambassador characterized
                            these transactions as “arms deliveries to Indonesia”. He recapitulated a
                            series of conversations which he and the Dutch Foreign Minister had had
                            with the Secretary and other officials of the Department <pb n="207"
                                xml:id="pg_207" facs="0233"/>during the course of which he asserted
                            the Dutch had received assurances that such deliveries would not be made
                            to Indonesia and that the Dutch Government would be informed of any
                            change in United States policy towards Indonesia, particularly in the
                            fields of military and economic assistance. The Ambassador stated that
                            without consultation or even an informal exchange of views the United
                            States Government had acceded to Indonesian requests for military and
                            economic (the substitution of rice for cotton under the 1956 P.L. 480
                            Agreement) assistance. He emphasized that the Dutch Government was
                            sorely disappointed by these developments; its confidence in “promises
                            given by the American Government had been severely shocked” and
                            consequently it will be compelled to draw its own conclusions. He said
                            further that there was no assurance whatsoever that the Indonesian armed
                            forces would not receive additional United States support. In view of
                            this situation and in view of Soviet bloc military assistance to
                            Indonesia the Netherlands Government would have to consider seriously
                            “adapting the defense forces of Netherlands New Guinea to this new
                            threat”. Such a move on the part of the Dutch Government, he continued,
                            would necessarily have effects on Dutch contribution to the defense of
                            Western Europe. The Dutch Government considered it necessary, therefore,
                            to inform the other members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> of
                            these developments so that they could take fully into account the
                            changed situation. The Ambassador handed the Secretary a note covering
                            these statements, the text of which is attached.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d115fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that if he had understood the Ambassador correctly
                            it would appear that the Ambassador was saying that the Dutch Government
                            no longer had any confidence in the United States Government because of
                            what the Dutch read in the newspapers. He said that this was an extreme
                            and unjustified conclusion for the Dutch Government to reach. Why, he
                            asked, had not the Dutch Government inquired about the facts? The
                            Ambassador referred to a talk which Baron van Voorst had had with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">J. Graham Parsons</persName> (<gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>) on May 22, and asserted that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> had not been
                            responsive to Baron van Voorst’s request for information on this
                                subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">A memorandum of this
                                conversation is in Department of State, Central Files,
                                756D.56/5–2258.</note> The Dutch Government, therefore, had been
                            impelled to give great weight to the press reports. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that he had
                            complete confidence in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1"
                                >Parsons</persName> and that he was certain that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> had been correct and helpful in
                            his conversation with Baron van Voorst. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> added that in his experience it was unusual to
                            raise questions of this nature during the course of a talk which had
                            been arranged as a courtesy call.</p>
                        <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0234"/>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to his conversation with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> on April 24<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d115fn3">See <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note>
                            and recalled that he had told the Foreign Minister at that time that the
                            United States was considering supplying the Indonesians with a few
                            things (some rice had been specifically mentioned) in an attempt to
                            maintain some influence in Indonesia by giving the Indonesian leaders
                            the idea that they could play both sides. The Secretary said that he did
                            not consider that the approval of export licenses for a very limited
                            list of items constituted arms deliveries to Indonesia. He explained
                            that the only arms covered by these licenses were 250 Colt revolvers for
                            the Indonesian Navy, four sporting rifles and three 22-caliber pistols.
                            The value of these items was $14,582. The total sum involved amounted to
                            approximately $1.2 million. Of the items covered by the licenses 95%
                            were aircraft spare parts. All involved commercial purchases from
                            private American companies. It had not occurred to the Department that
                            the Dutch would consider these transactions as arms deliveries to
                            Indonesia. The Secretary said he could now see that we had been wrong in
                            not informing the Dutch Government and he regretted that we had not done
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that
                            the Dutch Government not only felt very strongly about the lack of
                            consultation but that it was completely in the dark concerning the
                            reasons for United States assistance to Indonesia at this time. The
                            Secretary explained again as he had done on May 13 in his conversation
                            with the Ambassador<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">See <ref target="#d95"
                                    >Document 95</ref>.</note> that the United States was attempting
                            to create a situation in Djakarta which would permit the United States
                            to continue to exercise some influence in the swiftly moving and very
                            delicate Indonesian developments. We hoped to use this influence to
                            encourage the Indonesian civil and military leaders to institute
                            government reorganization and other steps favorable to the Free World.
                            We were pursuing these objectives in the interest of the Free World. He
                            noted with regret that we seemed to receive only sniping and a complete
                            lack of understanding from the Dutch.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then commented that he also placed a high value on
                            consultation but he did not consider that consultation was a substitute
                            for confidence. He believed that in this case the ally which had the
                            primary responsibility in a very difficult situation was due a modicum
                            of confidence and a certain degree of flexibility of action.
                            Over-emphasis on consultation could result in a web so entangling that
                            the consequences would be only more consultation and no action.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked why the Dutch Government had not been informed
                            concerning the moves which the United States had decided <pb n="209"
                                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0235"/>to take in Djakarta. The Secretary
                            replied that the emotional involvement of the Dutch in the Indonesian
                            situation was so great that he had judged it unwise to keep them as
                            closely informed as he would have liked. He emphasized this point by
                            saying that he was taking a calculated risk in talking as frankly to the
                            Ambassador as he was doing today. He stressed the confidential nature of
                            his remarks and said that any public disclosure would have disastrous
                            consequences. The Secretary again described the insignificant character
                            of the actions which the United States had decided to try in Indonesia.
                            These, he said, were in effect tactical moves designed to let the
                            Indonesian leaders think that they had an alternative to Soviet
                            assistance. Should these actions have the results which we all desired
                            of encouraging the anti-Communist elements in Indonesia and reversing
                            the leftward movement there, which he personally thought very doubtful,
                            the United States would be disposed to consider further steps designed
                            to strengthen this trend. The exact nature of these steps could not be
                            anticipated. However, our actions would be geared to concrete moves
                            which the Indonesian Government might take to reverse the current
                            Communist orientation. The Ambassador asked whether he should take the
                            Secretary’s statement to imply that if this reversal takes place the
                            United States would be prepared to consider furnishing additional
                            military assistance to Indonesia. The Secretary replied that he
                            questioned the Ambassador’s use of the word “additional” and repeated
                            that we did not consider the export licenses in question as constituting
                            deliveries of military assistance to Indonesia. He said, however, as he
                            had done to the Ambassador on May 13, that if we were satisfied with
                            steps being taken to reverse the anti-Communist trend the possibility
                            should not be excluded that we would be prepared to consider the
                            desirability of furnishing arms and military assistance to Indonesia
                            under certain circumstances.</p>
                        <p>In response to a statement of the Ambassador about the concern of the
                            Dutch Government for the security of West New Guinea, the Secretary said
                            that he would like to repeat that the Dutch Government need have no
                            concern now or in the future about the United States attitude towards an
                            Indonesian military attack on West New Guinea. He said that the Dutch
                            Government knew officially that the United States would be greatly
                            concerned about such an attack. He added that we had recently received a
                            new declaration from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> that Indonesia had no intention of using force
                            against West New Guinea. He said this declaration had been responsive to
                            a statement by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>
                            in Djakarta that good relations between the United States and Indonesia
                            would have to exclude the use of force against West New Guinea. The
                            Secretary said he remained strongly opposed to a public statement to
                            this effect which in his considered judgment would make impossible the
                            achievement of the desired orientation of the Indonesian <pb n="210"
                                xml:id="pg_210" facs="0236"/>Government. Unless we are successful in
                            bringing about such an orientation Free World Nations will not be able
                            to influence developments there.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> introduced
                            at this point the Dutch Government’s strong feeling that aid to
                            Indonesia should be contingent upon a satisfactory settlement of
                            Dutch-Indonesian problems. He said that the observance of international
                            obligations which such a settlement would imply was in the interest of
                            the entire Free World. The Secretary said that the United States also
                            placed great weight on the sanctity of international obligations, but
                            that in this case, as in the case of Iran which the Ambassador had
                            raised, it was necessary first to have a government amenable to Western
                            influence and willing to carry out its obligations. Without such a
                            government it was clearly impossible to expect observance of
                            international obligations and commitments. The Secretary then said that
                            the United States and the Netherlands should face squarely the fact that
                            in our relations with Indonesia we placed emphasis on different things.
                            The United States placed primary emphasis on preventing a Communist
                            take-over of Indonesia, whereas the Dutch appeared to place primary
                            interest on their economic and business interests in that area. The
                            United States would not like to be identified with the idea that
                            commercial interests are primary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished again to confirm to the Ambassador that we
                            had no intention at the present of furnishing arms or military equipment
                            to Indonesia. He said he was prepared to consider how we might make

                        <p>In explaining the background of current United States efforts to
                            encourage and influence Indonesian military and civil leaders to take
                            steps to reverse the Communist orientation of Indonesia, the Secretary
                            said that we had first tried to encourage the rebel movements in Sumatra
                            and then in the Celebes. He commented that our efforts would make an
                            epic story. Unfortunately, these rebel movements had apparently spent
                            themselves. Arms supplied to the rebels had fallen into the hands of
                            Indonesian Government forces, lives had been lost and the Indonesian
                            Government, in fact, now holds an American. [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>When the movement in the Celebes appeared to be following a pattern
                            similar to that of the Sumatran rebellion it was decided that the moment
                            had come when we should try to influence Indonesian military and civil
                            leaders. We consulted with Australia and the United Kingdom and it was
                            agreed that we should try this line. Our three Ambassadors in Djakarta
                            believe that there is a chance of success. Others, with whom the
                            Secretary associated himself, think that success is very unlikely.
                            Nevertheless, all concurred that this line should be tried. We have,
                            therefore, decided to make some small gestures towards the Indonesian
                            Government. We shall delay anything substantial until that government
                            takes advantage of the opportunity to perform on its side. For example,
                            if there should be a cabinet reshuffle within the next few weeks, we
                            might have some basis for judging whether steps have been taken to
                            reverse the present communist orientation.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, we shall try to keep other assets in being, with the
                            idea of possibly reviving them if the efforts in Djakarta fail. In other
                                <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0238"/>words, we shall try to keep
                            those embers warm so that they can be fanned into flames if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>If all these things do not work, it may be necessary to consider taking
                            more overt action, possibly involving the assistance of the Philippines
                            and Taiwan. In view of the extreme gravity of such a course of action,
                            it was decided first to try to influence Djakarta.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed in the strongest terms the top secret character
                            of this information. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> reinforced the Secretary’s statements by
                            explaining how closely this information was being held in this
                            Government. Both the Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> stressed that any disclosure of what the
                            Secretary had told the Ambassador would be disastrous not only for the
                            United States but for the Free World in Asia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said he understood what was
                            involved and said his government would guard the information with the
                            greatest care.<note n="1" xml:id="d116fn1">The Department summarized

                            Corps, and four paratroops. He said these mobile units would be needed
                            to move rapidly to counter Communist reaction as the GOI applied
                            pressure. He said the technical assistance should be both formal
                            instruction and technical maintenance to support the initial arming with
                            these weapons and the amount of this technical assistance would depend
                            upon the type and amount of the weapons.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> further stated following:

                        <p>Comment by attachés Cole and Shuman: We believe the Indonesian group

                            planning but rather a general stocktaking of our military and other
                            resources and seeing how we could move rapidly if and as required. He

                            asked me to call at his home at 8:15 to inform me that rebel B–26 had
                            strafed Gorontalo Sunday morning at 9 o”clock.</p>
                        <p>Since all useable airfields in Menado and vicinity are now under GOI
                            control, including Morotai, only airport from which plane could have
                            come, Foreign Minister said, was Sanga Sanga in Philippines. Foreign
                            Minister said Indonesian air force wanted to follow plane and destroy it
                            but Foreign Minister and Prime Minister prevented, not wishing to become
                            involved in international incident in last stage of military effort.
                            Foreign Minister said obvious reason for strafing instead of bombing was
                            that plane could not travel distance from Sanga Sanga to Gorontalo and
                            return with bomb load.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister requested that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Government make further representations to Government of Philippines
                            along lines of previous efforts to discourage further aid to rebels. He
                            said GOI knew that Colonel Warouw middle of May had visited both Taiwan
                            and Korea in effort to obtain additional B–26’s and B–17’s. GOI had
                            assumed this mission was unsuccessful in view of developments since then
                            but Sunday strafing has caused considerable concern. At this stage it
                            would seem in interest of all concerned to end conflict as soon as
                            possible at least to keep conflict within framework of Indonesian
                            internal problem. Foreign Minister said he had already instructed his
                            Ambassador in Manila to approach Philippine Government in effort to
                            discourage further use of Sanga Sanga by rebels.</p>
                        <p>Menado military campaign was progressing most favorably, he reported.
                            Government troops were approaching Menado from three sides and were now
                            within 40 kilometers of city.<note n="1" xml:id="d122fn1"><p>In telegram

                        <p>Recent reports from Embassy Djakarta indicate that a number of Indonesian
                            leaders are considering plans to halt the progress of the Indonesian
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). Among these
                            leaders are the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army, <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>; national and
                            regional leaders of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>) and the two major Muslim parties.</p>
                        <p>Proposed courses of action include a reshuffle of the present cabinet, a
                            moratorium on political activity, a postponement of general elections
                            for another five years, and a major economic development program to
                            raise living standards and lessen the attraction of <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> promises. However, none of these
                            leaders has prepared a well-defined anti-communist program. The extent
                            to which they represent the Army, the cabinet, and major non-Communist
                            political parties is not clear. While General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> probably speaks for his
                            immediate circle in Army headquarters, recent reports indicate that a
                            number of senior Army officers oppose his action in seeking American
                            support against the Communists. Proposals for a cabinet reshuffle have
                            not advanced beyond a nebulous stage. Various other suggested actions
                            against the Communists apparently have not been cleared by the cabinet
                            or by President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. It
                            cannot yet be taken for granted that the major non-Communist political
                            parties are able or willing to commit their membership to an effective
                            anti-Communist program.</p>

                                >PKI</gloss>: prohibiting <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> action
                            against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-owned property, limiting
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> exploitation of the celebration
                            of May Day, prohibiting a mass rally against “foreign intervention” in
                            the Indonesian rebellion, and statements by the <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                                >PNI</gloss> identifying the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as
                            the servant of a foreign power. However, close analysis indicates these
                            actions are of little substance in themselves. The prohibitions of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> action against <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> property and of the mass rally may have
                            been intended to prevent further deterioration in relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. The regulations on the
                            celebration of May Day were merely a repetition of similar regulations
                            issued in 1957. The <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> statements were
                            similar to statements issued by the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>
                            in 1951, 1954, and 1957. In any case, the power position of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has not been disturbed by these
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>No rumored central government action against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> holds out much hope of successfully blocking the
                            Communists. While a cabinet reshuffle may take place their replacements
                            will probably not impart a clearly anti-Communist flavor to the cabinet.
                            Postponement of the 1959 general elections will be increasingly
                            difficult, as preparations are already well-advanced, and this would be
                            a clearly anti-democratic act which both <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and the political leaders would probably find
                            distasteful. A major economic development program to raise living
                            standards would be a long-term project which Indonesia could hardly
                            carry out with its limited resources. Domestic policies followed by the
                            central government have effectively discouraged most private foreign
                            investment, and Western government loans have been inhibited by the
                            prospect of further Communist advances.</p>
                        <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>None of the foregoing courses of action, singly, would solve the
                            Communist problem, and the prospects of the government’s taking all of
                            them together are remote. A possible solution was recently suggested to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> by a group of
                            Moslem political leaders: the Communists could only be halted through
                            satisfactory solution of the status of Western New Guinea and low living
                            standards. They urged that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            contribute to a solution of these problems. From all indications
                            successful resolution of the Western New Guinea question might be a
                            sufficient price for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName>’s cooperation in a campaign against the Communists.
                            Improvement of the very low standard of living in Indonesia would in the
                            long run tell significantly against the Communists, much of whose
                            electoral support probably represents a protest vote against
                            poverty.</p>

                            some time today. He summarized actions to be taken as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Sultan of Djogjakarta would replace Sunardjo as Minister of

                                    would remain in Cabinet as Ministers without Portfolio.</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>I pointed out that these changes in Cabinet were hardly sufficient to
                            convince objective outsider that Indonesian Government was in fact
                            taking steps to solve problem of Communism within Indonesia and said
                            frankly that I was disappointed in result. Elimination of Hanafi had
                            become a kind of symbol of genuineness of Indonesian determination to
                            move against Commies. As long as he was in Cabinet American public would
                            hardly consider Cabinet to be effectively anti-Communist.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister explained that pressures had been very great but that
                            army was still determined to get rid of Hanafi and he thought this would
                            come as a second step in two or three months. However, strength of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> was so great that with troops
                            still in Sumatra and Sulawesi <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> had decided open challenge to Communists at this
                            time was too dangerous. He pointed out that Hanafi would have no power
                            in this Cabinet which actually had been and would continue to be run by
                            an inner steering group and since he had no govt Department to supervise
                            his claws had been rather effectively clipped. He also emphasized that
                            new Cabinet actually represented move in right direction even though not
                            as satisfactory from our standpoint as he had originally hoped and
                            indeed been led to believe by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s assurances of several weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>I recalled statements I had made to him and Prime Minister in connection
                            with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> readiness provide military and
                            economic support in accordance paragraph 4 Deptel 3300<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d124fn1"><ref target="#d92">Document 92</ref>.</note> and
                            emphasized that this did not give us much to go on. We had hoped that
                            Cabinet reshuffle would be more meaningful and that, as he knew, we were
                            prepared to send token shipment of arms just as soon as rebellion over
                            if effective action is taken against the Communists. I cautioned
                            reaction of Washington to new Cabinet might well be so negative as to
                            render such token shipment difficult if not impossible at this time.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister said he understood this but that number of unfortunate
                            events had occurred which tended influence <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> not to move too far at this
                            time. There was first most unfortunate Hensley story which had aroused
                            President and made him suspicious. There were other recent events with
                            which we both familiar (presumably he was referring to Pope case and
                            repercussions therefrom). Much though he regretted pace could not be
                            faster, what was done was in accordance with realities of Indonesian
                            politics and he urged that I not be discouraged since, while result
                            might take longer to achieve, outcome would ultimately be the same.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I felt it wise to be negative in my

                            indicated in above summary. The fact that any action at all has been
                            taken at this time should be encouraging to us, especially in light of

                            While meaning and importance of Hanafi retention remains to be seen,
                            elimination of his ministry could be distinctly helpful development

                                    <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> reported on a
                                conversation he had that morning with Moekarto, during which
                                Moekarto informed him that the reason for the Indonesian
                                Government’s postponement of the announcement of changes in the
                                cabinet was the Sultan of Djogjakarta’s decision that he would not
                                join the cabinet under present conditions. (<hi rend="italic"

                            Embassy residence last night Ambassador Moekarto informed Director USOM
                            Baird and me in effect that ball was now in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> court and future <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-Indonesian relations would depend on how we played it. He
                            admitted Cabinet change did not go as far as he would have liked—he had
                            argued for complete elimination Hanafi—but it was step in right
                            direction and considering political, economic and military situation, he
                            believed, as he had indicated to me earlier in day and reported reftel,
                            this was best that could be done. He repeated that situation was much
                            more complex than had been apparent to him from Washington. He was
                            amazed at variety, scope and intensity of Communist activity and at
                            campaign they are conducting to discredit him. He was also dismayed at
                            attitude of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister—they have stated to him
                            frankly that the policy towards <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has
                            failed despite fact that they have followed his advice step by step.</p>
                        <p>Asked if GOI had actually followed his advice, he replied, “Yes, in every
                            detail.” Source close to President had also told him that President
                            shared these views as to failure of policy and also of Moekarto
                            effectively to represent his country in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>. He has attempted to explain realities of political
                            attitudes of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> towards Indonesia and
                            necessity of Indonesia to make more definite moves against Communists.
                            He was surprised to find that not only officials of government but
                                <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> leaders as well are firmly
                            convinced that they have made such moves, yet <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> has not recognized them and has not reciprocated. That,
                            he says, has created an apparent stalemate which must be broken if free
                            momentum of improvement of relationships between the two countries is to
                            be sustained.</p>
                        <p>He was surprised to find that <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName>, who has always been considered an American
                            stooge by Indonesians, he said, is so negative towards <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in his present thinking. Apparently
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> feels he is being <pb

                            understanding or appreciation of significance of anti-Communist moves
                            that have taken place.</p>
                        <p>Moekarto said that Indonesian military within coming year are going to
                            equip themselves with modern arms and they want them from <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. However, they will not wait any longer
                            and will turn to Russia if <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> fails to
                            act. Moekarto expressed great distress at this possibility and indicated
                            his awareness of Soviet penetration and increasing influence Indonesia
                            under these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Moekarto said he had failed to understand <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> position as he felt that not only American press but
                            Congress was much more understanding and sympathetic towards Indonesia
                            than State Department. He felt informed public opinion in <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would support bolder moves in extending
                            assistance to Indonesia in her current struggle against economic
                            disruption and Communist infiltration.</p>
                        <p>He brought up subject of construction military barracks from counterpart
                            funds and said he had discussed this at some length with Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>. He felt this
                            gesture would be much appreciated by military and had impression that
                            action of this kind would strengthen his position against criticism now
                            being directed against him. He is preparing list of Export-Import Bank

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> discussed
                            Indonesian developments during his intelligence briefing. The following

                                    continue in the Celebes as it is still continuing; in Sumatra.
                                    The rebels have warned that unless we provide them with
                                    assistance they will undertake reprisals against U.S. oil
                                    installations on Sumatra, as they have already been attacking
                                    British and Dutch installations. They argue that to deprive the
                                    Central Government of oil revenues may be the only way to bring
                                    the Djakarta Government to its knees.</p>
                                <p>The President commented that it was queer that the Indonesian

                                    organized fighting is over, they begin to show greater
                                    forcefulness. Was it their object to induce the United States to

                                    in the composition of the Djakarta Cabinet was so minor in
                                    character as not to constitute a significant change. The Sultan
                                    of Djogjakarta had been asked to join the new Cabinet, but
                                    declined to do so. Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> asked
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> whether
                                    he was certain that the Sultan had been requested to join the

                                    said he was quite sure that this had been the case. Meanwhile,

                        <p>3901. For the Ambassador from the Secretary. Indonesian leaders have
                            repeatedly told you that they would not be able to conduct military
                            campaign and take action against Communist threat simultaneously but
                            that upon conclusion military campaign definite action against
                            Communists would be taken. We assume therefore that since Army has
                            announced Menado has fallen and since military campaign now concluded
                            something will be done going beyond the insignificant Cabinet reshuffle
                            announced June 25.</p>
                        <p>Governments of neighboring countries have been repeatedly expressing to
                            us their concern at growing influence and ambitions Communist Party and
                            increasing activities Sino-Soviet bloc in Indonesia. They feel this
                            endangers them. We believe we should let <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> know of this concern on part neighboring
                            countries and seek determine from him nature his plans now that military
                            campaign over and obtain from him assurances on which we might rely in
                            defining our attitude.</p>
                        <p>You should therefore seek appointment with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> soon as possible and speak
                            along following lines.</p>
                        <p>Some governments in Far East have recently approached <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government and expressed grave concern at
                            growing strength and influence of Communist Party in Indonesia and at
                            increased activities Sino-Soviet bloc in area. They fear that with
                            successful conclusion of military campaign against rebels the Communist
                            threat might increase thereby jeopardizing their own security and
                            independence and ultimately that of the entire area. This concern on
                            their part appears to us to be genuine and justifiable unless the
                            government of Indonesia is prepared in fact to arrest the growth of
                            influence of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> which seeks bring
                            Indonesia’s political and military structures more and more under the
                            domination of International Communism which will then in turn seek to
                            subvert neighboring countries.</p>
                        <p>We would like to be able to indicate to these governments that we have
                            confidence that the Indonesian authorities will take the necessary
                            internal measures to check the growth of Communist power and thus to
                            prevent Indonesia from being moved into the Communist camp and
                            effectively losing its independence.</p>
                        <p>It must be clear to all who study international affairs that <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> is an instrument of Sino-Soviet
                            imperialism and that it takes its direction <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233"
                                facs="0259"/>from leaders of Sino-Soviet bloc and their Communist
                            parties. Recent statements by Nehru that Communist Party in India is
                            guided from without applies equally to <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> and every other Communist Party that follows the
                            International Communist line. It has been demonstrated time and again,
                            most recently by Soviet action in Hungary and by its present policy
                            toward Yugoslavia, that International Communism is intolerant of genuine
                            independence. The President should realistically recognize it as a fact
                            that there cannot but be some reaction on the part of those, Indonesians
                            and neighbors of Indonesia, who see in rising Communist influence
                            prospect of alien domination. They are not, in fact, going to be
                            placidly acquiescent in that.</p>
                        <p>The President should know that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy
                            proceeds from the premise that Indonesia should be a vigorous
                            independent member of society of free nations. We assume that this is
                            also the President’s desire. Our policy led us to give support to the
                            desire of Indonesia for independence in the postwar period. Our policy
                            in this respect has never wavered and under it we have given moral,
                            political and economic support to government of Indonesia so long as we
                            could feel confident that such support was helping Indonesia to be
                            independent. In further implementation of this policy <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government would be prepared, if the
                            government of Indonesia takes definite measures toward eliminating
                            Communist threat, to extend additional substantial economic aid and such
                            military aid as would seem appropriate to maintain internal order as
                            against any Communist subversive threat.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> seeks for itself nothing whatsoever
                            from Indonesia other than that it should be genuinely independent
                            nation. We are sure this is also the desire of the other countries in
                            the area. We would therefore welcome knowledge of concrete measures
                            which the Indonesian Government contemplates taking and also an
                            indication of what the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might do to
                            assist Indonesia in maintaining its freedom and independence. This would
                            put us in a position to enable us to reassure Indonesia’s neighbors who
                            bring to us their concern which we also share.</p>
                        <p>We are not seeking to align Indonesia with <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> as occasionally charged. We fully respect the
                            decision of any government to avoid international alignments, even
                            though we ourselves believe that collective security is the best
                            security. History of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations with
                            Indonesia, as well as with India, Burma and Afghanistan bear ample
                            testimony on sincerity this policy.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> itself has no objective other
                            than mutual defense. It is not and cannot become an instrument of

                            that while the Government has dealt with the overt and organized aspects
                            of the rebellion it cannot, without moving away from Communism, deal
                            with the economic or underground aspects of the problem.</p>
                        <p>The rebels have not been exterminated to any appreciable extent. They
                            have been driven underground where they remain as embers which could
                            flare up to keep the economy and the solvency of the nation in a
                            precarious state. The economic prospect is indeed bleak unless the GOI
                            can assure good long-term relations with the free world nations which
                            regard Communism as their enemy. The Soviet bloc has ample surplus
                            military equipment. But it cannot provide the markets which Indonesia
                            requires for its natural products nor can it provide the agricultural
                            products which the West, notably the United States, possesses in
                            surplus, but which are in very short supply in the Soviet Union and
                            China. The Communist leaders in Indonesia, probably taking orders from
                            outside, may, like International Communists everywhere, be indifferent
                            to human misery if it gives them opportunity, and they may feel that it
                            is to their political advantage to invite economic and fiscal chaos on
                            the theory that where such chaos exists they can increase their
                            political power. But surely this is not in the interest of the people or
                            Government of Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>With regard to Indonesia, the Secretary noted that there had been a
                            spontaneous revolt, particularly in Sumatra and the Celebes, against
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s trend toward
                            Communism. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] In view of the arms they had received, the rebels
                            in Sumatra could have made a serious stand, but unfortunately they did
                            not do so. They had since withdrawn to the jungle, but had not as yet
                            given up. In the Celebes the rebels had shown more will to fight and
                            this was partly due to outside air support. In Sumatra the Indonesian
                            Government had had complete control of the air, which had had a
                            demoralizing effect.</p>
                        <p>Some six weeks ago, the Secretary said, we had concluded that the rebels
                            were going to collapse unless they received overt assistance. We
                            accordingly decided to see if, before the embers of the rebellion became
                            completely cold, we could not get the Indonesian Government to move away
                            from the Communist camp. We were then told that <persName

                            This was in fact done, but the new cabinet had reflected no basic change
                            in orientation. As a result, we had given our Ambassador instructions to
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that unless he
                            took positive <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0263"/>steps away from
                            Communism, it would not be possible to prevent the neighboring countries
                            from rendering assistance to the rebels. In the Philippines, Taiwan and
                            Korea, there was great concern over developments in Indonesia and
                            accordingly a desire to help the rebels. The situation might therefore
                            come to a head very soon: either <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> would come around or increased rebel activity
                            would be permitted. It must be recognized, the Secretary stated, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was extremely
                            adroit and was getting considerable matériel of a military nature from
                            the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>In response to the French Foreign Minister’s request for the Secretary’s
                            over-all estimate of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            the Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was like <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> in many respects. He undoubtedly wished to be
                            independent. However, he thought that he could accept Communist aid and
                            still remain independent. In fact he was becoming more and more
                            dependent on the Soviets. Of course, it must be noted, the Secretary
                            stated, that there was a very large and effective Communist party in
                            Indonesia. The economic conditions of the country were deplorable and
                            the Communists thrived on this situation. If elections were held today,
                            the Secretary said, the Communist party would undoubtedly receive more
                            votes than they had obtained the last time.</p>

                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. In absence of Foreign Minister who
                            is on 4-day leave, Secretary General Suwito summoned me at 9 o’clock
                            this morning to inform me that 4-engine bomber at 12:55 local time July
                            6 had flown over Donggala in north central Sulawesi (west coast) from
                            west to east and dropped oil drums on roofs of houses in small village
                            of Wani. Latter is located between Taiwaeli and Laeba (map coordinates
                            0039 south 11949 east). Amount of damage still under investigation.</p>
                        <p>When I pressed him for details he said he had none but would supply them
                            as soon as obtained. I expressed amazement because I could <pb n="238"
                                xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>not conceive what could be purpose of
                            such raid. Suwito said GOI did not know, but in strictest confidence he
                            would tell me that Major Samba was hiding in village of Donggala or
                            vicinity and that GOI speculation was that drums were to supply oil and
                            gas for rescue plane.</p>
                        <p>What distressed Indonesian Government was that this represented
                            continuance of outside interference. Prime Minister, he said, was very
                            much upset this morning because there was no place in Indonesia not
                            under control of GOI forces from which 4-engine plane could operate.
                            This meant plane was either based in Taiwan or Philippines but GOI
                            believed it to be Taiwan. Whether purpose of raid was to cause damage or
                            to rescue rebel leader made no difference to GOI, he said—both cases
                            constituted continuance of foreign intervention.</p>
                        <p>Coming at this time, he said, event was particularly unfortunate. GOI
                            would do everything possible to prevent incident reaching newspapers but
                            this was not easy with this incident added to B–26 actions of June 15
                            and 27. He did not imply that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Government had anything to do with this but requested that we do
                            everything possible to suppress further actions of this character.
                            Should story get out, he emphasized, nothing could prevent Communists
                            from exploiting situation in such a way as to cause serious
                            deterioration in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian relations
                            and destroy much of what had been accomplished in last two months.</p>
                        <p>He described plane as probably B–29, whereupon I pointed out there were
                            no B–29’s in this part of world and that I would appreciate further
                            details of aircraft description if possible. Since drop took place at
                            noon one could assume good visibility this time of year. My own guess
                            was that if in fact this was 4-engine aircraft it was probably DC–4.</p>
                        <p>Suwito said that what distressed Prime Minister was that this kind of
                            thing should still continue after rebel forces had been defeated. Since
                            big plane of this kind could easily be identified and must be serviced
                            at sizable airport, GOI recognized that effort of this character could
                            not take place without cognizance of government of whatever territory
                            involved. In interest of improving <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-Indonesian relations he pleaded that <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            prevent further occurrences, mentioning again particularly <gloss

                                appealed for military assistance from the Republic of China and Yeh
                                told Drumright “that the Chinese are continuing to assist the

                                Supplement.</note> of June 4 there seems no doubt that plane came
                            from Taiwan. At this stage of improving relations here continuance of
                            this kind of thing makes no sense. Possibility of Communist takeover of
                            Indonesia can be greatly enhanced if mutual effort to improve relations
                            can be nipped in bud. Following on heels of Pope case I can think of
                            nothing more likely to accomplish this than publicity on these incidents
                            which will inevitably follow their continuance. It is impossible to
                            convince Indonesians that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> does not
                            have sufficient influence in Pacific to stop this kind of thing if we
                            wish to and if this continues they will believe it to be case of right
                            and left hand regardless of how strong our assurances to them may be.
                            They know <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could not exist without
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support and consequently will
                            continue to believe <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> lending tacit
                            support to this kind of thing unless incidents cease.</p>

                            advantages continue limited support Indonesian rebels. I regard
                            continued rebel resistance as providing absolutely no leverage
                            whatsoever in moving Indonesians towards anti-Communist position. On
                            contrary such action only exacerbates situation and ties down GOI army

                            Indonesia. Essence of this plan was that reliable anti-Communist
                            officers would be appointed as links in nationwide system of supervision
                            in various military territories. This would apply down through village

                        <p>Re bombings he said three places in North Sulawesi—Wori, Kema, and
                            Pitung—had been bombed last night by B–26. He has been requested to
                            report to Cabinet meeting tonight on this matter and particularly <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attitude regarding it. Cabinet would
                            discuss preparation of appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            against foreign aggression, he said. He deplored this because of its
                            effect on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian relations at a
                            time when these relations were improving but he said reaction of
                            President, Prime Minister and majority of Cabinet was so strong that he
                            was afraid unless bombings <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0268"
                            />stopped decision would be taken. He did not imply <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement; he did recognize that part
                            of evidence would be submission Pope diary and other exhibits which
                            would have unfortunate effect here. Among other evidence which he had
                            not mentioned before were labels from crates containing arms showing
                            shipment from Taiwan via Clark Field. He added that President, Prime
                            Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Chief of Staff and himself were meeting
                            tomorrow to consider this whole question.</p>
                        <p>I repeated what I had said on earlier occasions, that <gloss

                            and what appeared to be evidence military assistance to rebels
                            originating outside Indonesia. I also told him that in response to
                            earlier request (Embtel 83)<note n="1" xml:id="d134fn1"><ref
                                    target="#d132">Document 132</ref>.</note> further
                            representations had been made. He reiterated what he had said earlier,
                            that GOI military controlled all airports within Indonesia from which
                            B–26 could operate. Therefore plane must be serviced on foreign
                            territory. I said we would appreciate any information as to probable
                            location of airport of origin. As he was aware, <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> Government was doing its best to discourage outside
                            assistance from whatever source.</p>
                        <p>He reverted to earlier request that Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            make some statement (Embtel 4946).<note n="2" xml:id="d134fn2">Dated

                            I pointed out that my response constituted in effect a statement by
                            Secretary since he had authorized me to provide the Foreign Minister
                            with such assurances on his behalf. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> said that important thing about statement on
                            part of Secretary was effect on Indonesian people generally as well as
                            upon President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in
                            particular. If <persName>Dulles</persName> made public statement it
                            would be taken as gospel here. Witness tremendous effect May 20
                            statement had upon situation.</p>
                        <p>I responded along lines of Deptel 3935<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Dated

                            emphasized that it would appear somewhat gratuitous with world-wide
                            attention focused on Middle East for Secretary to make a statement
                            regarding Indonesian rebellion which everywhere in America was
                            considered as having been concluded. Foreign Minister continued to
                            plead, leading me to conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> himself had suggested this. I said that I would
                            of course report what he had said but in light of considerations I had
                            mentioned I could not be too optimistic. Foreign Minister indicated
                            global point of view and recognized it appeared as small matter but he
                            earnestly considered it could be helpful to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Indonesian relations here.</p>
                        <p>Re Iraq said Cabinet would raise question with him tonight as to
                            recognition of rebel regime and he inquired as to <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> attitude. I told him I had no information as to Iraqi
                            situation except what I had heard on radio <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243"
                                facs="0269"/>and that this obviously came from rebel source. I
                            counseled “wait and see” attitude. He indicated this was line he would
                            take but requested that I obtain as soon as possible for his information
                            analysis of situation as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> saw it and an
                            indication of our position. He would appreciate my calling him at any
                            time in office or at home in view of urgency of matter and seriousness
                            of crisis. He had already been informed that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> naval vessels were in Arabian Sea. I promised that I
                            would advise him soonest. I again raised question of when I might see

                            idea <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and perhaps Russia too is
                            adopting “wait and see” attitude toward Indonesia. This is no good. They
                            were not expecting dramatic help but they did need to be shown <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was not inactive.</p>
                        <p>This connection continuation of rebel bombings was serious psychological
                            problem to Indonesians. Even <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> did not understand it. He was saying on subject
                            of communism, “give me the tools and I will do the job.” And he wanted
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> arms. But he was baffled by
                            bombings which kept resistance going, delayed possibility his using
                            troops for anti-Communist purpose and generally upset schedule he and
                            Prime Minister had in mind.</p>
                        <p>“Let us not reach an impasse,” <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> pleaded. I replied we were just as anxious as
                            he to avoid an impasse. But we had to work this out together. <gloss

                            intentions. One of purposes of my talk with <persName

                            Foreign Minister was bluffing or tossing out thinly veiled threat, but
                            this is not my judgement. We appear to be gradually sliding backward as
                            result of continued bombings to something resembling situation

                        <p>As to request for Secretary to make some statement on continuation of
                            bombings, I recognize validity of considerations raised in Deptel 3935.
                            However in view of recent publicity here on B–29 and B–26 raids, perhaps
                            Department could plant question in Secretary’s press conference which
                            would bring out brief comment that would help us here. I make this
                            suggestion with considerable hesitation because I am reluctant to add to
                            Secretary’s burdens at time when his full attention needs to be
                            concentrated elsewhere. But this might be of considerable importance in
                            preventing deterioration relations with GOI leaders particularly

                            most serious mood when I saw him at Bogor this morning. He greeted me
                            cordially but even before serving coffee, he said, shaking his head,
                            “Trouble, trouble, trouble.” Then before I had chance to comment, he
                            said urgently, “Tell me about Middle East. What will happen there?”</p>
                        <p>[Here follows brief discussion of the Lebanon crisis.]</p>
                        <p>President then said the psychological situation between Indonesia and
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was not good and was beginning
                            again to deteriorate. He said improvement that had occurred few weeks
                            ago had been pretty well wiped out by continuation of bombings by B–26s.
                            I commented along <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0272"/>lines of
                            Deptel 163 and then made point that, unlike Soviet Russia with
                            satellites, we could not give orders to independent countries in Far
                            East and consequently had no control over situation. Repeated
                            representations had been made to these countries. If bombings were
                            continued it was undoubtedly reflection of grave concern of neighboring
                            governments at growing strength and influence of Communist Party in
                            Indonesia. I pointed out such concern was only natural. I was certain
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would feel the
                            same way if he believed Malaya was about to go Communist and then I
                            developed points in Deptel 3901, emphasizing character of <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as foreign controlled party within
                            Indonesia, referring to Nehru’s statements and breaking off presentation
                            prior to presenting statement of what <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            was prepared to do. At this point I said we recognized that new
                            situation had developed as result of military victory over rebels and
                            Cabinet reshuffle and my government would be most interested to know
                            what President had in mind by way of next steps to solve problems from
                            which country was suffering and establish political and economic
                            stability. This, I emphasized, was what my government as well as
                            governments of neighboring countries wished to see in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>At this point President interjected, “I can assure you that I will never
                            permit a Communist coup d’état in this country.” I said I recognized
                            that this was true—that he had so demonstrated at Madiun. What
                            Indonesia’s neighbors feared was not this so much as growing political
                            strength of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> which would enable it to
                            seize power as result of exploiting ordinary processes of democracy.
                            “How, in other words, are you planning to curb growing influence of
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> within your country”, I
                            asked.</p>
                        <p>“This is a complex question,” President replied slowly. “It involves
                            economic, political and military considerations. I can assure you that
                            Indonesia will never follow the route of Czechoslovakia”.</p>
                        <p>I pressed him to be specific. I said that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> Government would be prepared to extend additional
                            substantial economic aid and such military aid as would seem appropriate
                            to enable Indonesia to maintain elimination of Communist threat.</p>
                        <p>In commenting President led off with discussion of cabinet reshuffle. “I
                            abolished Petra, Hanafi’s ministry, because I had been informed that
                            this was Communist dominated. I will tell you why I was unwilling to
                            throw him out of Cabinet. When I was in exile in Benkoelen in South
                            Sumatra, Hanafi was a young boy. He comes from Benkoelen. I became
                            acquainted with him there and taught him revolutionary way which
                            Indonesia must follow. He became an ardent follower of mine and later
                            when he organized our revolutionary army I appointed him Lt. Col. He has
                            been close to me through years. He is even indirectly related to me. His
                            brother, a newspaperman in Medan, named Hadi, is married to my <pb
                                n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0273"/>foster daughter. Hanafi is no
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> member. He is Leftist
                            revolutionary. He is loyal to me but he understands feeling of the
                            masses. He is popular with labor union members throughout Indonesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> then turned to <gloss
                                target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> Party. “I will tell you exactly what I
                            have been telling <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> leaders,” he said.
                            “This is a struggle to win masses, I say to them, why do you not do as
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> does? Why do you not organize
                            masses? You must become more Left and fight <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> on its own ground. <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>
                            is my own child,” he said, but <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> has
                            not been as effective as <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> had advantage of
                            being well-financed, well-trained under professional organizers,
                            uninhibited in what they could promise, etc.</p>
                        <p>“That is what my <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> people tell me,”
                            President rejoined, “but that is no excuse. I had no money to start
                            revolution. It takes work and determination and small contributions from
                            many people”.</p>
                        <p>“Then your answer to Communist threat is basically political one, I
                            suggested. “Pantjasila front led by <gloss target="#t_PNI1"
                            >PNI</gloss>”.</p>
                        <p>“That is correct,” President replied.</p>
                        <p>“But” I objected, “this will take time. Time is running out. What plans
                            have you to deal with interim contingencies?”</p>
                        <p>President pointed to himself and said, “I and the military. I can control
                            99% of military. We will do what needs to be done”.</p>
                        <p>I reminded him that there were already indications of Communist arrogance
                            in certain parts of Java. He nodded, pointed to military control of
                            demonstration, etc., and reiterated firmly that this kind of thing would
                            be prevented.</p>
                        <p>In economic field, overlapping military and educational field, President
                            said he was establishing national planning board to prepare blueprint
                            for Indonesian development. This was board for which special planning
                            committee headed by <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> was
                            now working out structure and function. Board would be composed of
                            technicians and experts, he emphasized, not politicians. It would be
                            broadly representative of functional groups and of regions throughout
                            Indonesia. This board would go to work intensively after establishment
                            and prepare blueprint by next year.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile he hoped America would give evidence of its support for
                            Indonesia, “I want America and Indonesia to come closer and closer
                            together. Above all” he said, “I hope America will not be negative but
                            will be positive, that you will not do things and take positions which
                            play into hands of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> here and
                            strengthen their hold on the people”. He reverted to B–26s and then
                            referred to West Irian. “This is an obsession with me,” he admitted.
                            “But if America would support Indonesia on West Irian I could (and he
                            snapped his fingers) change Indonesia’s <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                facs="0274"/>attitude towards America overnight. I have said this
                            many times but it is still true. It is hard for our people to understand
                            why Russia can support without equivocation our claim to Irian and why
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>—claiming to be our friend—remains
                            silent. If America could only say that they consider our claim a just
                            claim, this would make all the difference” he went on in this vein for
                            several minutes playing old record.</p>
                        <p>When he had finished I did not argue case but simply said, “Mr.
                            President, I think that whole subject of West Irian needs cooling off
                            period”. I then pointed out that fear on part of her neighbors of
                            Indonesia’s going Communist was, entirely aside from Dutch position,
                            element in Irian problem. If neighbors no longer had fear of Communist
                            Indonesia and believed Indonesia to be politically and economically
                            stable, some neighbors might feel differently about Indonesia possessing
                            Irian. I emphasized this was personal observation.</p>
                        <p>I then made additional points in Deptel 3901 and economic points in
                            Deptel 3911.</p>
                        <p>When President indicated he must leave for luncheon in Djakarta, I
                            suggested desirability of continuing conversation in near future and of
                            keeping in close touch now that some progress had been made in
                            improvement of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indo relations.
                            President readily agreed but with reservations such meetings should not
                            be too visible. He suggested my stopping at Bogor en route to Puntjak
                            occasionally on weekends when visit would have appearance of informal
                            social call and would be unobserved by any but his own staff.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Throughout conversation <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was intensely serious.
                            There were none of the histrionics for which he is famous, no turning on
                            either of his magnetic charm or his flushing indignation. He spoke
                            gravely and quietly but impressively.</p>
                        <p>I had impression that he was convinced of sincerity of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy with regard to preservation
                            Indonesian independence and non-interference with Indonesian foreign
                            policy. My frank remarks about Indonesian misunderstanding of <gloss

                        <p>President’s parting words were, “Let us have no war, no war. This would
                            be bad for everybody.”</p>

                            After consideration content and general tenor President’s remarks made
                            in course my July 21 meeting with him at Bogor, I have following
                            additional comments:</p>
                        <p>1. Believe <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, as strong
                            advocate Afro-Asian bloc concept, genuinely disturbed at what he and
                            others in government, confusing struggle to realize popular aspirations
                            with unprincipled, externally supported power grabs, have felt is
                            western suppression legitimate nationalist manifestations in Middle
                            East. Have impression my presentation of limited <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> objectives and motives fairly convincing to him; in any
                            case his desires study <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position, and
                            evidence on which based, is heartening.</p>
                        <p>2. President for first time personally confirmed many reports that he
                            cognizant <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> danger and that new
                            posture of <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss> has his endorsement and
                            encouragement. I also consider significant his admission that army main
                            instrument to curb <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> (thus implicitly
                            acknowledging army strength and often-reported anti-communist firmness
                            of army leadership), pending political control through Pantjasila front
                            device. If, I hope, more frequent meetings with President materialize,
                            opportunity can be sought discuss with him desirability that
                            anti-communist political front, if it expected cope successfully with
                            regional and economic problems, include non-Javanese Party
                            representation.</p>
                        <p>3. President deeply concerned by continuation B–26 raids and while it my
                            impression he wishes accept at face value <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> position, he still perplexed by and possibly skeptical
                            my assertion that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> powerless to stop
                            them. He may have had raids in mind when he cautioned against <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> action that could be exploited by <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. Lack of publicity concerning raids
                            (most recently reported incidents not yet publicly released) and
                            restrained handling Pope case and other “evidence” foreign support rebel
                            cause is of course regarded by GOI as favorable to <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and anti-Communist position in that
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> deprived of highly exploitable
                            and anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> material.</p>
                        <p>4. Atmosphere this meeting with President most gratifying since my
                            arrival. He gave impression of man conscious his burden and endeavoring
                            find best solution by candid consultation with minimum <pb n="250"
                                xml:id="pg_250" facs="0276"/>pretense or playing for effect. I left
                            with impression that President desires friendly relations with <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>; is at long last becoming disturbed by
                            Communist threat to Indonesia; is now prepared to encourage moves
                            against <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> although I see no early
                            prospect of his taking public stand against Communists. Also implicit
                            although never explicit in conversation was assumption future of
                            Indonesia security and area security dependent <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>. I propose take early opportunity test his declaration
                            that more frequent meetings in relative privacy Bogor Palace would be
                            welcome.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s recognition of
                            army role in curbing Communists and admission of necessity for
                            inter-related military and political action against <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> ties in with information we have
                            received from <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and other
                            government leaders. It presents <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with
                            opportunity to provide tools for accomplishment of objective I believe
                            is becoming mutual. There was definite indication in <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> conversation President
                            beginning to be aware that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and GOI
                            interests coincide in this respect. Although President was not as
                            specific as might be desired in outlining anti-Communist program, what
                            he said makes clear to me that he is supporting <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> in their efforts.</p>
                        <p>It is always possible, of course, that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> was saying what he thought we wanted to hear,

                        <p>Before considering the memorandum submitted by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> on July 30<note n="1"

                            recommending several courses of action which might be taken by the
                            United States, the Secretary was given a short briefing on current
                            developments in Indonesia. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CHSJ1"
                                >Cumming</persName> reviewed especially recent activities by the
                            dissidents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> stated that the
                            Department of Defense felt that the U.S. should attempt to build up
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>’s strength as an
                            anti-communist step in Java since he has displayed good-will toward us
                            and his prestige in the government has increased. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> pointed out that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has said that he agrees with
                            the objectives of the rebels although not with the methods used by them
                            in attaining those objectives. He would therefore also seem to be the
                            logical person through whom a reconciliation of the various factions in
                            Indonesia might be attempted.</p>
                        <p>After a short discussion of the situation in Indonesia the Secretary 1)
                            said there appeared to be general agreement that we should go ahead with
                            the actions listed in Tab A of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s memorandum of July 30 (copy attached). Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> had
                            recommended phased delivery of the military package. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that it was important also
                            that the actions taken be developed in such a way as to permit <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> to get the maximum benefit
                            from them. In the light of this discussion the Secretary added at the
                            end of the first sentence <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0282"/>of
                            Paragraph 1 (a) of the Courses of Action “on phased basis and on
                            military level so far as practicable”. He approved the courses of action
                            with that change. 2) said there should be a minimum of publicity and
                            that our actions should be played down as much as possible. 3) asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> to prepare a
                            study of the present status and strength of the dissidents.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Stroh stated that <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral
                                Burke</persName>, who had planned to be present at the meeting,
                            favored pointing our actions as much as possible toward <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> in line with the opinion
                            expressed by the Department of Defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> stated that he agreed with this but that it
                            should not be overlooked that this is primarily a
                            government-to-government problem and that it is impossible to keep the
                            government completely out of the picture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> suggested that
                            some effort might be made to bring the dissidents and the anti-communist
                            forces in Java together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IJNII1">Irwin</persName> said that <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and Defense recommend that in
                            addition to the package of $7 million military equipment bridges also be
                            made available to Indonesia and that the original package be augmented.
                            He said that Defense would need three things: 1) a 451
                                determination<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Reference is to the Mutual
                                Security Act of 1958, approved on June 30, 1958, which provided the
                                President with a special “contingency fund.” For text, see 72 Stat.
                                261.</note> to proceed with the $7 million package; 2) a 451
                            determination for approximately $2-1/2 million for bridges; 3) the
                            Secretary’s approval for an increase in the amount of military equipment
                            to be made available to Indonesia. He said that a letter concerning this
                            increase was on its way from the Department of Defense to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3"
                                >Reference is to a letter of July 31 from <persName

                                a letter of July 23 from Sprague to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"

                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>’
                                recommendation that the United States initiate a program of token
                                and limited military assistance to the Indonesian Armed Forces and
                                suggested specific military equipment that could be offered to the
                                Indonesians for that purpose. The letters are in Washington National
                                Records Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OASD1">OASD</gloss>/ISA

                        <p>The Secretary said that he had no information on the bridges and
                            hesitated to make a decision on the basis of an oral request. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that this
                            would be submitted to him in writing in due course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> raised the matter of
                            consultations with other governments, recommending that we inform the

                            immediately and that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCE2"

                            informed of developments. As to informing the Dutch Government, he
                            recommended that they be told as the actions were implemented. The
                            Secretary agreed.</p>

                                rebels can continue such actions for a prolonged period and, with
                                outside arms support, could seize and temporarily hold sizable
                                areas. Even in these circumstances, however, the rebels could
                                probably neither develop widespread political support nor create
                                sufficient military pressure to cause the government to seek a

                                increasing power of the Communists, army leaders have considered

                                parties so that a balance between them and the <gloss

                                will probably yield to army pressures to postpone the elections.
                                However, we believe that the chances are no better than even that he
                                could be convinced that his position would be threatened. (Paras.

                            disbelief followed by an expression of great gratification. President
                            then raised question as to what had caused this sudden change of policy

                            Minister said he had also been wondering. He wasn’t asking me but he
                            thought the President would probably raise query when I saw him. I said
                            I had no hesitation whatever in answering the question—that it was due

                            said news had arrived when he was in Bali otherwise I would have asked

                        <p>He said yes, he had heard the news from others—in fact Prime Minister,

                            said he assumed package included aid for Navy and Air Force as well as
                            Army since all three were essential for Indonesian security. I confirmed
                            that Navy was included and then explained that Air Force had not been
                            included because we did not know what equipment they had received from
                            other sources and consequently could not assess their requirements. I
                            said General <persName corresp="#p_VGRL1">Vittrup</persName> had seen
                            Marshal <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName> and had
                            discussed his current needs with him. President nodded and said he had

                                >Suryadarma</persName> to make available to us information as to his

                            be done for Air Force but I was not in position to make commitment at
                            this point.</p>

                        <p>661. For Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> from Ambassador. Deptel 357.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d147fn1"><ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> I
                            share Department’s disappointment that military aid agreement failed to
                            effect material change in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Soekarno</persName>’s well-known public attitudes.</p>
                        <p>Of even more moment, however, is that according to Department’s 357
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy now seems predicated on
                            lines which I had not heretofore understood. I refer specifically to
                            statement that “if highest authority in Indonesia instead should
                            effectively align himself with enemies of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and free world, basis of our support is destroyed”.</p>
                        <p>I am sure Department will agree that President is no more aligned with
                            enemies of free world and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> than he was
                            before the speech. Yet we reached a decision to give aid to Indonesian
                            Armed Forces in belief that they would thereby be enabled to take
                            effective action against internal Communist subversion which may
                            otherwise capture control of Indonesia by Parliamentary or other
                            means.</p>
                        <p>To conclude now that, because of one piece of July 4 oratory received by
                            the Indonesian people as one more playing of a broken record, [we] must
                            change our policy of assisting anti-Communist and potentially
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Soekarno</persName> elements,
                            would be in [my] view extreme folly.</p>
                        <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>Of course I will see Djuanda and President and report disappointment
                            which my government feels that he should have attacked everything we
                            stand for. As explained Embtel 660,<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">Telegram
                                660, August 20, reported <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"

                                the U.S. position on the use of American military equipment and
                                services in an effort to gain control of West New Guinea.

                                Supplement.</note> it would be difficult to raise point regarding
                            “assurances” since I do not understand GOI has given assurances beyond
                            those in exchange of notes. Meanwhile I feel that our thinking here and
                            that of the Department should be brought closer together than appears to
                            be case from reference telegram.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, our military aid has been predicated on the proposition of
                            first things first. The immediate threat is not <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Soekarno</persName>’s leftish bent, third
                            force ambitions or flirtations with both sides at once, but the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> which may even now be strong enough to
                            capture Indonesia with or without the President. There is today only one
                            effective force in opposition—the Indonesian Army. We have understood it
                            to be our purpose first of all to strengthen that force and to rally all
                            anti-Communist elements around it. If this succeeds, the external
                            relationships of Indonesia will most certainly move in the direction of
                            our international objectives. If this fails we will have lost Indonesia.
                            In view of these stakes, we can hardly be diverted by <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Soekarno</persName> demagoguery, although I
                            realize that his utterances justifiably create resentment in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the free world.</p>
                        <p>In considering the case of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Soekarno</persName> it is necessary to remember that we are dealing
                            with a man who is convinced that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            gave active help to the rebellion against his government. He also
                            believes this support was directed against himself. Further, he
                            undoubtedly suspects that the military aid program is intended as
                            support for <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> against
                            himself, an argument constantly dinned into his ears by the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At no point have I understood that the objective of our aid was to win
                            over <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Soekarno</persName>, although I had
                            been led to hope that his remarks on Independence Day would be softened,
                            and apparently were softened, by the aid agreement. Although we have not
                            written off entirely the idea that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Soekarno</persName> might be changed by arraying sufficient
                            internal anti-Communist power against him, if this occurs it will be a
                            welcome by-product by [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] our immediate
                            objective—to prevent a Communist take-over of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>I would appreciate Department’s comments.</p>

                            you will recall that policy we are now following in Indonesia is subject
                            to divided counsel and you can well imagine that serious doubts exist as
                            to its wisdom. Many sectors of U.S. public opinion do not make
                            distinction between support for <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>, Army and other non-Communists and support for
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. These sectors of
                            opinion also sympathize readily with dissidents who are patently
                            anti-Communist and therefore less readily understands how it is that our
                            present policy is anti-Communist. There is confusion as to why we seem
                            not to support anti-Communist dissidents but rather President, who
                            castigates us and who permitted Indonesia to slide into present
                            precarious situation (remember <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                            editorial, August 6).</p>
                        <p>It is not only public, however, which is skeptical. I have been on notice
                            for some days to meet with Senators Knowland<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2"
                                >William F. Knowland (R.–California), member of the Senate Foreign

                            we are backing this horse.<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">On August 20,
                                Senator Styles Bridges (R.–New Hampshire), member of the Senate
                                Foreign Relations Committee, made a statement in the Senate
                                criticizing the U.S. Government’s decision to sell arms to Indonesia
                                as “shocking.” The Department transmitted a summary of his remarks
                                to the Embassy in telegram 380 to Djakarta, August 21. (Department
                                of State, Central Files, 756D.5–MSP/8–2158) See Supplement.</note>
                            Moreover, you know about debates not only within Executive branch but
                            within Department which have occupied us right down to present. There
                            has been no unaniminity of conviction on our present policy at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Given this situation, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            undermines our policy every time he confirms and fortifies views of
                            those who hold he is playing both sides and making suckers of us. If it
                            is true that what we and our press say about <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and Indonesia can cause
                            reactions there and threaten basis for our cooperation, reverse is also
                            true. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wants to
                            destroy our current policy one of the best means surely is for him to
                            make more speeches along August 17 line. Basis of policy is fragile
                            although we hope with time its wisdom as only possible course which
                            would strengthen anti-commie centers of power, principally army, will
                            become evident. I of course agree <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> is no more aligned with our enemies after than
                            he was before speech; point is he unfortunately appears no less aligned
                            than before.</p>
                        <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>Similarly it is dangerous for continuance of our current policy for
                                <persName corresp="#p_VGRL1">Vittrup</persName> to raise hopes of
                            broader and more extensive cooperation with and aid to Indonesian armed
                            forces than we now have authority for or any prospects of getting,
                            particularly if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            continues to beat his unhelpful drums. It is natural for him to be
                            zealous but he must be kept within limits of authority granted.</p>
                        <p>We are sending you other messages on this and also question of assurances
                            received about use our token packet of arms. I would like to conclude
                            this one by saying I do not think there is any difference between you
                            and me in our understanding of what our policy is predicated on and I
                            appreciate your continued skillful handling of a very difficult
                            situation. I also welcomed your strong caution against changing our

                                15, Sebald reported on a conversation with Casey regarding the West
                                New Guinea problem. Casey said that his cabinet had discussed the
                                issue three times in the past week to reach agreement on a position
                                for discussions Casey will have in The Hague, London, and presumably
                                Washington. Casey felt that immediate objective “should be work out
                                some deterrent to Indonesians using force against West New Guinea.
                                He feels first shot fired by Indonesians would cause chain reaction
                                ultimate results of which cannot be foreseen. Casey also told Sebald
                                that Australian public opinion has “been built up to point where
                                West New Guinea has become symbol of Australian security and use of
                                force by Indonesians would cause violent reaction here.”(<hi

                            stated latest available information indicates United States has now
                            supplied landing craft and also proposes supply anti-submarine
                            vessels.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> said with considerable
                            earnestness one problem which could defeat his government in coming
                            election would be wave of Australian resentment against growing strength
                            Indonesia because of United States arms policy and possibility Indonesia
                            might in consequence take aggressive action against West New Guinea.
                            This would pose government with dilemma whereby on one hand if open
                            support were given to Dutch, government would be charged in United
                            Nations and elsewhere with support colonialism, whereas if nothing were
                            done and West New Guinea fell to Indonesia, government would be
                            pilloried for jeopardizing Australian security.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> thought in length [<hi

                            essential some deterrent be formulated against Indonesian ambitions. He
                            thought United States only country which can provide such deterrent and
                            hoped something could be worked out whereby United States would make it
                            crystal-clear to Indonesians that if any arms furnished by United States
                            were used for aggression against New Guinea United States would take
                            appropriate action. He thought present Indonesian assurance this context
                            meaningless as Indonesia could claim West New Guinea entirely domestic
                            problem and not within contemplation its assurance or United Nations
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> drew parallel with Taiwan
                            situation and pointed out United States had made it clear that any
                            attack on Taiwan would be countered by United States. Likewise it could
                            be said Australia’s security demanded it be made clear that attack on
                            West New Guinea would be attack on Australia. He said considerable
                            portion of cabinet inclined adopt this as official policy toward New
                            Guinea but he prefers not do so at this time.</p>

                                >Menzies</persName> parenthetically said considerable body of

                            Australia should recognize Red China. He felt New Zealand would do so
                            within one or two years and thus raise Australian pressures but even
                            then if still in power he would refuse. He would not <pb n="273"

                            wedge between United States and Australia. This policy has been firmly
                            adopted by government notwithstanding continuing accusations by
                            opposition that government’s foreign policy is too subservient to United

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> said Casey would explain

                                    153</ref>.</note> He thought Australian public has apparently
                            accepted small arms aid but United States action in making available
                            potentially offensive-type equipment such as landing craft will not be
                            understood and could have serious repercussions. He also mentioned
                            Australia’s efforts to dissuade British from furnishing Indonesia
                            aircraft and other equipment.</p>
                        <p>I told Prime Minister that insofar as I aware there is no indication
                            whatsoever Indonesia plans or intends attack West New Guinea by force
                            and while I was not informed re landing craft, any arms or equipment
                            made available by United States were in fact for internal use only.
                            Although I had not seen precise wording of undertaking given by
                            Indonesian Government, it seemed clear that point re possible use these
                            arms for aggressive purposes was very much in mind my government. It
                            seemed to me his concern could be divided into short-term problem of
                            domestic considerations and long-term problem of Australia’s security.
                            Re latter particularly I felt certain nothing would be done to undermine
                            or weaken security of Australia with which we were so closely allied. I
                            said this problem is one which is heavily charged with emotion and as he
                            knew, Dutch particularly often greatly exaggerated situation. Question
                            of supply arms was delicate one of preventing Commies from moving into
                            vacuum which would otherwise be created, and yet not supplying too much
                            until situation further clarified and stabilized. <persName

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Walter</persName></hi>: I have been
                            here just six months and have several times started to write you, only
                            to have events in this fast moving situation overtake what I had wanted
                            to say. I am also keenly aware of the tremendous burden of reading in
                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and have not wished to add
                            unnecessarily to it.</p>
                        <p>First, I do want to express my deep appreciation for the wonderful
                            support you have been giving us here. This goes for all of <gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and the Secretary, of course, but no one
                            knows better than I who has led the fight and no one appreciates more
                            than I the difficulties involved in some of the problems and situations
                            we have had to pass to you for solution.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that we are embarked on the right course. Since the
                            announcement and actual delivery of military aid here, the very
                            atmosphere <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0301"/>in Djakarta has
                            noticeably changed. When my car passes by, people wave and smile and
                            several times this past week, teenagers on their bicycles have waved and
                            cried, “Hi, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>.” This has
                            even happened to Mary Lou when she has been alone without a flag on the
                            car. And several Indonesians have commented that all Indonesia heaved a
                            great sigh of relief when the bridge was crossed which seemed to them to
                            prove that America was with them instead of against them.</p>
                        <p>The President’s taking a ride in the Globemaster had a significance out
                            of all proportion to the event itself. It helped to avoid any impression
                            that we were backing <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and removed
                            the impression in some circles that the President was less enthusiastic
                            about American military aid than Djuanda and the Army. Finally, it
                            tended to line up the President with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> in Indonesian eyes and was considered here as more a
                            political gesture than anything else.</p>
                        <p>In saying the above, I don’t mean to imply that I am in any sense betting
                            on the President. He continues to be “all things to all men”. But he is
                            not merely a power factor here today; he is the dominant power factor
                            and part of the problem we face here is to keep him genuinely
                            neutralized while anti-Communist forces within the country are built up
                            to do the job that must be done here. I know that the Secretary does not
                            want <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to get the
                            credit for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance and I think he
                            is absolutely right.</p>
                        <p>So far, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has not only
                            not gotten the credit, he has made no effort to take the credit. This,
                            frankly, is what worried me more about his August 17 speech than
                            anything else. His failure at least to give <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> aid a nod in the speech was to me an indication that he
                            doubted we meant business or that he interpreted it as an anti-<persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> move. This, too, was one of
                            the reasons that putting on the airplane ride for the President assumed,
                            from our side, an exceptional importance. I am glad we were able to do
                            it. Had we not done so after his request, the negative implications
                            would have been just as strong against us as the positive implications
                            have been since we carried it off successfully. All this may have seemed
                            “Much ado about nothing” in Washington, but it represented a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> triumph locally.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we have turned the corner and that if we are able to
                            maintain the momentum we now have, our chances of achieving our
                            objectives are reasonably good. Again, let me emphasize that I think we
                            certainly should not at this point be led into putting our faith in or
                            our chips on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.
                            Gestures in his direction are important—they help to keep him on course
                            with those Indonesians whose objectives are the same as ours. That is
                            why I think it imperative for us to break loose the TB hospital
                            equipment. The amount of money involved is small compared with the good
                            it will do in terms of keeping <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> in line. Don’t let anyone in Washington consider
                            that at this stage I or anyone in the <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276"
                                facs="0302"/>Embassy has any illusions on the subject of wooing
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Let’s do what we
                            can to keep him from being completely taken in by forces actively moving
                            against us. This requires, as l see it, a skillful combination of power
                            factors moving Indonesia in the direction we wish to see it go and to
                            which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will bend if
                            they are sufficiently strong, and enough gestures toward the President
                            at least to encourage him to support this internal struggle against the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is another reason for a gesture or two in <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s direction: to keep him
                            from moving against <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>.
                            His natural suspicions are being fanned by the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>. He can cause us no end of trouble if he reaches the
                            conclusion which I am convinced he is testing in his mind that we are
                            building up the Army in a move against him as well as against the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. The same reasoning applies, of course,
                            to at least limited aid for the Indonesian Air Force. But I need not
                            elaborate on that. You have had our cables.</p>
                        <p>I should like to revert to a suggestion I made sometime ago—the
                            possibility of Djuanda’s visiting the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                            I think that if we move forward as we hope here that visits by both
                                <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> would be most useful. I am
                            not advocating this at present. First, we have to come closer together
                            with the Indonesians. Also we have the President to worry about. It
                            could hurt both men if the President thought we were beginning to play
                            up to them rather than himself. Our tactics in connection with any such
                            invitations will have to be thought through very carefully. But we
                            should bear the above in mind in planning <gloss target="#t_FE1"
                                >FE</gloss> area official visits to Washington next year.<note n="1"

                                    >Jones</persName> reads in part as follows: “I share completely

                                know, and I suspect most politically aware Indonesians also realize,
                                that he has been in the past few years a divisive and disruptive
                                influence. He is nonetheless a primary political force and a
                                political fact of life that we are going to have to live with. We
                                should be under no illusions that we can make him over into a
                                genuinely constructive influence and a champion of the Free World.
                                We must at the same time do what we can to neutralize and contain
                                his disruptive capacities, and deny to the Communists his continued

                            for each new parcel would nip in the bud the developing Indo belief that

                            postpone elections as means of averting Communist takeover, and

                            positive developments in our favor. We can expect more such actions if
                            the momentum of our arms aid program is not lost.</p>
                        <p>Of course I am constantly aware of the political problems with our Dutch
                            and Australian allies which are inherent in our present policy in
                            Indonesia. It is necessary to keep equally in the forefront that we do
                            not nor does anyone, have capability of preventing Indonesia from
                            building up her military forces to whatever size Indonesians feel
                            appropriate. The only question is whether this is to be done with our
                            aid, and with those restraints that we may be able to impose in our role
                            as grantor, or with the aid of the Soviet bloc which encourages
                            Indonesia to defy both the Netherlands and Australia on the West Irian
                            question.</p>
                        <p>This applies with equal force to question of offensive and defensive
                            weapons. Of course it is not possible to draw a meaningful line between
                            offensive and defensive equipment in military field and in my opinion we
                            should not attempt to do so. (The Hague 417 to Department September

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said that the
                            Australians were exercised over the threats to West New Guinea. He said
                            they do not believe that the Indonesians are likely to use force to get
                            West New Guinea within the next six to twelve months but that there was
                            genuine anxiety in Australia as to what might happen beyond that period.
                            The Dutch have asked the Australian Government for assurances of support
                            in case of an Indonesian attack against West New Guinea. The Australians
                            have given them no such assurances although they have discussed with the
                            Dutch all aspects of the problem. When the Dutch raise the issue, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said, the Australians
                            pass it off by pointing out the danger of leaks and suggest other
                            deterrents to the use of force. The United States is in the best
                            position to exercise the most effective deterrent by placing conditions
                            on any economic or military aid it might extend to Indonesia. The
                            Minister asked whether it would be possible for the U.S. to inform the
                            Indonesians that it plans within the next 18 months to give additional
                            aid to Indonesia but only on condition that they will not use force
                            against West New Guinea. Such conditions could be stated privately, but
                            it would be preferable if they could be made public.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said he had spent
                            two days in Ottawa in talks with Prime Minister Diefenbaker. He had
                            asked the Prime Minister if while in New Delhi in the course of his
                            forthcoming visit to several countries in the area he would talk to
                            Prime Minister Nehru in an effort to get Nehru to exercise some
                            moderating influence on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>. Prime Minister Diefenbaker agreed to do that.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> thought this would
                            be helpful since Canada has good relations with India and Diefenbaker
                            apparently hit it off well with Nehru at the Prime Ministers’
                            Conference.</p>
                        <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0306"/>
                        <p>Short of that, Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said
                            there did not appear to be any deterrent to the use of force by
                            Indonesia to obtain possession of West New Guinea. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is a fanatic and may not
                            under any conditions be deterred. The Australian position is that they
                            have supported the Dutch in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            that since they have been influential in preventing any Indonesian
                            resolution from getting a two-thirds majority they feel an obligation to
                            the Dutch and would find it difficult not to support the Dutch in this
                            case. The Australian Government is aware, however, that should it give
                            support to the Dutch in case of an Indonesian attack against West New
                            Guinea the firing of the first Australian shot would cancel out all
                            Australian influence not only in Indonesia but in all of Asia. The Asian
                            countries, whether they agree with the merits of the Indonesian claim or
                            not, would certainly support Indonesia in such a case. The Minister
                            thought this would be true even of the Philippines. He said that on the
                            basis of private conversations they had reason to believe Serrano agrees
                            with the Australia-Dutch position but in public he must take a different
                            stand.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the issue here is the same as that of the
                            offshore islands in that Indonesia claims that West New Guinea is part
                            of Indonesia and therefore wishes to liberate it. The Secretary said
                            that he did not think there is any fear of Indonesia taking West New
                            Guinea by force unless Indonesia falls under communist control. They
                            make speeches and so on for public consumption but we do not believe
                            their intentions are to use force. We feel that if they get a moderate
                            amount of arms from us we may be in a position to influence them. Out of
                            the revolutionary situation which developed there during the early part
                            of the year there seems to have emerged an apparent willingness on the
                            part of the armed forces to work with us and to take steps against the
                            communist threat. The situation there has worked out not too badly.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said there was no
                            question in the Australian mind concerning the sale by the United States
                            of arms for internal security. The Secretary commented that any attack
                            against West New Guinea would, of course, be disastrous and that we
                            would throw our force against such an attack. He said we do not have
                            Congressional authorization to do so but some way could be found if such
                            developed. Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>
                            wondered if there were any sanctions which we could apply to prevent
                            such development. The Secretary commented that there were many things we
                            could do, such as economic sanctions. If Congress were in session we
                            could of course get authorization if necessary for the use of force.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSH1">Beale</persName> commented that
                            the important thing, however, is that on these issues we must take the
                            position that force cannot be used to reach settlement. A world opinion
                            supporting this position must be created.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSH1">Beale</persName> referred to the
                            assurances obtained by the U.S. from the Indonesians in connection with
                            the sale of military equipment and pointed out that we had not gotten a
                            specific reply from the Indonesians on this point. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the legal people in
                            the Department feel that the assurances given us do cover the use of the
                            arms for an attack against West New Guinea. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> also feels that he has obtained
                            the necessary assurances. The Secretary commented that it might help if
                            further discussions on this issue take place to have more explicit
                            assurances.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to comment on Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>’s referring to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as a fanatic. In his
                            opinion <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is not a
                            fanatic in the same sense as Syngman Rhee, <persName corresp="#p_JJ3"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>, but rather a schemer, and a smooth and adroit
                            politician.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> in departing reiterated
                            that although the Dutch were most anxious to have a formal commitment
                            from the Australian Government to come to their assistance in case of an
                            armed attack against West New Guinea he wanted us to know that he had
                            not given them such assurances. The Secretary commented that he would
                            not have objected had the Australians given the Dutch such
                                assurances.<note n="1" xml:id="d153fn1">Following the meeting with

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said his Government
                            realized that the problems of West New Guinea and of Indonesia were
                            perhaps not of first importance to the United States in the face of our
                            many other worldwide problems and responsibilities. Nevertheless, they
                            were very important to the Dutch.</p>
                        <p>He wanted to say first that the Netherlands would support our China
                            policy in the exclusion of China from the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Also they would support our position as regards Taiwan
                            and the offshore islands.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0308"/>
                        <p>The Dutch felt that they had had a “raw deal” in the postwar period,
                            particularly from the US. Some members of the Dutch Government
                            constantly urged him to appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Commission to reestablish the conditions that had been foreseen, but he
                            knew that this, while legalistically sound, was practically impossible.
                            The past could not be erased.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch recognize that this <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Administration had no responsibility for what they regarded as the sins
                            of the preceding. He did feel, however, that we had been lacking in that
                            we had not sufficiently opposed the scandalous behavior of Indonesia in
                            stealing Dutch property and repudiating even commercial debts. They were
                            “gangsters”. We had taken a strong line with Iran when it seized the
                            Abadan refinery. We had taken a strong line with Egypt when it seized
                            the Suez Canal Company. But we had been indifferent in Indonesia. The
                            Dutch were inclined to feel that our arms policy was unsound. It would
                            not stop them from getting arms from the Soviet bloc. In some ways, the
                            danger to West New Guinea was greatest if Indonesia was not Communist.
                            There would then be less restraint because the Soviet Union would
                            exercise a measure of restraint, and there would be less free world
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>I said that these matters could all be discussed in Washington.<note

                                Washington and discussed West New Guinea and Indonesia. (Memorandum

                            the idea that we did not consider the Indonesia-West New Guinea
                            situation as important. We gave it high priority indeed. It was part of
                            the whole problem of the West Pacific position and keeping the far shore
                            of the Pacific in friendly hands. This was not only important to the
                            free world but to the security of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I said there might be differences of opinion between us as to how to
                            carry out our objectives, but the objectives were the same. Implementing
                            these was difficult and there were differences of opinion within our own
                            government. Therefore it was not surprising that there might be
                            differences of opinion with the Dutch Government, but our basic
                            propositions were united.</p>
                        <p>I said (with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Young</persName> being
                            present) that I expected to state our China position in general terms
                            which would equally apply to an attempt by Indonesia to seize West New
                            Guinea by force.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: We see the problem of West New
                            Guinea within the context of the larger problem of Indonesia. The big
                            stake in the area <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0310"/>is Indonesia
                            itself rather than the problem of West New Guinea. We say if West New
                            Guinea and all of Indonesia goes under Communist control, the situation
                            will be very bad. [<hi rend="italic">11 lines of source text not

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Begin Secret</hi></p>
                        <p>I think we have achieved a measure of success in that respect, although
                            it would be premature to say that it had been a complete success. I
                            think it has created a situation where at the present time the
                            government of Indonesia—and I agree that in that government by far the
                            most potent force is <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName>—sees now the danger of allowing the Communist
                            influence to grow and alienating the West and perhaps leading to a
                            revival of subversive activities, and they have switched to a more truly
                            neutralist policy in the sense of trying to have a policy which would
                            not seriously antagonize either the Communist world or the Western world
                            and particularly the United States.</p>
                        <p>That has been brought about in part by [<hi rend="italic">1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] encouragement to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, in particular, the army
                            people who are disposed to be anti-Communist.</p>
                        <p>There have been a number of developments which indicated that there was
                            growing resistance in Indonesia to Communism and to the possible
                            Communist take-over. Perhaps one of the most significant episodes in
                            that respect has been the postponement of the elections, which will give
                            more time to organize the anti-Communist parties. At the moment the
                            organization of the Communist party has been so effective that probably
                            if there were early elections it would be preponderant in the
                            returns.</p>
                        <p>The policy that we embarked upon here may require us to continue and
                            possibly to extend somewhat our military assistance. That I must say is
                            not in the form I think you used the word of “gifts” at one point. There
                            are no gifts involved in the military field. They are all sales.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>: On this $7,000,000
                            deal, it is a sale, but it is a sale on which there is a low value. It
                            is a sale at a reduced price.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: Whether that is a gift, below
                            value, is a debatable question. I am sure the Defense Department would
                            like to get a higher price for it, but it is a question of how you value
                            this more or less obsolete, secondary equipment. That is a debatable
                            point.</p>
                        <p>I had a long talk yesterday with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName>,<note n="1" xml:id="d156fn1">September 30.

                            according to my estimation, a more reasonable view of this situation
                            than some of his associates, and I do not think that he is strongly
                            opposed to our policy although we did not give any indication as to what
                            the development of that policy might involve in the way of further <pb
                                n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0311"/>equipment. Indeed, we have come
                            to no conclusion about that ourselves. There are various recommendations
                            made to us from Djakarta which are in process of being evaluated at the
                            present time, and they have not come up to me yet with any
                            recommendation, so I am in ignorance as to what the plans may be,
                            although I do know that they contemplate some assistance to both the Air
                            Force and the Navy and that they involve a category of goods which could
                            be used for either aggressive or defensive purposes.</p>
                        <p>It is not easy to draw a line, as you are well aware, between so-called
                            offensive and defensive weapons. Almost any weapon can be used
                            offensively. Obviously if you give them pistols and sidearms, they are
                            less effective than if you give them other types of arms.</p>
                        <p>Now from the standpoint of the armament business, I would say first of
                            all that we think that the Indonesians are extremely foolish in devoting
                            as much of their resources as they are to armament. They are in a
                            desperate economic position and I think it is folly for them to be
                            spending as much of their diminishing resources as they are upon
                            armament. They are mortgaging themselves to the Soviet bloc to a very
                            considerable extent already. We make such arguments to many countries of
                            the world, and always my experience is that those arguments fall upon
                            deaf ears. I have never talked with anybody anywhere in the world that I
                            know of, including in the United States, who spends less money on
                            armament because of economic necessities and the need for a balanced
                            budget and considerations of that kind. And I think the situation is one
                            where the demands of the military people will to a considerable extent
                            be met, and the problem is, will they be met from the United States or
                            from the Soviet Union or from whatever sources which will be available
                            to them.</p>
                        <p>Of course, as I said, there are other markets in Europe to which they
                            would turn, just as they were able to buy a considerable amount from the
                            United Kingdom and other countries of Europe which will have potential
                            markets open to them.</p>
                        <p>We are in a sort of curious situation in these matters, because whenever
                            a country turns to the Soviet Union for military aid we throw up our
                            hands in horror and consider that to be a very serious political defeat,
                            and then when they turn to us for military aid and assistance, we do not
                            put the same interpretation upon their actions. Of course, in fact, the
                            nation which supplies military equipment does get a certain control over
                            the country that receives it, because of the dependence upon
                            replacements and spare parts and the like. And it is far better, we
                            think, that Indonesia should be dependent upon us in that respect than
                            dependent upon the Soviet Union or the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Now we have given quite a lot of consideration to a request made by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> to see what if anything
                            we could do further to discourage <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286"
                                facs="0312"/>the Indonesians from the possible use of force against
                            West New Guinea, and to indicate a measure of support to West New Guinea
                            if it should be attacked.</p>
                        <p>The principle involved is, as we see it, the same principle as is
                            involved in China today, where a country claims that it is entitled to
                            do it and that to establish that claim would be in effect a civil war
                            and therefore they are justified in doing it. They can make that case
                            against West New Guinea, or, as they call it, West Irian, and that would
                            doubtless receive some support in some quarters. But we would ourselves
                            reject that thesis just as we rejected it in Korea and just as we
                            rejected it in China. And we do not believe that force ought to be used
                            for these purposes and that it is a pretense to say that it is a purely
                            internal affair when in fact we know that it does involve external
                            international factors.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> that we would
                            explore the possibilities of putting him in a position to make some
                            statement of our views on this subject when he got back. It is a
                            delicate thing to do because we do not want by anything we say to imply
                            that we reject the sincerity of the number of statements which the
                            Indonesian Government has made disavowing any intention to use force. I
                            admit some of their statements are equivocal, and on the other hand some
                            of their statements are unequivocal, and we don’t want in a sense to
                            release them from these unequivocal statements by indicating that we
                            don’t believe them or rely upon them. So I don’t know yet whether we
                            will find the formula that we will consider would enable Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> to carry out his purposes without
                            doing such harm to our Indonesian relations that would make it
                            undesirable, but we are studying that very actively at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>I think there is no doubt in the world but what if there were such an
                            attack, that the Government of the United States would be disposed to be
                            as helpful as it could to the Dutch in resisting such an attack. We are
                            not in the same position as regards that area as we are as regards the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> area or the area around
                            China and Korea, which is covered by treaties, or by Congressional
                            Resolutions or by both, and where the will of Congress has been
                            manifested to the degree that the President has authority without
                            further reference to the Congress to use military force.</p>
                        <p>However, we certainly could and I think would give logistical assistance
                            under those circumstances, and would strongly oppose in the United
                            Nations, and otherwise, the action. We would think it was a highly
                            improper breach of the principles of the Charter and that the
                            law-abiding countries ought to unite to oppose and resist it with moral
                            and material strength. We do not think that any change ought to occur
                            there by the use of force, and I hope that perhaps we would find a way
                            to make that clear which would not be offensive or dangerously offensive
                            to the Indonesians. But our basic position is that we do not think that
                            any <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0313"/>change should be effected
                            by force, and if it were attempted by force that we would strongly
                            oppose that in our political actions. We would be disposed logistically
                            to assist the defenders. Whether or not it would be necessary or
                            desirable to get Congressional action to permit actual military activity
                            is a matter that could not be answered at this time, and perhaps it
                            would depend upon the circumstances of the time.</p>
                        <p>If our relations with Indonesia develop as we expect, or at least as we
                            hope, and there does develop a considerable dependence upon the United
                            States, we would think it highly unlikely that they would in fact
                            attempt to take West New Guinea by force. And, as I say, that is perhaps
                            the best hope in the situation. It is not easy to get the Dutch to place
                            confidence in that line of policy, and I can well understand and
                            sympathize with the problems which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> has in Parliament with his public opinion, which is
                            convinced that there is (an Indonesian intention) to take it (West New
                            Guinea) by force, and they see us as supplying the sinews of war to
                            Indonesia to be used against the Dutch. I can understand that problem,
                            and I would like as well as we could to alleviate it. We are confident
                            that the policy we are following is the wisest policy from the
                            standpoint of both trying to prevent Indonesia falling into the grasp of
                            the Communists and also from the standpoint of preventing armed attack
                            against West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: If there were an
                            attack in due course in spite of everything, I imagine that would be
                            bowled into the Security Council at once, wouldn’t it?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: I would suppose so.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: I would hope by
                            you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: If it happens when I am here, I
                            will not be reluctant. I can’t commit my successor.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: I want to commit
                            you. That is all. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: Of course you can get a veto there
                            quite surely.</p>
                        <p>(Off-record discussion.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>: What is the size of
                            your program there?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: Indonesia—I just
                            can’t remember offhand, but we have got now in Australia, I would guess,
                            three or four hundred students and we are getting more all the time. We
                            have got more students from Indonesia than any other Asian country.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: I would think I can just say this.
                            I would very much doubt the wisdom of putting anything in the
                            communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: Oh, not mentioning
                            this directly, no; but broadening out what is said about the use of
                            force any place at any time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: Well, that might be.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: Broadening out
                            this question.</p>
                        <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0314"/>
                        <p>One other point, Mr. Secretary: There was being considered generally at
                            one time, I think, whether or not you came to a decision about it, that
                            you should be the sole supplier of arms as far as the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries are concerned.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d156fn2">See <ref target="#d20">Document 20</ref>.</note>
                            Has that gone by the board completely or is that a possibility
                            still?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: I don’t think it is a very good
                            possibility, although I do think this, I think there should be, if it
                            can be practically arranged, an exchange of information between friendly
                            countries, members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, so that we
                            each know what the other is doing and do not run the risk of an
                            excessive action in that respect through each being ignorant of what the
                            others may be doing. We tried to have arrangements of that sort in
                            regard to Israel at one time. It tended to break down in practice. But I
                            would think it highly useful if we could have some kind of informal
                            understanding at least among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            members and perhaps some others that in this traffic-in-arms business we
                            should try to keep each other informed so that the aggregate amounts are
                            not too excessive.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: Do you think you
                            would be in a position to get at least a statement from them in specific
                            terms against the use of force, not tacking it onto any tranche of arms
                            that you were providing them with?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: We have, of course gotten a lot of
                            these, and I don’t attach a great deal of importance to those things.
                            Whenever they get anything from us, they have to get it under the terms
                            of the conventional agreements that state they must not use the arms for
                            any aggressive purposes. And we have obtained statements from them that
                            they would not use it against West New Guinea and the like. I don’t
                            attach a great deal of value to those statements. Even among the more
                            reliable countries, France for example, we have had agreements which
                            would preclude use of arms in Algeria; but to stop them once they get
                            these arms and their political policy calls for them—they go ahead and
                            use them. They are not dependable.</p>
                        <p>I think the most dependable thing is, in fact, the dependence of the
                            country upon us, so that it will not commit any action which would
                            seriously disrupt that relationship. Certainly any act of force against
                            West New Guinea would seriously disrupt our relationship there, and they
                            know that very well. If they only got help from one side, the Communist
                            side, they then wouldn’t mind at all whether they disrupt it. They would
                            not have any relations to disrupt. It would not be a factor.</p>
                        <p>Allen, do you want to comment on this Indonesian situation? I know you
                            have given it a great deal of thought.</p>
                        <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0315"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>: I have here
                            certain figures on the aid that we discussed this morning. The economic
                            aid granted is about $200 million from the Soviet bloc. This is the
                            Sino-Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSH1">Beale</persName>: Are you speaking
                            of arms aid now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>: No; this is just
                            economic aid. I will come to the other in just a moment. The amount
                            obligated so far is about $118 million. Now, a good deal of that has not
                            reached Indonesia. For example, there is a block here of $40 million
                            from Poland for shipping. A good deal of this is shipping, and it has
                            not reached Indonesia and will not reach it for some time. It is much
                            more difficult to give amounts as to the arms aid, but it probably is in
                            excess of $100 million. A great deal of that is from, supposedly,
                            Czechoslovakia. It may be furnished by Russia. About $63 million of it
                            is in aircraft, including about 35 <gloss target="#t_MiG1"
                            >MIG</gloss>–17’s, 20-to–30 IL–28’s, 20 IL–14 transports, 20 <gloss
                                target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss>–15 jet trainers, and some helicopters.
                            Of this, however, only a relatively small part appears to have been
                            delivered as of a few weeks ago. About six of the jet fighters, six to
                            eight of the jet bombers, 15 of the jet trainers have been delivered.
                            Now, there have been agreements with Poland, also, with regard to four
                            destroyers and two submarines. It is quite extensive; it may be almost
                            massive.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: You, too, have
                            come around to “massive.” (Laughter)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>: On the side of
                            technicians, we estimate that they have about 270 bloc technicians on
                            the economic side and about 130 technicians on the military side, or a
                            total of about 400.</p>

                        <p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>: We do not
                            estimate that they are at the moment planning military operations.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: But you will get
                            some advance, possibly considerably advance knowledge of their
                            plans?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>: I would think we
                            would. We ought to. I would hope so. We ought to get some advance
                            warning.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: Have you anything from the
                            standpoint of the question that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NW2"
                                >Nash</persName> put: Is it worthwhile for the Dutch to hold on
                            here? What is the answer to that question?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: What is that?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: Is it worthwhile for the Dutch to
                            hold onto it? Are they getting anything out of it?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: No. They are
                            putting an equivalent of seven or eight million pounds into it each
                            year. They haven’t any chance of getting any dividends out of it.</p>
                        <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0316"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>: They told me the
                            other day it was close to $20 million U.S. dollars. I hadn’t known it
                            was as high as that.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>:Close. Their oil is
                            not impressive there and I believe it is declining, so it is likely to
                            be a sink for money.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: I think it seems to me that the
                            danger we need to face there is perhaps more the danger that the Dutch
                            would pull out than the danger that the Indonesians will take it by
                            force. Of the two dangers, I reckon that danger as greater, because, as
                            I understand it, a lot of their business people realize that this issue
                            is poisoning their relations and (depriving them of the) opportunity to
                            get their property back or at least to get some compensation for their
                            (lost) business in Indonesia and at least to start up business again.
                            There is quite a lot of pressure from the business people to say, “Why
                            in the world don’t we give this wretched business away and start fresh
                            and build our relationship with Indonesia.” And from a purely business
                            point of view, that makes a lot of sense, and the Dutch have a great
                            reputation for being pretty hardheaded about these things rather than
                            sentimental. And I would imagine that while at the moment they are quite
                            emotional about this one issue, that one must anticipate that their
                            attitude will change and that they may be disposed to just let this
                            thing go, realizing that there is more in it for them if they can
                            reestablish their good relations with Indonesia and get some of their
                            property back and get business going again rather than to hold onto this
                            wretched affair (West New Guinea) which is going to cost them more money
                            if they are going to have to get ready to defend it against possible
                            armed attack.</p>
                        <p>And of course you know I have talked about giving logistical support and
                            perhaps even more support—that is only possible if the fellow primarily
                            involved is himself willing to fight for it. A foreign country can’t
                            come in and fight for the territory of another country which isn’t
                            willing to do anything about it itself. So aid that we could give, or
                            maybe that you could give, even though you are not directly involved,
                            would be largely dependent upon their making an effort and their
                            willingness to fight. If they are not willing, we would be out.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName>: At the moment they
                            are not only willing but determined to resist any aggression—at the
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>: I think they are at the
                            moment.</p>

                        <p>The President recalled that he had last met Foreign Minister <persName

                                Government meeting, held in Paris December 16–19, 1957. No record
                                has been found of a conversation between <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                    >Eisenhower</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                    >Luns</persName>.</note> Although the meeting was intended to be
                            quite informal and non-substantive, the discussion immediately turned to
                            Dutch New Guinea when the President asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> for his views. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> stressed the difficulty that the
                            government in the Netherlands is experiencing in terms of public opinion
                            because of their effort to maintain a moderate attitude toward the
                            United States on this matter. He said he and the government fully
                            understood the United States position—of avoiding actions which would
                            drive the Indonesians into the arms of the Soviets. Certain types of
                            arms the United States is supplying the Indonesians, however, cause a
                            great deal of concern. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YP1"
                                >Young</persName> confirmed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> and the government had been extremely understanding
                            in this matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said
                            that the Indonesians of course have no claim on Dutch New Guinea, since
                            the natives are non-Indonesian, and strongly desire to stay free of the
                            Indonesians. The land is very lightly settled, however, and the
                            possibility exists of the Indonesians making small landings at various
                            places. He felt that a “deterrent” in the form of a joint
                            Dutch-Australian statement would be very important and hoped that the
                            United States would support that.</p>
                        <p>The President commented with regard to the limited amounts of arms being
                            furnished the Indonesians, that many of these require ammunition and
                            spare parts in order to be effectively utilized, and that this gives us
                            a degree of control over their misuse; also, any recipient must
                            undertake not to use the arms for aggressive purposes.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that we have recently been stressing very strongly
                            in the Far East the principle of “no territorial expansion by force of
                            arms.” He asked whether this would not have application in
                            Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>The President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> next
                            discussed Dutch New Guinea in more detail, as to population, area,
                            economic development, etc. The President asked what value Dutch New
                            Guinea had to the Dutch. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            said that it does not have much real value, but that the Dutch feel they
                            have an obligation to administer and protect it. He added that other
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members should honor this
                            feeling.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would talk in more detail to the Secretary of State
                            regarding this matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2"><persName

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                    >Dillon</persName></hi>: The decision taken on 1 August 1958 to
                            implement the token military aid programs for Indonesia was based, among
                            other things, upon an estimate that: (1) The Indonesian Army is the only
                            non-Communist force in Indonesia with the capability of obstructing the
                            progress of the Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>) toward domination of the country, and (2) given some
                            encouragement in the form of <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0319"
                            />U.S. aid, Indonesian Army Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> will carry out his plans for the control of
                            Communism. Therefore, the bulk of the equipment programmed is intended
                            for the Indonesian Army, but will be paralleled by some assistance to
                            the other Services.</p>
                        <p>The first shipments under this token program commenced arriving in
                            Djakarta on 15 August. There is evidence through official channels that
                            the reaction in Indonesian political and military circles was very
                            favorable. An initial momentum has thus been gained, and it is important
                            that this momentum be maintained.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that there are risks and uncertainties ahead in pursuing
                            our current policy. Indeed, by its magnitude the comparison to the
                            massive economic and military aid Indonesia has already received from
                            Bloc countries, the token military aid program could hardly be expected
                            to produce more than that which has already been accomplished—plus an
                            opportunity for personal association between U.S. and Indonesian
                            military personnel. However, it is the view of the Department of Defense
                            that the token military aid program, by creating a momentum in Indonesia
                            favorable to the United States, is accomplishing the purpose for which
                            it was designed. What is important now is to maintain this momentum with
                            further actions designed to convince General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and the anti-Communist
                            Indonesian politicians that the United States can be depended upon for
                            continued support in return for further moves on their part to curb the
                            Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense recognizes the sensitivity of the Netherlands
                            to military assistance to Indonesia, and the staunch support of the
                            United States by the Dutch both in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and the United Nations. Yet continued delay in our Indonesia program
                            because of Dutch objections may readily result in the deterioration of
                            our position in Indonesia and the ascendancy of the Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>Under other circumstances the Department of Defense would recommend the
                            establishment of a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> organization in
                            Indonesia. However, in view of the difficulties discussed above
                            concerning the impact of this program on our relations with the
                            Netherlands, as well as the desire of the Indonesian Government to keep
                            the program on an informal basis, the continuation of military
                            assistance to Indonesia should be at the present time by means other
                            than a formal program. Such arrangements should not preclude the
                            eventual establishment of a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that appropriate arrangements be made for conducting a
                            continuing program of military assistance for Indonesia informally,
                            although on an unclassified basis. Delivery of U.S. equipment <pb
                                n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0320"/>could then continue to be
                            supervised by qualified U.S. military personnel, but their operations
                            should be conducted with minimum publicity.</p>
                        <p>In light of the above considerations, the Department of Defense
                            recommends:</p>

                                Guinea, he was enclosing a draft statement. The letter and the draft
                                statement are <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 756D.00/10–758. See
                                Supplement.</note>
                            <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0321"/>The Secretary said he thought
                            that the statement met the points in which he understood Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> was interested. We had really
                            tried to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>After reading the statement, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van
                                Roijen</persName> said that the first thought which occurred to him
                            was what would the United States do if Indonesia did in fact use force
                            against New Guinea. The Secretary replied that he could not give an
                            advance commitment on what we would do if force were used without prior
                            consultation with Congress and Congressional authorization. However, he
                            could say that if force were used, the Dutch could undoubtedly count on
                            our following the same pattern in dealing with that situation as we have
                            followed in comparable cases elsewhere. However, since it was not
                            possible at this time to get Congressional authorization, he could not
                            make a formal statement to that effect. He recalled that the United
                            States had acted vigorously to prevent territorial shifts by force. He
                            said that our action in Lebanon, although it was primarily directed
                            against indirect aggression, was an example of what he meant. He had
                            told the Israelis, who had also sought advance commitments in the event
                            force should be used against them, that they could take comfort from our
                            actions in Lebanon. The Secretary said that in cases where we have taken
                            military action we have had advance Congressional preparation and
                            sanction. He did not doubt that we would help the Netherlands to the
                            limit of our legal authority, but he could not put that in the
                            statement. He believed that the statement, as now drafted, provided a
                            good indication to the Netherlands and to Indonesia what our attitude
                            would be with respect to the use of force.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> agreed that
                            the statement clearly set forth our interest and concern with respect to
                            the West New Guinea situation but he said that it was as if we were
                            merely saying that we were against sin. He had doubts whether the
                            statement would serve to quiet the fears which exist in the Netherlands,
                            particularly in the Labor Party, that the Netherlands stands alone with
                            respect to West New Guinea. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van
                                Roijen</persName> recalled to the Secretary the background of the
                            resolution on West New Guinea recently introduced into the Netherlands
                            Parliament by the Labor Party<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Reference is
                                to the so-called Burger motion, introduced in the Dutch Second
                                Chamber on September 30 by representative J.A.W. Burger. The motion
                                called for consultations with a number of friendly powers concerning
                                the feasibility of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship
                                for West New Guinea.</note> and said that although the resolution
                            had been defeated, the Labor Party had fully supported it. The Secretary
                            said that he thought that the statement carried the clear implication
                            that the Dutch do not stand alone with regard to West New Guinea. He
                            stated that many people in Europe do not seem to realize that the
                            Executive in this country is much less free than in other countries to
                            make promises or <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0322"/>take action in
                            the absence of Congressional authorization or sanction. He said that at
                            the time of the Suez situation the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            could not have acted militarily because there was no Congressional
                            approval. He recalled that there had been considerable controversy over
                            the legal authority of the Truman administration to act with respect to
                            Korea. He said that although nobody disagreed with the action itself,
                            there were those who felt that no action should have been taken until
                            Congress had been consulted and had approved. He said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> might be termed
                            “conservative” in relation to this point since he was most reluctant to
                            give promises which might strain the Presidential authority. The
                            Secretary stressed that we have always made our opposition to the use of
                            force recognized by more than mere words of condemnation. We have always
                            acted on the principle that force should not be used to settle disputes
                            and he recalled the strong diplomatic stand we took at the time of Suez
                            against our two oldest allies. The Secretary said that it would be
                            unthinkable that we would not do something if force were used against
                            West New Guinea, but he emphasized again that he could not make a formal
                            statement to this effect without Presidential approval, and he did not
                            think the President would give his approval without Congressional
                            sanction.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that he
                            thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> would have
                            to explain the background set forth by the Secretary to the Foreign
                            Affairs Commission of the Netherlands Parliament in private sessions. He
                            did not think that the statement by itself without the private
                            explanation would suffice. He said that the real problem was that there
                            were those in the Netherlands who felt that West New Guinea should be
                            given up. He thought that a serious situation would be created if
                            pressures in the Netherlands to give up West New Guinea should increase.
                            The Secretary agreed that if the Dutch should give up West New Guinea, a
                            serious problem would be created, especially if <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> should go to the
                            Communists. He said that Australia would be particularly concerned in
                            view of the importance of New Guinea to Australian security.</p>

                        <p>The Netherlands Government fears that Indonesia will attempt to take West
                            New Guinea by force and is strongly opposed to Indonesian acquisition of
                            arms and military equipment from any Western source. Failing a complete
                            embargo, the Dutch request that the U.S. supply no “offensive” arms and
                            ask its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners to refrain from
                            selling arms to Indonesia. The Australian Government, both for internal
                            political reasons and because of Dutch pressure, has expressed concern
                            over U.S. supply of “offensive weapons,” but is in basic agreement with
                            present U.S. policy. The British Government, although not prepared to
                            sell heavy military equipment to Indonesia “at this time”, has informed
                            the Indonesians it will sell them some radar equipment. The Germans have
                            also recently informed the Indonesians that they are going ahead with
                            the delivery of some speedboats for the Navy.</p>

                        <p>The recent trend in developments in Indonesia has been in general

                            assured Secretary Indo does not want communism. In past GOI unable
                            openly oppose communist bloc or adopt anti-communist policy because such
                            policy would have led to anarchy. Now however possible for GOI take
                            stronger stand. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                            remarked <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> no longer
                            popular with communists who regard President as principal competitor for
                            loyalty of masses. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as
                            well as military having greater voice in daily operations of government.
                            FonMin stated Indo must find solution to many of its problems while
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> still alive and
                            serving as unifying force. Government must also find ways for
                            administering country without retreating from elections. Secretary
                            emphasized <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> dedicated to principles,
                            not alliances or friendships, and cited <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> position on Suez. Re newly independent former colonies
                            such as Indonesia Secretary said our concern not merely that
                            independence be obtained but that once obtained it be preserved. One of
                            policies of international communism is to promote concept of
                            independence to point of breaking relations of colonial people with
                            West, then after independence move in and consolidate strength. Danger
                            in Far East, Secretary noted, is growing mood of expansion in Communist
                            China and desire dominate area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary stated until recently we felt GOI not aware communist dangers
                            and therefore might lose independence and remarked that some of
                            revolutionary elements more aware these dangers than central <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0328"/>government. Secretary said we did
                            nothing to help them but we did nothing to stop others from rendering
                            assistance. We now believe, Secretary said, GOI more aware of dangers
                            and this tends create better relationship between us. As long as Indo
                            alert to dangers and is taking steps counter them, Indo will have
                            nothing but sympathy and support from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            and no basis to fear us. Indo will never be under pressure join <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> but we do wish see Indo remain
                            independent. If it seems Indo slipping into communist hands then we
                            would see what steps necessary help Indonesia preserve independence.
                            Secretary summarized <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> views as 1) we
                            have no ambition run Indo, force Indo adopt our policies or align itself
                            with us; 2) our one concern is that action be taken by GOI to maintain
                            independence; 3) as long as Indo does that, there will be no basic
                            differences between us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary acknowledged situation complicated somewhat by West New Guinea
                            issue but stated our attitude toward Indonesia would not be altered or
                            swayed by our friendship with the Netherlands. Secretary reiterated we
                            abide by principles, however unpopular they might be. We assume
                            therefore that Indo will also adhere to its principles and not resort to
                            use force for settlement its territorial claims. Re use of force,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> replied Indo
                            realized such action not only against Dutch or even Australia but
                            against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and he could assure Secretary
                            Indo will never take action against <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> added that while
                            his government would not be so foolish as to use force, GOI wanted
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to be more constructive in helping
                            find solution. Secretary replied he thought there might be opportunity
                            do something in future but that at present feelings on both sides too
                            emotional.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said also we do not like GOI policy of wholesale confiscation,
                            that it is bad policy to treat property in such a way that it frightens
                            everybody away. Secretary emphasized he raising this issue not because
                            he was talking as agent of Dutch but rather because of its general
                            importance re Indo relations with West. Secretary remarked that when
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> nationalized Suez he
                            was careful to say there would be fair compensation. In reply <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> recalled fruitless
                            negotiations with Dutch on West New Guinea issue since 1950 indicating
                            Indo-Dutch relations had played into hands of communists and implying
                            this forced current GOI measures against Dutch. Stated proposed
                            legislation did not provide for confiscation but for nationalization.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> added GOI had no
                            intention of cutting off economic relations completely with Dutch and
                            declared recent developments Indo-Dutch relations a tragedy. However
                            Indo did not wish isolate itself from West. Now that <gloss

                            countries together this would be helpful.</p>

                            remarked in Indo there was great respect for its material progress,
                            albeit at expense human lives, but also <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303"
                                facs="0329"/>great fear. FonMin added there was not one person in
                            Indo afraid of attack on Indo by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> but
                            growing awareness of danger of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"

                            declared one of great problems faced by Indo is resident Chinese and
                            defended GOI actions against them. He tended fail differentiate between

                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made strong appeal last
                            night to <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Director Baird to help
                            convey true picture of Indonesia to American Government on his return to
                            Washington. President asked Baird to call on eve of his departure for
                            Washington consultation, first time Baird had talked with President on
                            other than primarily social occasions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> expressed hope that
                            improvement Indo-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations could
                            continue. Baird remarked that he felt relations had improved during last
                            six months, and President replied, “Oh, tremendously. But we want this
                            to continue. We always have the feeling you are holding back and not
                            giving us your full confidence. We are peculiar people. If you give us
                            your full confidence, you will be surprised how we will respond.”</p>
                        <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>President went on to say he had told Secretary two years ago “not to lose
                            this game”.</p>
                        <p>“These fellows up north are pretty rough,” <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> added. “We don’t know how
                            many friends we have in the world. We don’t know whether you are really
                            for us; we have the feeling that your aid comes to us reluctantly.</p>
                        <p>“We have more basic things in common with America than any other country.
                            Please don’t lose this game.”</p>
                        <p>President then turned to specifics, noting that press reports had said
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> informed in
                            Washington <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank unwilling make
                            loans for Lockheed Electras, thermal power plant in Surabaya,
                            dredges.</p>
                        <p>“This is vital. We have to have these things. I don’t understand. Why are
                            you so reluctant to help us. We like Americans and we trust America, but
                            we have got to survive. Try to explain this in Washington and get these
                            loans through. We were embarrassed by this.”</p>
                        <p>President’s attitude throughout conversation was friendly, sincere,
                            humble. At one point said he was angry about <hi rend="italic">Herald
                                Tribune</hi> editorial which had accused him of staging trip to
                            Moluccas to divert attention from serious economic situation.</p>
                        <p>“I don’t know why we’re so misunderstood,” President said. “We don’t seem
                            to have projected ourselves as we really are.</p>
                        <p>“I have received many, many letters from your young people in the States
                            who are more understanding of Indonesia’s needs and aspirations than
                            your government.”</p>
                        <p>The President then undertook to analyze the cause for <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>“The center of world power and influence has shifted since World War II
                            to Asia from Europe. You are still guided by a European mentality in
                            your attitude and relations with Asia generally, but in particular
                            towards the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>“Why is it that most of the visitors who come here have a completely
                            false picture of Indonesia in their minds? But after even two days in
                            Djakarta, the worst city in the world, they understand us better and see
                            that they have been wrong. Please do not lose this game because of such
                            false attitudes.”</p>
                        <p>At another point in conversation President asked whether “Dutch
                            propaganda” might be responsible for distorted picture of Indonesia in
                            outside world.</p>

                                target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. I saw <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at 10 o’clock this morning,
                            he having postponed appointment tentatively scheduled for eighteenth
                            because he was not feeling well. President had three-hour examination by
                            doctors yesterday and he has been ordered to take complete rest. He
                            therefore will leave for 10 days in Bali end of this week returning
                            December 4.</p>
                        <p>President opened conversation by asking me whether I had recovered from
                            rigors of trip to East Indonesia. I laughed and said I had after two or
                            three good nights sleep. I complimented him on his amazing energy and
                            stamina and said he certainly had not acted like a man who needed
                            medical attention. He admitted stimulation of trip helped not hurt him.
                            He had planned trip to Kalimantan on twenty-seventh of this month to
                            dedicate new airport but he had reluctantly cancelled this on insistence
                            of his doctors. He asked my impressions of trip. I replied that aside
                            from obvious beauty of Moluccas and attractiveness of gay, music-loving
                            people I had received two distinct impressions: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That people of Moluccas were genuine Indonesians and that they
                                    thought of themselves as Indos first and Moluccans second. This
                                    was significant since when I had been in Indonesia before I had
                                    heard much of separatist movement in Moluccas and anti-Javanese
                                    sentiment there. I said I presumed considerable anti-Javanese
                                    sentiment still exists (at this point President nodded
                                    agreement) but that it was evident from people with whom I had
                                    talked entirely aside from staged demonstrations that Moluccan
                                    people had become in spirit a part of a united Indonesia.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That President himself served as a symbol of this unity and
                                    that regardless of anti-Javanese feelings in eastern Indonesia
                                    these sentiments did not apply to President for whom obvious
                                    genuine affection had been manifested on all sides. I said that
                                    some observers in the party inclined at first to be skeptical
                                    were convinced by genuiness of his reception. President was
                                    right in what he had said on trip, I commented, and quoted his
                                    own words back to him “It is easy to arrange a meeting but one
                                    cannot prearrange a smile.”</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>President while apparently gratified at my comments seemed to be waiting
                            for me to say something else which I intentionally avoided saying, <pb
                                n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0335"/>that is comment on West New
                            Guinea aspect of trip. President, however, did not raise point but
                            instead turned to subject of another trip he had planned as soon as
                            various official visits such as that of President Tito, et cetera were
                            out of way. This would be trip to northern Sulawesi, he said, and
                            indicated he would include me in invitation.</p>
                        <p>President then referred to his conversation with Mister Baird last night
                            (Embtel 1695),<note n="1" xml:id="d166fn1"><ref target="#d165">Document
                                    165</ref>.</note> reviewed what he had told him and then
                            inquired whether I had seen press reports re no credit for Lockheed
                            Electras, Surabaya Power and Kalimantan Dredges. If so what did I think
                            about them.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I had seen press reports, that I had queried Washington as
                            to their significance which I said I failed to understand in view of
                            good news which I had come to impart. I then informed President in
                            accordance with authorization Deptel 925<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2"

                            to proceed. President expressed gratification at this news and
                            re-emphasized his concern re Lockheed Electras. It would be very
                            embarrassing if after all this time this request were turned down. Need
                            for these planes was very great but much more important at this point
                            was question of pride. I responded that I had had no official word which
                            would lead me to believe that this request had been rejected and I
                            counseled patience, pointing out that newspaper reports are often
                            misleading.</p>

                            that meeting.</p>
                        <p>President readily assented. He went on to say that he hoped the <gloss

                            British—that we would not feel it necessary to seek Dutch approval in
                            advance for anything we did for Indonesia. I assured him that as he by
                            now must be aware <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward
                            Indonesia stood on its own feet. President then expressed gratification
                            at this news. He also obviously appreciated my coming to him first
                            (although for Department’s information this was result of chance not of
                            planning since I had asked for appointments with PriMin and <persName

                            “gradually but quickly.” “It is important for it to come quickly.”<note

                            with Indonesian armed forces more fully and frankly than has heretofore
                            been possible our long range intentions re military assistance. If we do
                            not do so, we may find ourselves providing <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311"
                                facs="0337"/>considerable assistance piecemeal without accomplishing
                            our political objectives. This would be as unsatisfactory to Indonesians
                            as to ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I believe we should tell chiefs of armed services that so long as there
                            is no reversal in present favorable political trend in Indonesia <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intends furnish such quantities and types
                            of arms for all three services as it is able, consistent with other
                            assistance commitments, requirements of our own military services, and
                            limitation that only self-defense and internal security requirements are
                            to be met.</p>
                        <p>So far as Indonesian Army now knows we have translated offer of
                            additional military assistance into commitment provide 12 Bailey
                            bridges. While army is glad to have Bailey bridges, it will have
                            difficulty absorbing that quantity all at once. However, it could
                            immediately use large number additional rifles. Army’s immediate needs
                            change from time to time, and long gap between first request and actual
                            delivery may produce other such incongruities if we approach problem on
                            item by item basis.</p>
                        <p>Recently General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and his
                            deputies have informed <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> army
                            headquarters now giving low priority to proposed equipment in
                            augmentation program. They emphasize immediate need for small arms,
                            transportation and communications.</p>
                        <p>Natural resolution for such difficulty would be for Indonesian Army to
                            plan its requirements year or so ahead so <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> could make determinations well in advance as to items it
                            is willing or able to provide. This not now possible since army has no
                            assurances <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will be providing it with
                            any form of assistance year, or even month, from now. In any event it
                            could make no plans without knowing what <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> had available and might be willing to supply. So far
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid has been what the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has decided is best for Indonesia have.
                            Indonesian armed services do not believe they can make adequate long
                            range plans on that basis, especially since they have no clear idea of
                            what <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> thinks they should have in
                            future. It is inevitable that unless they can see a little farther into
                            future re our intentions, the services, particularly air force, will be
                            tempted to deal increasingly with Soviet bloc as a more satisfactory
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>We realize our present program is to proceed only as rapidly as we
                            receive signs that Indonesians are responding as we desire. While I
                            believe this has been valid approach, it can become self-defeating
                            because it prevents adequate planning and produces a situation in which
                            improvement of relations can only proceed by fits and starts.</p>
                        <p>There is much evidence that General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> taking on greatly increased share
                            responsibility for management Indonesian affairs, and it not beyond
                            realm of possibility this trend will continue to point where his
                            influence will be decisive on all questions. Therefore it is vital to
                            our <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0338"/>interest that we reinforce,
                            especially at this time, his confidence in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> willingness to see him through.</p>
                        <p>We need a definite plan as to approximate value and categories of weapons
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> prepared supply Indonesia annually
                            for period of years, subject to favorable political developments. This
                            plan should realistically take into account needs of services and fact
                            that items we cannot supply may be obtained elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>While it may take some time to develop such a plan, there are certain
                            steps we can take now to make it clear that we are prepared to go
                            farther in future.</p>

                            additional financing of $7.2 million. The total amount of the pending

                        <p>I believe that it is essential to the success of our policy in Indonesia
                            that we respond favorably and quickly to the Indonesian Army’s request
                            that we furnish this basic equipment for 20 infantry battalions. The
                            Army with a strength of about 200,000 men is a potent political force.
                            It is the only force in Indonesia which stands a reasonable chance of
                            being able to stem Communist advances and has made a start in this
                            direction. Compared to the Navy and the Air Force, the Army to date has
                            contracted for only relatively small quantities of military equipment
                            from the Soviet bloc. Our failure to respond favorably to the Army’s
                            request will weaken the position of the Army Chief of Staff <persName

                            and almost certainly force the Army to turn increasingly to the bloc as
                            a source of military supply. A favorable answer to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> would, on the other hand,
                            enable us at least for the next few months to retain and perhaps
                            increase our influence within the Army and our ability to encourage
                            internal Indonesian developments along a desirable course.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that his
                            Government was most anxious to get on with the exchange of military
                            information regarding Indonesia’s intentions and subsequently to proceed
                            to the next stage of secret military talks with United States and others
                            on what should be done if Indonesia should attack West New Guinea. The
                            Dutch Government felt that even though there was a difference between us
                            on the evaluation regarding Indonesian intentions, the possibility still
                            remained that aggression might occur. This aggression could be in a
                            variety of forms. He said that although his Government had mentioned, on
                            the basis of intelligence reports, March as a possible date for
                            Indonesian action against West New Guinea, his Government was not tying
                            itself to this date. His Government believed that we should proceed
                            without delay along the above lines, since this was the minimum which
                            could be done so that the necessary precautions might be taken against
                            Indonesian action.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that another
                            important point was the building up of a public deterrent against
                            Indonesian action. The Dutch believed that the statement which the
                            Secretary gave to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> in
                            October had been useful in this respect, although it had not gone far
                            enough. The Ambassador said that his Government was also anxious to
                            obtain an open commitment of support from the United States. At the
                            present time Dutch public opinion was becoming restive, since it
                            believed that the Netherlands was isolated in its policy with respect to
                            Netherlands New Guinea. The Netherlands held on to New Guinea in the
                            interests of the West. However, it was increasingly difficult without
                            public recognition of this fact, by the United States and others, for
                            the Netherlands to follow this policy. In this connection he referred to
                            the possibility that the Labor Party might be in opposition after the
                            forthcoming elections and that this might complicate the present policy
                            with respect to West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that although
                            the paper on the Indonesian situation which the Ambassador had handed
                            him on December 22 was under study, we could not finalize our comments
                            until we had received the more detailed analysis which Mr. <persName

                            comments. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said
                            that he was unaware that an additional paper was under preparation in
                            The Hague.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said that although we
                            and the Dutch are in agreement on general objectives in connection with
                            Indonesia, we have from time to time disagreed with regard to tactics.

                            reliance on our effort to influence the Indonesian Government. He
                            recalled the strong statement which the Secretary had made to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> that the United States would
                            be opposed to the use of force by Indonesia against West New
                                Guinea.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">See <ref target="#d162">Document
                                    162</ref>.</note> There were, of course, great difficulties for
                            us in connection with military planning for an area which was not
                            covered by a treaty commitment. Any action on our part with respect to
                            such areas would be limited to self-defense or to an action pursuant to
                            a Security Council resolution. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van
                                Roijen</persName> said he realized the difficulties involved for us
                            in this situation. The main thing was to build up a public deterrent so
                            that Indonesia will realize the grave consequences which would ensue if
                            it should undertake aggression. Even though we might not be able to
                            proceed as the Dutch desire, his Government believed that it was only
                            fair that we should be warned regarding the possibility of an attack
                            against West New Guinea.<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">The Department

                            said the reasons were political, economic and personal. I told the
                            President that I regretted I could not assure him that he would receive
                            the Electras but promised that I would report our conversation in full
                            to Washington. I emphasized that the DC–7 was an excellent aircraft and
                            pointed out that the Export-Import Bank has the duty of determining the
                            soundness of any project for which it loaned money, as is the case with
                            any bank. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked if

                            sell them and stated that Indonesia’s credit was good. He said, “we do
                            not want second hand aircraft, we want new aircraft”, these Electras we
                            have been talking about for so long. He said that he realized DC–7’s
                            were good but Electras were matter of prestige. He implied not only
                            Indonesia’s prestige but his personal prestige.</p>
                        <p>I explained the developments in Washington including Moekarto’s
                            exposition of Indonesian Government position.<note n="3"

                        <p>It was clear in this morning’s conversation that President cannot
                            understand our reluctance to sell Electras to Indonesia and that in his
                            eyes his own personal prestige as well as prestige his country involved.
                            This is most sensitive nerve. If our policy is to be successful,

                            leaders here must be convinced that Indonesia will receive support they

                            on New Guinea by insisting on answer to question as to whether <gloss

                            that area essential to free world interests.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0350"/>
                        <p>Whether or not Dutch do force issue this manner I believe time has come
                            to answer this question in clear negative. If we do so, we must of
                            course have alternative which would better serve free world interests
                            than continuation of status quo and at same time be compatible with
                            Dutch, Australian, Indonesian national interests.</p>
                        <p>In suggesting that time has come for Dutch to lay down admittedly heavy
                            burden West New Guinea, I do not imply that immediate acquisition of
                            sovereignty by Indonesia need be involved. On contrary, there could be
                            continuation free world control until such time as there no longer any
                            danger Indonesia passing under Communist domination.</p>
                        <p>This control could take many forms, such as a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> trusteeship with or without interested parties as
                            trustees; a consortium outside <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or even
                            unilateral <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> custodianship.</p>
                        <p>Important factor to obtain Indonesian cooperation, and thus remove issue
                            as political hand hold for Soviet Union, would be an immediate end Dutch
                            sovereignty and assurance that in long run there would be very good
                            possibility Indonesia obtaining sovereignty by peaceful means. Meanwhile
                            whoever assumed responsibility for area should be required prepare
                            population for self-determination in as brief period as possible—for
                            example five years—with provision for appropriate extension should this
                            prove be too short period for such preparation.</p>
                        <p>For their part Dutch would be relieved of burdensome responsibility and
                            most likely would be able obtain substantial compensation from Indonesia
                            for nationalized Dutch assets—this would be question of bargaining.
                            Australians would be protected against extension communism nearer their
                            boundaries, and a source friction with future power in this part of
                            world would have been removed in timely fashion.</p>
                        <p>My approach to whole problem is based on conviction that ultimately Dutch
                            will be forced relinquish West New Guinea in any event and that it is in
                            their interest as well as ours do so while some advantage may be gained
                            thereby.</p>
                        <p>Colonialism is finished and the longer we continue support small western
                            enclaves in Asia the longer we delay winning Asians to our cause, the
                            more we intensify danger of major explosion over minor issue.</p>
                        <p>Even if it be argued that transfer West Irian to Indonesia is to
                            substitute Asian for western colonialism, fact is that it is combination
                            of white west over colored east that Asians are fighting, rather than
                            imperialism or colonialism per se.</p>
                        <p>That Dutch withdrawal from the area is inevitable appears clear on other
                            grounds than fact colonialism is dead. These grounds are eloquently
                            stated in reference telegram—business and labor opposition, mounting
                            expense, fear of attack, lack of international support, et cetera.</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0351"/>
                        <p>While <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has given and must honor
                            assurances that [it] would stand with Holland in event Indonesian
                            aggression against New Guinea, it certainly in our interest that such
                            situation not arise. Presumably degree popular support among American
                            public for military defense New Guinea could hardly be classed as
                            enthusiastic.</p>
                        <p>In terms strategic importance New Guinea could not be classed with other
                            places in which free world has dug in, such as <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCJ1">Berlin</persName>, Okinawa or Taiwan. So far as
                            defense <gloss target="#t_ANZAM1">ANZAM</gloss> concerned, there are
                            several parts of Indonesian archipelago which would present more of a
                            threat to that area should they fall into unfriendly hands than would
                            New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Of course there are many practical problems in attempting work out such
                            solution as I have outlined. We should evaluate such difficulties in the
                            light of what it might be worth to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            free world to remove for all time principal anti-west issue in
                            Indonesian politics, to draw teeth of extreme nationalists and
                            Communists alike, to free Indonesia from political dependence on USSR,
                            to facilitate rapprochement between <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"
                                >ANZUS</gloss> and Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Certainly it cannot be said that such a solution as I have suggested
                            would damage Netherlands. On contrary our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> ally would be strengthened.</p>
                        <p>Thus I think our approach to Dutch at this time should be that while we
                            appreciate sacrifice they have so loyally made in defense of free world,
                            we cannot in all conscience ask them to continue longer, that we
                            prepared instead help them work out solution that will relieve them of
                            their burden and at same time obtain recompense from Indonesia for their
                            nationalized properties.</p>
                        <p>If there is to be a settlement this problem, there no other nation except
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> which has capability of taking
                            successful initiative.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of an unrelated subject.]</p>
                        <p>In Indonesia, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">[Allen] Dulles</persName>
                            stated that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            had been holding talks with Indonesian political leaders with respect to
                            the re-organization and expansion of the Indonesian Parliament in
                            keeping with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            concept of “guided democracy”. According to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s present plans, one-half
                            of the members of the Parliament would be appointed by the government
                            and one-half would be elected. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> thought
                            that such a proposal might not be bad inasmuch as he certainly could not
                            look forward, he confessed, to full and free elections in Indonesia with
                            so many disorganized parties on the political scene. Moreover, the
                            Indonesian Communist Party strongly opposed the government’s plan for
                            appointing one-half of the members of the new Parliament.</p>
                        <p>There were also reports from Indonesia that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was not at all well and was
                            suffering perhaps from a kidney ailment. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            thought that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might
                            wish to come to Walter Reed Hospital for surgery. In this connection he
                            noted that Prime Minister Sarit of Thailand would presently be operated
                            on again in Bangkok by physicians from Walter Reed. Sarit was a very
                            sick man indeed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then pointed out that the Indonesian Army
                            was continuing to play a very strong political role in Indonesia.
                            Meanwhile, extensive guerilla warfare went on in Sumatra and North
                            Celebes. There were approximately 10,000 armed rebels in Sumatra and
                            5,000 in North Celebes. In view of these facts it seemed curious to Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> that the Indonesian rebels had not done
                            better when they had a chance to fight in an organized way against the
                            forces sent from Java. We ourselves were not giving any aid to the
                            rebels although they seem to be getting some assistance from Nationalist
                            China.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether, if <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> were to succeed with his plans for “guided
                            democracy” and excluded the Communists from a significant voice in the
                            Parliament of Indonesia, these moves would tend to end the rebellion in
                            the outer islands? Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied that he <pb
                                n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0353"/>doubted that this would occur
                            unless <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could bring
                            himself to deal directly with the rebels. So far he has refused to do
                            this despite urgings by us and by the British. Meanwhile, the rebel
                            leaders, who included some of the most able men in Indonesia, were still
                            up in the hills. They were probably now ready to negotiate but <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> won’t hear of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> concluded by pointing out that
                            significant Soviet Bloc military aid to Indonesia was continuing.
                            Likewise, the economic situation in Indonesia was worsening and
                            inflation was increasing.</p>

                            in the course of his briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> referred to the problem of West New Guinea and to
                            the fact that the new policy recommended continuation of the U.S.
                            neutral stand on the West New Guinea issue, he called on Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> for comment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> observed that of course the trouble
                            in West New Guinea between The Netherlands and Indonesia was highly
                            complicated and involved both Dutch domestic policy and the foreign
                            policies of several <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations. The
                            present government of The Netherlands has hitherto taken a very strong
                            line with respect to holding on to West New Guinea. Since West New
                            Guinea, continued Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>, had <pb n="328"
                                xml:id="pg_328" facs="0354"/>no ascertainable value at the present
                            time, it seemed to him that the Dutch Government was paying a very high
                            price for maintaining prestige. The really useful Dutch investment had
                            been in Indonesia and this was now wiped out, at least temporarily.
                            Moreover, there was a considerable element in The Netherlands, notably
                            among Dutch businessmen, who felt that the policy of the present
                            government of The Netherlands on the West New Guinea issue was
                            silly.</p>
                        <p>Reiterating that West New Guinea, so far as was known, was pretty nearly
                            valueless, Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> did not discount the
                            possibility of a change in the policy of The Netherlands toward West New
                            Guinea. While this might be hopeful, it should be remembered that
                            Australia was even more violently opposed than The Netherlands to
                            turning over West New Guinea to the Indonesians. For our part, we have
                            made quite clear to the Indonesians that if they should attempt to seize
                            West New Guinea by force, the U.S. would be strongly opposed in
                            principle. We have also told the Dutch that in the event that West New
                            Guinea were attacked by the Indonesians, we would at least give them
                            moral and perhaps logistical support although we would not support them
                            with our own military forces. Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            added a statement of doubt that the Indonesians would actually move
                            against West New Guinea with armed forces.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> stated that the
                            government of The Netherlands was in a very delicate and difficult
                            position with respect to this dispute and as Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> had pointed out in his briefing,
                            the Dutch have lately been putting heavier pressure on the U.K. than on
                            the U.S. to obtain support for their point of view with regard to West
                            New Guinea. Nevertheless, the British stand approximately where we stand
                            on the West New Guinea issue and while they may provide the Dutch with
                            moral and logistical support, they are not likely to take military
                            action to support the Dutch, if the Indonesians attacked West New
                            Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Quarles said he wished to point out that from the point of view
                            of Defense, he strongly supported the State position of neutrality on
                            the West New Guinea dispute. Mr. Quarles commented that in the course of
                            his recent talks at The Hague, he had observed that the Dutch were
                            taking the possibility of an Indonesian attack on West New Guinea very
                            seriously and were diverting military forces to the defense of West New
                            Guinea even though such resources were needed to discharge Holland’s
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> responsibilities. Secretary
                            Quarles added that the Dutch were much annoyed at the military
                            assistance which we were currently providing to Indonesia. In response
                            to these expressions of irritation, Secretary Quarles had pointed out
                            our big objective of trying to prevent a Communist take-over in
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0355"/>
                        <p>With respect to this last point, Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>
                            said that the Dutch Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> had said he would rather have Indonesia go
                            Communist because then one could more clearly move against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> pointed out that
                            while we knew very little about the West New Guinea area, we would
                            presently have on hand a report of what has been going on in the area in
                            recent months.</p>
                        <p>The President complained that he simply could not understand why any
                            nation except Australia should be very concerned about West New Guinea.
                            Australia was obviously concerned because of geographical proximity.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> continued
                            with his briefing of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5901 and
                            pointed out after he had dealt with the Financial Appendix, that the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff had expressed some concern about the apparent lack
                            of urgency in carrying out our military assistance program for
                            Indonesia. He called on <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral
                                Burke</persName> who was Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff to comment on this matter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> explained that the
                            concern of the Joint Chiefs of Staff resulted from the fact that in the
                            past eight or nine months the U.S. has slowly been pulling Indonesia out
                            of the clutches of the Communists, chiefly through the instrumentality
                            of the Army Chief of Staff, General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>. The Chiefs were only concerned that this
                            process continue and that we keep the ball rolling and not destroy
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> or weaken him by
                            not keeping up to schedule with our military assistance.</p>
                        <p>At this point Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> undertook a general
                            defense of the U.S. policy with respect to supporting the rebellion in
                            the outer islands while it seemed to have some chance of success and
                            withdrawing our support at a later time. By and large, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>], Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> believed that
                            we had played the game pretty well and our policy may now work out
                            successfully. He said he certainly did not dissent from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>’s views as to the need
                            for an effective military assistance program in order to win the
                            confidence of the non-Communist elements in Indonesia. The delays which
                            had occurred in the delivery of our military assistance to the
                            Indonesians were the result of the need in which we found ourselves to
                            keep the Dutch in line. To do this was often a difficult task but we
                            must at least try to keep the Dutch tolerant of what we are doing to
                            assist Indonesia. Ultimately, thought Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>, the Dutch will understand and acquiesce
                            in our program for assisting Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>The President did not seem wholly convinced by Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ arguments in defense of prior U.S.
                            policy except as he said that we were on a better horse now than we had
                            been during the organized rebellion in the outer islands.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>On this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            commented that a forceful reduction now of rebel guerilla activity in
                            the outer islands would provide <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> with a measure of freedom of action which might
                            not be wholly to our advantage. On the other hand, the rebels certainly
                            had not shown the competence necessary to take over Indonesia for
                            themselves. Accordingly, we were placed in a very delicate and difficult
                            situation. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> expressed the hope that the
                            new policy statement would not prevent the U.S. from providing small
                            arms to the rebels later if this appeared to be a desirable action. The
                            President paraphrased Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName>’s comment by stating that he was advocating that
                            we play with both sides.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">George Allen</persName> pointed to the
                            fact that on Page 21 of the Financial Appendix to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5901, the program of the U.S.I.A.
                            (information services) was listed under Assistance Programs. He
                            explained that he was somewhat astonished to find the U.S.I.A. program
                            described as “an Assistance” Program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> pointed out that the Financial Appendix did not
                            describe the U.S.I.A. program as such as an Assistance Program. The
                            program was merely listed in a table which covered the estimated costs
                            of carrying out our policies toward Indonesia. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then said he judged that the
                            National Security Council recommended approval of the policy in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5901. The President said this seemed to
                            be the case and while this seemed to be a policy of walking a tightrope,
                            he could see no other solution to the West New Guinea dispute. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> pointed out that
                            Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> should in effect be permitted to
                            walk the tightrope as best he could. The President, however, suggested
                            that the Dutch were such very good friends of ours and such good allies
                            that we should try to win them over to our point of view. Commenting on
                            the warm personal relationships he had enjoyed with Dutch friends, he
                            was sure that we could find some way to influence them. He commented
                            that perhaps Australia was a harder nut to crack than The

                                men, with no hoopla. He added Dutch had refrained from saying

                            <item>On subject of continuing British arms sales to Indo, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> stated that in his opinion
                                present conservative government was so scared of criticism by Labor
                                Party and of unemployment issue that it could not forbid commercial
                                contracts between British arms manufacturers and Indos. <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, however, would not seek any orders
                                from Indo and regarded arms shipments to Indo as purely commercial
                                operation. Nonetheless <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                                said <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> made it very
                                clear to him, and promised also to make it clear to Labor Party
                                leaders, that in permitting such arms sales <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                    >UK</gloss> assumed very definite responsibility and obligation
                                re their use. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> went on to
                                make one of most extreme statements he has made to date re Dutch
                                position on this matter. He told <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
                                    >Lloyd</persName> if Dutch were to find themselves alone on New
                                Guinea issue and could not count on any real assistance, then “there
                                would be one less partner in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>”.
                                While this is obviously a “ Lunsism”, it reflects Dutch Government’s
                                feeling that it should receive same support from its allies that it
                                gives them in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</item>

                                added that both he and British had heard that Indos were prepared to

                            <item>I asked <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> how he now
                                viewed possible <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> discussion of
                                this whole situation. He said <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
                                    >Lloyd</persName> would go along with Dutch suggestion that only
                                those countries should supply arms to Indo which could “guarantee
                                their use”. I attempted to get more accurate interpretation or
                                definition of this phrase but <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                    >Luns</persName> would go no further in describing what he had
                                in mind, if he knew himself. He did state that he expected British

                                    >NAC</gloss> which would be presented at same time as <gloss

                            <item>It seems to me two things are important in this connection: First,
                                close coordination with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on its
                                statement; and, secondly, opportunity for <persName

                        <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. The chief danger confronting U.S. policy with respect to Indonesia is
                            that a combination of domestic instability, Sino-Soviet Bloc economic
                            and military aid, and growing local Communist strength may lead to a
                            Communist takeover or to a policy increasingly friendly toward the
                            Sino-Soviet Bloc on the part of whatever regime is in power. The size
                            and importance of Indonesia, together with its strategic position <pb
                                n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0361"/>in relation to Australia and
                            Free Asia, and the probable serious consequences of its loss to
                            Communist control, dictate a vigorous U.S. effort to prevent these
                            contingencies.</p>
                        <p>2. Basically, any non-Communist Indonesian regime likely to come to power
                            will desire to follow a “neutralist” policy, seeking aid on its own
                            terms from both the West and the Bloc and balancing each off against the
                            other. It is unlikely that any foreseeable non-Communist regime will
                            depart from this basic policy, even though there is growing concern
                            among Indonesians, including the Army, over growing Communist strength
                            and the extent of aid accepted from the Bloc. Many Indonesian leaders
                            remain suspicious of Western motives. These leaders, preoccupied with
                            colonialism, have found in the Western European attitude towards Cyprus,
                            Algeria, and Arab nationalism, as well as towards the West New Guinea
                            issue, strong grounds for such suspicion of Western motives. Formal
                            political commitments to the West would constitute in their minds
                            unacceptable abridgement of their international freedom of action; and
                            regional military security pacts are opposed on the grounds that they
                            sharpen rather than reduce international tension.</p>
                        <p>3. Indonesia has certain advantages and points of strength. It shares no
                            common boundary with a Communist state. Although the Indonesians have an
                            extremely low per capita income, a salubrious climate and fertile soil
                            make the crushing poverty and starvation characteristic of some Asian
                            nations unknown in Indonesia. A predominantly subsistence economy
                            cushions most Indonesians from adverse commercial and financial
                            developments. While there is severe overpopulation on Java and much
                            “shared poverty,” absentee landlordism and glaring inequalities in land
                            distribution are almost unknown. The Dutch implanted in Indonesia a
                            strong respect for legal processes and the rule of law. Western concepts
                            of individual freedom and democratic government introduced by the Dutch
                            found a parallel in the democratic structure of the Indonesian village
                            and the Indonesian tradition of compromise and collective
                            decision-making.</p>
                        <p>4. On the other hand, Indonesia was ill-prepared to face the problems and
                            assume the responsibilities of independence. The educational policy of
                            the colonial regime prevented the development of an indigenous civil
                            service and a corps of trained professional men. Dutch economic policy
                            militated against the growth of an Indonesian entrepreneurial class.
                            Dutch policy of regarding all political activity as subversive prevented
                            the acquisition of a healthy political experience and a knowledge and
                            understanding of political techniques, and left in their stead a
                            tradition of negativism and irresponsible obstructionism. Finally, Dutch
                            administrative policies tended to preserve and accentuate regional and
                            ethnic differences.</p>

                        <p>5. The Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1"

                            and well-led. It is unique among Indonesian political parties in its
                            discipline, unity of purpose, and command of the techniques of political
                            action. It also dominates the Indonesian labor movement through its
                            labor federation, <gloss target="#t_SOBSI1">SOBSI</gloss>, and its
                            electoral strength is particularly concentrated in central and east
                            Java. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, which has capitalized on
                            internecine quarrels, venality, and incompetence in the non-Communist
                            parties, demonstrated in 1957 and 1958 local elections its steadily
                            increasing popular support. If the election scheduled originally for
                            1959 had been held, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would
                            probably have emerged as the largest party in Indonesia and would have
                            been in a strong position to demand cabinet representation. However this
                            election has now been postponed for at least one year. The party has
                            established itself in a strong psychological position by refraining from
                            overt extra-legal activities, strongly supporting the governments
                            recently in power, and more recently backing vigorously President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and endorsing the
                            government’s military action against the rebels. At the same time, it is
                            free of any responsibility for government failures and inadequacies
                            since it has not been formally represented in any cabinet. Open measures
                            of repression against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would be
                            difficult to justify on internal political grounds, and would expose any
                            government undertaking them to charges of truckling to Western pressure.
                            At present the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> probably lacks the
                            resources to seize power by overt force, and postponement of the
                            elections may delay a bid for power via the polls. However, there is a
                            serious and continuing danger that Indonesia may fall to Communism
                            through government inadequacy, Communist subversion, legal political
                            means, or, as a last resort, by violence.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> efforts have been complemented in
                            the external field by the Sino-Soviet Bloc, which since September 1956
                            offered Indonesia about $350,000,000 in military and economic credits,
                            under which arms and military equipment were provided when Western
                            sources were denied; vigorously espoused Indonesia’s claim to West New
                            Guinea; and gave diplomatic support during the difficult days of the
                            recent rebellion.</p>
                        <p>7. During recent months some non-Communist leaders and political parties
                            have demonstrated a greater realization of the Communist danger facing
                            their country, and appear more willing than before to cooperate among
                            themselves and with the Army to give Indonesia a more effective
                            government and check the growth of Communist strength and influence. The
                            non-Communist political parties are at present overshadowed by the Army,
                            the President, and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as major
                            power factors in <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0363"/>Indonesia.
                            While they won approximately 75 percent of the total vote in the 1957
                            election, they are faction-ridden and sharply divided among themselves.
                            They represent nonetheless a significant element of Indonesian society
                            seeking to steer a course between military dictatorship on the one hand
                            and Communist dictatorship on the other. As such, they are presently
                            exercising some stabilizing influence, and to the extent that they are
                            able to reconcile and subordinate their inter-party differences, they
                            could, with the backing of the Army, turn the tide against the Communist
                            party in the political field.</p>
                        <p>8. The non-Communist posture of the Indonesian Government is now
                            maintained in delicate balance between President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> of the Army, and Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is Indonesia’s
                            paramount political figure. He occupies this position not only because
                            of his personal magnetism and hold on the masses, but because he
                            represents to the Indonesian people the symbol of their revolution and
                            the mystic incarnation of their state. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> exercises a strong general influence on
                            government policies but, unlike other prominent national leaders in
                            Asia, does not direct the course of government operations. He has
                            proclaimed Indonesia’s need for a “guided democracy,” as yet not clearly
                            defined, but has no desire to assume responsibility for the difficult
                            decisions which accompany the open exercise of power. At the same time
                            no cabinet or public official can remain in office and function
                            effectively in the face of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s active dislike or disapproval. Unlike other
                            national leaders in Asia, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> is neither the titular nor actual head of a
                            political party machine. The ruling elite appear increasingly aware that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, whatever his
                            great service to Indonesian independence, cannot provide the
                            constructive leadership required. He appears concerned by the growing
                            power of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> but is reluctant to use
                            force or to abandon his position of being above party struggles. He will
                            probably seek to manipulate non-Communist elements to counter-balance
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> strength. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> the symbol is still
                            indispensable; he is a living national monument, a political fact of
                            life which must be lived with.</p>
                        <p>9. The Indonesian Army is the largest element of the Indonesian armed
                            forces. The Army and the predominantly non-Communist orientation of its
                            officer corps, represent the principal obstacles to the continued growth
                            of Communist strength in Indonesia. This situation derives to a
                            considerable degree from the favorable impressions made on Indonesian
                            officers trained in U.S. service schools, who now hold responsible
                            positions. These officers have accepted U.S. organization, equipment,
                            and training methods and, upon return to their homeland, have exerted a
                            strong influence in orienting the Army toward the West and toward the
                            United States in particular.</p>
                        <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>10. Under the leadership of the anti-Communist General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, the Army has assumed an
                            increasingly powerful position in the political arena including a
                            growing policy-making role. The Army is likely to continue to exercise
                            considerable authority in civil affairs barring an open break between
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>. The Army’s increased power
                            has resulted from two factors: the considerable authority it is
                            permitted under the present “state of war,” and the prestige accruing
                            from its success in suppressing the regional revolt. The Army’s
                            objective is to steer a middle-of-the-road course. Navy and Air Force
                            leaders have had little apparent influence on the policies of the
                            Government of Indonesia. However, their national positions are expected
                            to improve as a result of large amounts of matériel received from the
                            Soviet Bloc, and they may take an increasing interest in the political
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>11. The Army, which is equipped with individual and light automatic
                            weapons of varied origins and types, including Dutch, British, U.S. and
                            Japanese, has reached the point where it must make major procurements of
                            weapons and equipment. Late in 1957, because the U.S. and other Western
                            countries were unwilling to sell arms to Indonesia, approaches were made
                            to the Soviet Bloc, and an Indonesian military mission is believed to
                            have purchased about $25,000,000 worth of Army hardware in Poland,
                            Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia in 1958. In the next two years the
                            Indonesian Navy is scheduled to obtain a significant number of ships
                            from the Soviet Bloc, probably on credit. In early 1958 the Indonesian
                            Air Force contracted to purchase from the Soviets about 115 aircraft,
                            including <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MIG</gloss> fighters, jet bombers,
                            transports and trainers. Additional purchases from the Soviet Bloc can
                            be expected.</p>
                        <p>12. In view of the key importance of the military as a stabilizing force
                            in Indonesia, and in view of extensive Bloc military aid, the question
                            of the quantity and form of U.S. military aid is a major policy issue.
                            Although initially reluctant to accept U.S. terms for military aid,
                            Indonesia is now actively seeking such aid. Because Indonesia previously
                            rendered inoperative a bilateral agreement, it is now legally possible
                            to provide grant assistance only under a Presidential Determination that
                            waives the necessity for the U.S. to obtain certain assurances otherwise
                            required by the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, and usually
                            included in military assistance agreements. In the summer of 1958 such a
                            Presidential Determination was made and a token military aid program of
                            about $7 million was approved. A request is now being processed to seek
                            a further Presidential Determination for an augmentation program in the
                            amount of $14.9 million which would bring the total <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 program to about $22 million.</p>
                        <p>13. U.S. policy has for a number of years called for the provision of
                            both technical assistance and economic aid to Indonesia, although for
                            the past 18 months our policy has provided that these programs should
                                <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0365"/>be oriented toward the
                            outer islands. The U.S. technical assistance program in Indonesia has
                            concentrated on the important problem of developing technical,
                            professional, and managerial skills, with major emphasis on education.
                            However, prior to about 1955, the Indonesians were reluctant to conclude
                            bilateral agreements which would have facilitated U.S. extension of
                            economic aid. Since 1955 the Indonesian Government has become more
                            receptive to U.S. economic assistance and, because of the serious
                            economic situation, is now actively seeking such assistance.</p>
                        <p>14. The Indonesian Government fiscal and financial situation is now at
                            about the lowest state since independence. During the past year,
                            additional heavy burdens were imposed on the already unstable economy by
                            a series of developments: the armed uprisings, the expansion of barter
                            trade diverting resources from the central government, the anti-Dutch
                            campaign, and the international business recession. The Indonesian
                            masses living on a subsistence economy remain relatively unaffected by
                            this situation, but the absence of economic development and the
                            inability of the Indonesian Government to provide needed public services
                            such as schools, hospitals, roads, and inter-island communications have
                            contributed to regional dissatisfaction and political unrest, and have
                            been exploited by the Communist Party, particularly on the over-crowded
                            Island of Java, to win popular support. Direct government action to
                            suppress the Communist Party would not bring lasting results unless
                            non-Communist forces in Indonesia at the same time demonstrate to the
                            masses some progress in solving Indonesia’s social and economic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>15. The shortage of trained professional men, administrators, and
                            technicians is an underlying obstacle to progress in the solution of
                            Indonesia’s manifold political, economic, and social problems. The
                            Indonesian Government is making strenuous efforts to remedy this
                            deficiency, and this is one field in which U.S. assistance can pay great
                            long-range dividends.</p>
                        <p>16. In the recent rebellion, the regionalist leaders and their rebel
                            forces in the outer islands were no match for the government forces in
                            regular military operations. However, the rebels are proving to be
                            effective guerrilla fighters and are seriously harassing the government
                            forces and hampering the reestablishment of civil authority in North and
                            Central Sumatra and North Celebes. Although the rebels lack the military
                            capability and the political following to reestablish their control of
                            major populated areas, they have some local support and can continue
                            guerrilla warfare for a prolonged period, creating serious economic and
                            political problems for the central government. Since Sumatra and Borneo
                            produce a major portion of Indonesian export earnings, they are of great
                            significance to the Indonesian economy. The central government is
                            attempting <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0366"/>to satisfy the
                            desires of the outer islands for a larger measure of fiscal and
                            administrative autonomy, and is giving priority to economic development
                            projects off the Islands of Java. Regional distrust of the central
                            government, however, is likely to continue.</p>
                        <p>17. The unresolved dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands over
                            West New Guinea has become in Indonesia a major vulnerability not only
                            to the United States and its European allies, but also to moderate
                            elements in Indonesia favoring a rapprochement with the Netherlands and
                            closer ties with the West. It has poisoned Dutch-Indonesian relations,
                            and undermined Indonesia’s otherwise excellent relations with Australia.
                            The dispute does not appear at present susceptible of early solution.
                            Both sides have taken irreconcilable positions on the basic question of
                            sovereignty, emotions are high both in Indonesia and the Netherlands,
                            and the Australians are, if anything, more determined than the Dutch
                            that West New Guinea should not come under Indonesian control.</p>
                        <p>18. The U.S. cannot expect to reap the full benefits of aid to Indonesia
                            while at the same time appearing to oppose Indonesian aspirations on the
                            one international issue which has aroused great nationalist emotion in
                            Indonesia and is a personal idée fixe with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Not to support Indonesia
                            on this issue is to leave this key gambit to the USSR. On the other
                            hand, a shift in U.S. policy would create grave complications with the
                            Netherlands and Australia, with unforeseeable results. Moreover,
                            acquisition of West New Guinea might whet Indonesia’s appetite for other
                            areas such as Timor, Papua, and British Borneo, whatever assurances
                            Indonesia might give to the contrary. Even U.S. support of Indonesia on
                            the West New Guinea issue probably would not deflect Indonesia from
                            pursuing a basically neutralist course.</p>
                        <p>19. On balance there are compelling arguments for continuing, under
                            present circumstances, a U.S. policy of neutrality in the West New
                            Guinea dispute. This policy has been followed because of the seriously
                            adverse consequences which would ensue if the United States supported
                            either the Dutch or the Indonesian position. The former would
                            drastically reduce if not eliminate United States influence in
                            Indonesia, deal a serious blow to pro-United States elements and be
                            exploited by the Soviet Bloc and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            as proof of United States hostility to the aspirations of the peoples of
                            Asia and Africa. To support Indonesia on the other hand would have an
                            equally serious damaging effect both on our bilateral relations with the
                            Netherlands and Australia and in our working relationships with the
                            former in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the latter in <gloss
                                target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss>. The intensity of public feeling
                            and the firmness of government positions in the three countries directly
                            involved further counsel against any United States effort at this time
                            to urge on the principals a compromise solution such as some form of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship, though the latter
                            might <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0367"/>provide a basis for
                            eventual compromise. Such a proposal would probably be acceptable to the
                            Netherlands only if the Netherlands and/or Australia were named the
                            administering power or powers. It would produce in Indonesia scarcely
                            less condemnation than outright espousal of the Dutch cause.</p>

                                Lloyd</persName> raised two problems with respect to Indonesia: (A)
                            danger Indonesian attack on West New Guinea creating situation in which
                            West would have to line up with Dutch thereby pushing Indonesians toward

                            >Menzies</persName>), and (B) pressure on Her Majesty’s Government
                            because of unemployment to fill Indonesian orders for arms (which he
                            said might include 10 million pounds worth of small naval ships), and
                            necessity finding some formula which would permit supply of arms but at
                            same time involving moral obligation to see they would not be used
                            against West New Guinea. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName>

                            contained reference telegram. I had prepared in advance summary list of

                                >Luns</persName> he would have had information on this current
                            program day earlier if I had not been in London, but <persName

                            difference as advance notice period of four days to Dutch was hardly

                        <p>3. I again pointed out that augmentation program was pursuant to August

                            Indonesia should endeavor to attack West New Guinea. I also pointed out
                            to <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> that of course we would
                            keep Dutch informed concerning any items of military significance which

                        <p>4. I also emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> fact

                            appreciation and understanding and his efforts to handle this program on

                            <item>Indonesia has the capability to capture one or more of the lesser
                                Dutch settlements in West New Guinea and would have a good chance of
                                launching a small-scale (up to 1,000 men) invasion force without
                                prior detection. Although Indonesia might be able to muster
                                7,000–8,000 men for an assault on the major Dutch stronghold at
                                Biak, its waterlift capability probably does not exceed 3,500 troops
                                and its airlift capability about 600 paratroopers. Moreover, it
                                could provide little effective fighter cover for such an operation.
                                Indonesian ability to coordinate operations of a scale necessary to
                                seize and hold Biak is very doubtful and preparations for such an
                                operation could probably be detected. (Paras. 7–9)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>We believe that Indonesia will probably not undertake large-scale
                                armed action within the next six months, primarily because of
                                internal security problems and concern that such an attack would
                                provoke adverse international reaction. Also, Indonesian leaders may
                                believe that present pressures may force the Dutch to yield. (Paras.
                                10–14)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Indonesian objective in a small-scale action to seize one or
                                more of the smaller settlements in West New Guinea would probably be
                                to provoke Dutch countermeasures which would attract international
                                attention and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration.
                                However, unless the Indonesians could point to strong evidence of
                                military provocation by the Dutch, they would face accusations that
                                they had resorted to armed force and the possibility of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action favorable to Indonesia would
                                be reduced. Although the arguments against large-scale military
                                action do not apply with the same force against small-scale
                                operations, we have no convincing evidence that Indonesia intends to
                                undertake small-scale action and, on balance, the odds seem to be
                                against it for the near future. (Paras. 15–16)</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Indonesian military capabilities and the temptation to resort to
                                armed force against West New Guinea will increase over the next two
                                years. However, we believe that Indonesian armed action on any
                                significant scale is and will remain much less likely than
                                Indonesian use or provocation of some incident with the Dutch so as
                                to bring the issue before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>

                        <p>From February 10 to 15 Indonesian Foreign Minister <persName

                            with Australian officials the status of West New Guinea. The Embassy in
                            Canberra summarized the results of <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName>’s Australian trip in despatch 338 from
                            Canberra, March 15. It reads in part as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, Indonesian Foreign
                            Minister, made an official visit to Australia February 10 to 15 for the
                            purpose of holding high-level discussions with the Commonwealth
                            Government toward the principal end of re-assuring Australia that
                            Indonesia does not pose a threat to this country’s security.</p>
                        <p>“To accomplish this objective, it was necessary for Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to place Indonesia’s claims
                            to West New Guinea in a new, and if possible, more favorable context.
                            The visit, therefore, was concerned essentially with the problem of West
                            New Guinea, however much both parties may have endeavored to give the
                            impression that this was not the paramount issue in the discussions.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>’s frank and
                            friendly exchanges with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1"
                                >Menzies</persName>, External Affairs Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> and other Australian officials
                            provided an opportunity for each side to explain its position and
                            policies. The result was the discovery of a broad area of understanding.
                            No definite agreement was reached on the difficult problem of West New
                            Guinea, but in a Joint Communiqué issued on February 14, Indonesia
                            categorically ruled out the use of force as a means to settle this
                            problem and Australia adopted a more flexible policy by agreeing not to
                            impose objections if Indonesia were able to acquire this territory
                            through peaceful negotiations with the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and the Australian
                            leaders were able to place the West New Guinea problem in the broader
                            context of Australian-Indonesian relations, in consequence of which the
                            air has been cleared of considerable suspicion and distrust, a basis
                            laid for more friendly relations, and the way pointed to a peaceful
                            solution of the West New Guinea problem.</p>
                        <p>“The understanding incorporated in the Joint Communiqué brings
                            Australia’s relations with Indonesia more into line with United States
                            objectives and should serve to reduce Australian concern over United
                            States economic and military assistance to Indonesia. The understanding
                            should also serve to make Indonesia more aware that it does not of
                            necessity have to seek its friends only among the Communist Bloc.”

                                1958; Department of State Bulletin, December 15, 1958, p. 954) The
                                Anderson subcommittee of the Draper Committee was headed by Dillon
                                Anderson and General J. Lawton Collins.</note> President was in

                            asked Anderson to convey personal message to President <persName

                        <p>He sent first his warm personal regards and all good wishes; as always,
                            he spoke of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            with genuine affection and admiration. He then asked Anderson to inform
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was most grateful
                            for recent news of military assistance, particularly small arms and
                            equipment for 20 battalions and that although this represented only a
                            third of Indonesian requirements he was most appreciative.</p>
                        <p>He also asked Anderson to emphasize that much as economic and military
                            aid from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> meant to Indonesia, political
                            support meant even more. In this comment he was obviously alluding to
                            West New Guinea issue, although no specific mention of it was made in
                            this context. Earlier in conversation, however, <persName

                            leaders who were his idols, mentioned Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln

                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> smilingly noted
                            that Houston had won independence of Texas from Mexico “by bullets.”
                            West New Guinea independence from Dutch would be won by peaceful means,

                            Anderson nor I made any comment at this point, none being called for in

                            Limited U.S. military aid to Indonesia has been based on premise that it
                            does not generate Indonesian military threat to Dutch position in New
                            Guinea. It has been made clear to Indonesia that any military aid from
                            us has the condition attached to it that it will be used for internal
                            security purposes and not as means to settle militarily Indonesia-Dutch
                            disputes over New Guinea. That Indonesia understands and accepts this
                            position has been affirmed most recently by Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> in Australia. For United

                            and compensatory military aid be furnished Dutch to defend New Guinea
                            would not only imply gross irresponsibility on our part by furnishing
                            both antagonists with weapons to settle dispute militarily but would
                            leave us open to Commie charge of providing military means to sow
                            dissent.</p>
                        <p>If our military aid policy vis-à-vis Indonesia is designed to retrieve
                            our position in Indonesia the whole purpose might be very largely
                            neutralized by furnishing weapons to the Dutch for a non-existent

                        <p>The 1945 Constitution, which entered into effect immediately after
                            Indonesia’s declaration of independence and continued until 1949,
                            provides for a strong, executive form of government, with considerable
                            resemblance to the American system, as opposed to the parliamentary
                            system under the present constitution. Under the 1945 document, power to
                            amend the constitution and to determine the broad lines of national
                            policy is vested in the People’s Consultative council. This council, in
                            turn, is composed of members of the People’s Representative
                            Council—i.e., the Parliament, and representatives of regional and other
                            groups. The Parliament exercises joint legislative power with the
                            President. A Supreme Consultative Council to advise the President is
                            also provided for. The manner in which members of these three Councils
                            are to be chosen is to be provided by law. The 1945 Constitution also
                            provides for an independent judiciary and appropriate ministries.</p>
                        <p>The effect of this decision by the Indonesian Government, if carried out
                            along the lines stated, would appear to be to reduce the powers
                            currently exercised by the political parties and the Parliament, while
                            strengthening the hand of the President and his advisors (including the
                            Army). All four major political parties have indicated general approval
                            of the Cabinet decision, although the Communists (<gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) have approved the return to the 1945
                            Constitution on the condition that “it exclusively serve to realize
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            conception (1957 version) of embodying Communists in the Government.” In
                            this connection, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> unequivocally February 25 that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had definitely abandoned
                            that part of his earlier concept which would call for inclusion of
                            Communists in the Cabinet.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2"><persName

                            <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0380"/>In the next few months, the
                            parties, especially the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, may be
                            expected to put up a last-ditch fight to retain some of their
                            prerogatives, particularly in connection with the coming legislation on
                            the simplification of the party system and the amendment of the general
                            election law.</p>
                        <p>It is premature to say whether the implementation of the Cabinet’s
                            decision will mean a substantial reduction of the power of the Communist
                            Party, although the tendency would appear to be in this direction.
                            Within the framework of the 1945 Constitution, the power of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> could be eclipsed along with that of
                            the other major parties so that any change in the relative <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> parliamentary strength, following the
                            next general elections, might not have as much significance as under the
                            present governmental structure. With the exception of 35 functional
                            representatives of the Armed Services to be appointed to Parliament by
                            the President, the method of selecting the functional representatives of
                            the new Parliament has not yet been made entirely clear. If the Army,
                            directly or through a controlled “National Front” apparatus, can play a
                            major role in the selection of parliamentary functional candidates, the
                            relative parliamentary strength of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> could suffer a loss at the expense of Army-approved
                            candidates. The Army, in its advisory role to the President, would also
                            be likely to frustrate any <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> attempts
                            to place Party members in key positions in the Executive.</p>

                            aircraft, spare parts, tools, test equipment, etc., at a total cost of

                            Indonesia would deposit about $1.9 million (of which at least $1.2

                            On April 25, 1957 Lockheed applied for exporter type credit financing by
                            the Export-Import Bank of the balance of approximately $8.2 million. On

                            to consideration by the Bank of $15 million financing for the Electras,
                            as well as for three Convair 440s. (Financing of the latter was
                            subsequently approved by the Bank.) During the regional rebellion in the
                            latter part of 1957 and the early months of 1958, the Department adopted
                            the policy that no additional assistance for the Indonesian Government
                            would be considered. The Bank followed this policy as regards pending
                            Indonesian loan applications, and in response to queries received from
                            the Indonesian Government, the Bank indicated that consideration of the
                            Electra loan was being held up for “technical reasons”—i.e. the lack of
                            an agreement to provide technical services to <gloss target="#t_Garuda1"
                                >Garuda</gloss>. On August 1, 1958 the Secretary approved a broad
                            range of future U.S. actions vis-à-vis Indonesia, including the
                            withdrawing of our objections on political grounds to an Ex-Im Bank loan
                            for the Electras. The Bank was notified of this decision. Another series
                            of U.S. actions regarding Indonesia, approved by the Secretary on
                            November 5, 1958, included informing the Ex-Im Bank that for political
                            reasons we wished the Bank to proceed with consideration of projects in
                            Indonesia meeting their criteria, noting the Electra loan application as
                            one of several under consideration. Again the Bank was informed of this
                            decision. Meanwhile, on October 21, 1958, <gloss target="#t_Garuda1"
                                >Garuda</gloss> signed a technical assistance contract with Lockheed
                            thus removing one of the Bank’s major objections to the granting of the
                            loan. On December 30, 1958, however, the Bank informed the Indonesian
                            Government that the Electra loan application had been turned down.</p>
                        <p>The Bank’s decision was made primarily on economic grounds. Mr. Waugh

                            of view of banking and economics, it was not a good loan, that the Bank
                            had unpaid commitments of over $86 million in Indonesia and pending
                            applications for new loans totaling over $70 million. It should be
                            noted, however, that Indonesia has an unblemished record in servicing
                            these outstanding commitments to the Bank. Some confusion also arose
                            over the priority which the Indonesians attached to the Electra loan in
                            relation to possible loans for other pending projects and this may have
                            contributed <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0383"/>to the Bank’s
                            negative decision. In August and again in November 1958 the Indonesian
                            Ambassador in Washington indicated to the Bank that two or more of the
                            other pending projects were of higher priority than the Electras which
                            was apparently contrary to the position of the Indonesian Government
                            that the Electra loan be pressed as foremost in importance. This matter
                            was clarified around the end of the year with the Electras definitely
                            accorded No. 1 priority by the Indonesians. However, the Bank apparently
                            still felt that the financing of some of the other pending projects—e.g.
                            dredges, fertilizer plant, etc.—would in the long run be more beneficial
                            to the Indonesian economy. A second major reason for the Bank’s turndown
                            was a recommendation received by the Air Coordinating Committee that the
                            Bank finance the sale of used piston planes which are about to be
                            replaced by jets. The Bank has indicated its willingness to Indonesia to
                            consider the financing of reconditioned DC–6s and 7s up to $3
                            million.</p>
                        <p>The Indonesian Government has expressed great disappointment at the
                            Bank’s decision and has asked that it be urgently reconsidered. While
                            the contract with Lockheed has expired, negotiations are currently
                            proceeding between the Indonesian Government and Lockheed in Djakarta
                            whereby a new contract will be signed or the old one extended to keep
                            this transaction open for another 30–90 days. The Indonesian Parliament
                            has not yet been informed of the Bank’s turndown which is not yet public
                            knowledge. President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            himself, has taken a strong personal interest in the loan for the
                            Electras. Regarding DC–6s and 7s, he has told our Ambassador that
                            Indonesia does not want second-hand aircraft. The Bank’s turndown, if
                            definitive, will be bound to have an undesirable effect on
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations, but particularly on our relations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. This comes at a
                            critical juncture when there is increasing evidence of the President’s
                            casting off of Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>)
                            support and an expected reformulation of the Government’s structure
                            which could lead to a further eclipse of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>. A denial of this loan would likely hand the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> a strong propaganda weapon by which the
                            U.S. would be attacked for lack of good faith in prolonging negotiations
                            for almost two years, in tying up a substantial amount of scarce foreign
                            exchange thus preventing Indonesia from acquiring such aircraft
                            elsewhere and then turning its back at the last moment. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has already made the Electra loan an
                            issue in Parliament several months ago and the Party would not lose
                            another opportunity to embarrass the Government and press for purchase
                            of these aircraft from the bloc. The prestige of the Government is at
                            stake since it has repeatedly encouraged Parliament to believe the
                            Electra loan would ultimately be received.</p>
                        <p>I know you are very much aware of the massive assistance drive which the

                            resources at our disposal if we are to retain our influence in these key
                            areas, selecting our projects carefully so as to achieve the maximum
                            possible impact. The Electra loan is, I believe, such a project.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted here that the Indonesian Government as well as our
                            Ambassador in Djakarta do not share the Bank’s views as to the economic
                            soundness of this loan. While the Indonesian arguments in this regard
                            are not completely convincing, I support the Ambassador’s recommendation
                            that if there is doubt as to the loan’s economic soundness, this doubt
                            be resolved in Indonesia’s favor on political grounds. Failure to do so
                            could mean a reversal in the hard-won gains we have made in Indonesia
                            since last May.</p>

                            expressed great gratitude for military and economic assistance but
                            repeated statement frequently made in the past that moral and political
                            support even more important to Indonesia than material support. He again
                            said, “Don’t let Communists win this game,” pointing out that
                            international Communists supported Indonesia strongly on this most
                            sensitive question. He referred to speeches of Ho Chi Minh during visit

                        <p>Senator Smith responded that he was here on goodwill mission and would
                            take back President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            message but that he was not authorized or prepared to enter into

                        <p>When Senator Smith referred to Syngman Rhee in commenting on his
                            itinerary, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said, “Why

                            nations had no reason to quarrel with each other. Senator Smith said he
                            would be glad to pass this message on to President Rhee when he saw
                            him.</p>

                            replied with an emphatic affirmative. I observed that this came very
                            close to the American strong President form of government. <persName

                        <p>On March 19 British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Lloyd</persName> arrived in the United
                            States for a series of consultations with U.S. officials on matters of
                            mutual concern. During one of these meetings, held at Camp David on
                            March 22, Indonesia was discussed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen

                                    Indonesia. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has moved somewhat
                                    away from dependence upon the Soviets. He is moving back toward
                                    the old constitution. Their economic situation is bad, and they
                                    have been unable to put down the rebels in Sumatra and the
                                    Celebes. He commented that the rebels include many of the finest
                                    men in the leadership ranks in Indonesia. Exports of rubber and
                                    tin remain disturbed by the continuing rebellion. He thought
                                    there was advantage in trying to bring both sides together, and
                                    suggested that the British might be in better position than we
                                    are to attempt to do so. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
                                        >Lloyd</persName> said he understood the United States is
                                    providing some arms to the Indonesians. The <gloss

                                    creates a most difficult situation with the Dutch who recognize
                                    but are not persuaded by our argument that if we do not provide
                                    these arms the Indonesians will turn to the Soviets. Sir
                                    Frederick Hover Millar commented on one new factor in the
                                    situation—the Australians said, about two months ago, that they
                                    would accept any solution relating to New Guinea that was agreed
                                    upon by the Dutch and the Indonesians.” (Memorandum of

                        <p>The Indonesian Air Force has ordered ten C–130B’s from Lockheed Aircraft
                            Corporation, which has applied to the Department for the necessary
                            export license. The Indonesians have asked us for a decision on the
                            export license by April 2, 1959, in part to insure that delivery of the
                            planes can begin October 1960 as presently scheduled.</p>
                        <p>I believe the license should be issued for the following principal
                            reasons: <list>

                                    licensing them for export would appear to be in the spirit of
                                    the Secretary’s decision. The C–130B is a propeller-driven
                                    (prop-jet), unarmed airplane designed for the transport of
                                    military cargo and personnel.</item>

                                    been requested. The total estimated cost of the ten airplanes is
                                    $31 million.</item>

                                    C–130B’s cannot begin until October 1960. Delivery of the ten
                                    planes is not scheduled to be completed until October

                                <item>The C–130B would seem to be particularly well-suited to the
                                    needs of a dispersed country such as Indonesia in maintaining
                                    internal security. It is designed to provide a high degree of
                                    mobility for troops and equipment, and is said to possess
                                    unusual ability to land on and take off from rough fields. This
                                    plane seems a sensible choice by the Indonesians for their
                                    requirements, and is a plane in which they have expressed
                                    particular interest.</item>

                            concerned that the momentum of improved relations with Indonesia
                            resulting from the token aid program and, more recently, the
                            augmentation to that program, be maintained. Needed action was taken to
                            expedite the interim program and it is our opinion that additional
                            action is now needed to achieve realization of United States objectives
                            in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>As Defense is convinced that insofar as practicable further piecemeal
                            actions should be avoided, this office, in conjunction with other
                            elements of Defense, has been discussing initiation of an integrated
                            long-range military assistance program of limited size. During a recent
                            discussion of this matter with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1"
                                >Felt</persName>, it was proposed that Mr. <persName

                            talk to the Indonesians about the type of limited <gloss

                            have developed on a long-term basis. It would, of course, be emphasized
                            that the United States participants at this meeting could not commit the

                        <p>The Department of Defense recommends that guidelines governing the

                            expressing his regret over the news which he had just heard regarding
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s resignation.<note

                                8.</note> He then said that in the talk which he had just concluded
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName><note n="2"
                                xml:id="d191fn2">As reported in a memorandum of conversation, April
                                1. (Department of State, Central Files, 656C.56D/4–159) See
                                Supplement.</note> he had indicated that the political deterrent
                            against an attack by Indonesia on West New Guinea had worked so far. The
                            Indonesian intention to mount such an attack had been shelved for the
                            time being. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said he
                            thought that it would be most useful for the United States and the
                            United Kingdom to keep up the policy of public and private deterrents
                            against the use of force by Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> recalled that the
                            Secretary had spoken most forcefully to Indonesian Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> last November on
                            the question of force. In Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s opinion Indonesia realized that the state of
                            the world was such that attempts to settle issues between nations
                            through the use of force would not be tolerated. The Secretary had told
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> that if Indonesia
                            used force against West New Guinea, the United States would be against
                            Indonesia. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had
                            replied that he knew this and he also knew that if Indonesia should
                            attempt to use force, the opinion of the entire world would be against
                            it. The dispute between Indonesia and the Dutch was not the only dispute
                            in this world, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                            >Robertson</persName>, and the world would not tolerate the use of force
                            to settle these disputes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that while this
                            might be true, there was irresponsible elements in Indonesia which might
                            not be sensitive to world opinion. <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365"
                                facs="0391"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            replied that in our opinion the responsible elements which were the
                            important ones in Indonesia fully realized that the use of force would
                            not be tolerated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that the Netherlands
                            had no doubt that Indonesia had a plan to use force against West New
                            Guinea and that the plans called for an attack some time in March. The
                            fact that the Indonesians had called it off had caused much
                            disappointment among Indonesian agents in West New Guinea. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then said that his Government was
                            most worried about the intention of Swedish shipyards to build two
                            destroyers of the “Halland” class for Indonesia. These destroyers would
                            be as powerful as any ships the Dutch have in the West New Guinea area.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            Indonesia’s actions in building up its defensive capacities was because
                            Indonesia held that its most dangerous enemy today was Red China. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> pointed out that the
                            Indonesians had taken action against the Chinese Nationalists in
                            Indonesia and not the Red Chinese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied that our reports were that Indonesia
                            had taken action against the Chinese population as a whole because the
                            Indonesians were concerned about the activities of the Chinese
                            population in Indonesia. In our opinion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said, Indonesia was more acutely aware of the
                            menace of international Communism than ever before. It was increasingly
                            concerned about becoming overly entangled with the Communists and in
                            this connection Indonesia recently turned down a Soviet loan. With
                            regard to the question of arms, if the Indonesians could not get arms
                            from the United States, they would get them from the Soviets. The Soviet
                            bloc was ready and willing to provide such arms as Indonesia desired.
                            However, the Indonesians did not wish to depend solely on the Soviets
                            for their supply.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he agreed that
                            if the Indonesians had to depend on a foreign source of supply, it would
                            be better for United States to be this source. However, he could not
                            agree that Indonesia’s request for arms from Sweden was desirable since
                            the Swedes were only interested in the commercial aspect and had no
                            means whereby they could exercise any responsibility with respect to the
                            use of these arms. The Swedish destroyers were a very heavy type with
                            strong armament. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            requested that we look into this question in Stockholm. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> added that he would almost prefer
                            the Indonesians to obtain Soviet destroyers because at least there was a
                            chance that at some future time the Indonesians might not be able to get
                            the necessary spare parts.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> summed up by saying that
                            there were two points involved in Indonesia’s attitude toward West New
                            Guinea. The first was the political deterrent and this had worked so
                            far. The second point was that if the political deterrent failed, there
                            would be a vaccum because no plans had been devised in anticipation of
                            that situation. If the political deterrent failed, it would mean the
                            failure of the entire Western policy, since <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366"
                                facs="0392"/>Indonesia would be supported by the Soviet bloc in its
                            actions against West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            disagreement between the Dutch and ourselves was on how to ensure a
                            non-Communist Indonesia, not on the objective which we and the Dutch
                            shared. The United States believed that there has been steady progress
                            in achieving the objective. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said that in a sense the rabid anti-Dutch feeling
                            in Indonesia has helped United States policy because the Indonesians
                            derived a certain amount of satisfaction from their belief that we were
                            working with Indonesia against the Dutch. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that we took no sides
                            in this matter and that our only aim was to keep Indonesia out of the
                            Communist sphere.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> pointed out that since
                            1945 almost 288,000 Dutchmen had returned to Holland from Indonesia. Of
                            this number about one-half were Eurasian. The last 50,000, who came last
                            year from Indonesia, arrived in a nearly destitute condition. The influx
                            had placed a heavy burden on the Netherlands whose population had
                            increased during the last six years from about 10,500,000 to about
                            11,600,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired what in Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>’ view would be the best
                            solution to the West New Guinea question. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied that he thought the
                            Papuans on the whole, both in Australia and Netherlands areas, should
                            form a single unit. In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said this would be achieved through
                            self-determination and through the guidance of those now governing and
                            administering the areas. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>

                                >Jack</persName></hi>: Thank you for your letter of March 28, 1959,
                            commenting on the future of the United States military assistance
                            program in Indonesia.<note n="1" xml:id="d192fn1"><ref target="#d190"
                                    >Document 190</ref>.</note> The Department of course shares the
                            gratification expressed by the Department of Defense at recent
                            improvements in United States-Indonesian relations, stemming in
                            substantial part from the military assistance program.</p>
                        <p>We also agree that hard and continuing thought should be given to the
                            future of the program. However, we believe it preferable that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRH1">Knight</persName> and Admiral O’Donnell
                            neither raise the question of a long-range program with the Indonesians
                            nor respond specifically to Indonesian overtures along these lines which
                            may be made. Should the Indonesians bring up the matter with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRH1">Knight</persName> and Admiral O’Donnell,
                            as well they may, some discussion cannot be avoided. In our view, while
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRH1">Knight</persName> and Admiral O’Donnell
                            might indicate United States recognition of Indonesian needs, they
                            should carefully avoid any impression of any commitment to provide
                            additional aid or of encouraging expectations of a continuing
                            program.</p>
                        <p>We hold this view because the present United States policy towards
                            Indonesia remains one of proceeding step-by-step as we assess the
                            strength and determination of non-and anti-Communist elements in
                            Indonesia to move that country in the direction we would like to see her
                            take, for her sake as well as our own. This policy derives from the
                            impossibility of foreseeing now the likely course of (1) internal
                            Indonesian politics and (2) Indonesian foreign policies. Under the
                            circumstances it seems premature to discuss a long-range military
                            assistance program with the Indonesians. To do so might well give them
                            an exaggerated idea of the extent to which the United States is
                            presently willing and able to go to meet their desires for military
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not favor discussion of a long-range program with the
                            Indonesians at this time, we do believe it would be most helpful for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRH1">Knight</persName> and Admiral O’Donnell
                            to discuss the matter fully with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>
                            officers in Djakarta. We believe it is essential constantly to review
                            and evaluate developments in Indonesia to <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368"
                                facs="0394"/>guide us in the development of our policy towards
                            Indonesia. For example, we shall wish to observe carefully how the
                            projected Indonesian governmental reorganization measures are applied.
                            If these measures are carried out in such a way that a more stable
                            government and a more decisive curbing of Communist influence seem
                            likely to result, it might then be timely to consider the possibility of
                            considering further military assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>It may be desirable meanwhile to examine the feasibility of engaging in a
                            long-range military assistance program should such a program be
                            determined to be in our best interest. Consideration of a long-range
                            program would have to take into account, for instance, in addition to
                            the guidelines you suggest, the difficulty of planning on a long-range
                            basis when Mutual Security funds are appropriated year-by-year in
                            unpredictable amounts. Any long-range program for Indonesia would have
                            also to be coordinated with the many other demands on <gloss
                                target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss> funds, a potentially serious problem
                            since these demands invariably exceed the funds available.</p>

                            Aircraft could be used to drop parachutists and thus in an aggressive

                            would be “very disappointed and disturbed” by this action. It would
                            cause chain reaction other allied and friendly countries which would no
                            longer see need to use restraint in furnishing arms to Indonesians.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said we were not
                            surprised by Dutch reaction and it was in view of their probable
                            reaction that we desired inform them soonest of our decision. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> made point that in Indonesian
                            archipelago almost any sort of military equipment, even in internal
                            security categories, could be used for aggressive purposes. He also
                            pointed out that Indonesian Air Force has set aside necessary money
                            (about $31 million) needed for this cash transaction and that if <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> withheld approval of export licenses,
                            Indonesian Air Force would buy comparable type from Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reviewed background of
                            our military assistance to Indonesia and said <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> had been gratified by progress achieved through our
                            phased assistance of limited nature. Decision to grant export licenses
                            was in line with decisions taken last November and about which Dutch had
                            been fully informed. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            stressed that Indonesians did not wish to be dependent on Soviet Bloc
                            and that if we refused licenses for these planes we would impair and
                            reverse satisfactory trend of Indonesia toward Free World. He recalled
                            what Secretary had said to <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> last November about our opposition to use of
                            force against West New Guinea and that entire world would condemn it. In

                            that Netherlands did not trust Indonesian word and that unstable
                            situation in Indonesia might well get out of hand and result in attack
                            on West New Guinea <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said
                            that in final analysis <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> maintained
                            control over delivery of these aircraft which could be withheld if
                            situation deteriorated. This would not be the case if Indonesia received
                            aircraft from Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that risks
                            involved in furnishing aircraft great and that by 1960 Indonesia would
                            already be receiving these aircraft. It <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370"

                        <p>5. From <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> to arrange opportunity for
                            private talk with me which we had after dinner at Embassy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> gave long exposé of reasons for
                            return to 1945 constitution as apparently Indonesians are very sensitive
                            that we may think they are abandoning democracy in making this shift.
                            After I had reassured him on this point he asked if I had any questions.
                            I told him my primary interest was economic development and I understood
                            one of the main Indonesian problems was the expense of combatting the
                            rebellion. I asked him how long he expected this to continue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> replied the most pessimistic
                            estimates were that it would take 3 more years to complete the
                            suppression of the rebellion, but he said he hoped and expected that
                            there would be a political solution earlier. He alluded to the
                            government’s recent success in negotiating a political solution with
                            Atjehnese and indicated he hoped for something similar in other rebel
                            held territory. He then quickly said the time was not yet ripe for such
                            negotiations and that if it proved necessary to carry matters to
                            ultimate military conclusion then 3 years would be required.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> then launched into what
                            apparently was main reason he had wished to talk with me. This was his
                            conviction that the many bureaucratic details in implementing <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid projects were largely destroying
                            their psychological usefulness. He emphasized that he was not thinking
                            of any increase in dollar volume of aid but that both the negotiation of
                            projects and implementation once they were negotiated left much to be
                            desired. He pointed out this was particularly so in view of invidious
                            comparison with Soviet aid practices and stated that the majority of
                            Soviet aid programs were being promptly and rapidly implemented. He then
                            asked my view regarding Soviet aid.</p>
                        <p>I told him <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had no objection to the
                            acceptance of Soviet aid as such because a cement plant for instance
                            would serve development purposes equally well no matter who had
                            constructed it. I said we were concerned lest countries unwittingly get
                            into position where they were dependent on Soviet aid. Soviets had shown
                            in the case of Yugoslavia that they were fully prepared to terminate
                            their aid programs at moment’s notice for political reasons. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> said he was glad to hear my
                            views and assured me Indonesian Govt was well aware of danger of their
                            dependence on Soviet aid. He then repeated plea that some action be
                            taken to expedite our procedures. I told him we were well aware of <pb

                            force have been neglected. Navy does not want aircraft carriers or
                            guided missiles; want small patrol craft. Admiral Subijakto had reported
                            to him would take two or three years to train people for equipment they
                            have recently purchased.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>In view of significant political developments impending in Indonesia, the
                            present situation in that country is discussed in a paper at Tab A,
                            which may be summarized as follows: On April 22, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> formally proposed, in his
                            own name and that of the Indonesian Government, that Indonesia return to
                            its 1945 Constitution in order to (1) rekindle the revolutionary fervor
                            and unity of that year when independence was proclaimed and (2)
                            stabilize Indonesian Government and politics through “guided democracy”.
                            The 1945 Constitution (Tab B) envisages a strong executive in contrast
                            to the present parliamentary system which has proved unstable over the
                            past ten years.</p>
                        <p>The next few weeks are likely to be marked by political tension in
                            Indonesia as the President’s proposal is debated in the Constituent
                            Assembly by representatives of the political parties. Inasmuch as
                            “guided democracy” is designed in part to reduce the importance and
                            power of the parties in the Indonesian political system, the parties are
                            reluctant to accept the scheme. On the other hand, they are also
                            reluctant to oppose <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            with his great popular prestige. They must consider as well the extreme
                            but real possibility that the Army might impose a less welcome form of
                            “guided democracy” should the parties fail to accept the President’s
                            proposal voluntarily.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy reports that the Constituent Assembly probably will accept
                            the 1945 Constitution but that some of the parties may seek to amend it
                            and thus cause an impasse in the Assembly. The Army is reported to be
                            prepared to force approval of the President’s proposal if necessary, in
                            the interest of ending the chaotic political situation that has fostered
                            the growth of Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>)
                            strength during the past few years.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Departments of State and Defense are exploring possible means of
                            accelerating delivery of arms to Indonesia under our military assistance
                            program, in response to requests from highly-placed Indonesian Army
                            officers that we speed up deliveries and thereby strengthen the Army’s
                            position both psychologically and materially in the present delicate
                            situation.</p>

                        <p>After a long period of delay the Indonesian cabinet recently presented to
                            Parliament a draft petroleum law which includes features considered to
                            be inimical to the operations of the three major foreign oil companies
                            in Indonesia: <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> Pacific Oil
                            Company, Standard-Vacuum Oil Company, and Royal Dutch/Shell. Some of the
                            basic features, such as primary dependence on governmental and mixed
                            companies for the development of oil resources, stem from philosophies
                            now prevailing in Indonesia, and objection to those aspects of the
                            legislation will undoubtedly be unavailing. There has, however, been
                            some feeling among the oil companies that certain features of the bill
                            should be the subject of protest. These features are:</p>

                                extension) for private companies than for mixed companies (40 years
                                plus extension).</item>

                            <item>The requirement that 20 percent of refining, storage and
                                transportation capacity be made available for government use at

                            <item>The transitional provision for current concessions which requires
                                current holders to conform to the new law within two years with the
                                possibility of a year’s extension. This feature, incorporated in
                                Article 41, is regarded as a violation of the principle of sanctity
                                of contracts. <gloss target="#t_STANVAC1">STANVAC</gloss> in

                                London was recently informed by a representative of the Foreign
                                Office that the Foreign Office was still considering whether the

                                >STANVAC</gloss> have indicated to the Embassy that they strongly
                            oppose the idea of a joint governmental approach on the grounds that it
                            would arouse Indonesian antagonism and do more harm than good (Tab B).
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> has likewise
                            indicated his opposition to the idea of a joint approach. He has
                            recommended that he approach the Prime Minister and Acting Foreign
                            Minister by himself but not on a formal basis. He also suggested the
                            possibility that the British Ambassador might do likewise.</p>
                        <p>Both <gloss target="#t_STANVAC1">STANVAC</gloss> and Shell were requested
                            by the GOI to submit their views on the proposed legislation and both
                            did so (Tab C). <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1">CALTEX</gloss> was not asked
                            to submit its views but after some consideration of the subject decided
                            to do so without being requested. <gloss target="#t_CALTEX1"
                                >CALTEX</gloss> believes that strong protests against the
                            legislation would tend to force the present Parliament to take action
                            now, whereas in the absence of pressure, Parliamentary action might be
                            deferred until after the adoption of the 1945 Constitution.</p>
                        <p>In view of the sensitivities of the Indonesians regarding any indication
                            of foreign intervention, and in view of the possibility that the passage
                            of the petroleum bill may be considerably delayed by internal political
                            factors, we believe that any United States approach regarding the
                            petroleum legislation should be made informally by the Embassy in
                            Djakarta and not in conjunction with the approach of any other
                            Government.</p>

                                Rights</hi></p>
                        <p>The bill providing for the cancellation of inactive mining rights, which
                            was passed by Parliament on February 4, provides an escape clause by
                            which the Minister of Industries is given the discretion to make
                            exceptions to the law. Although the oil companies view this law as being
                            detrimental to their best interests, it is believed that formal official
                            representation against the law would be counterproductive because of
                            Indonesian sensitivities. We feel that the best approach would be for
                            the oil companies to seek exceptions as needed, but if official
                            representation is found to be appropriate, it should be handled
                            informally.</p>
                        <p>Tab D provides an indication of the importance of the oil companies to
                            the Indonesian economy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Walter</persName></hi>: I have been
                            giving further thought to the problem of supplying arms to Indonesia
                            which we discussed in Washington in April,<note n="1" xml:id="d200fn1"
                                >No record of this discussion was found in Department of State
                                files.</note> and believe it might be helpful to put some of my
                            ideas on paper.</p>
                        <p>We have two responsibilities here in this matter. One is to execute U.S.
                            policy as effectively and persuasively as possible. The other is to
                            reflect to the Department our own best thinking as a contribution to
                            continuing policy formation. For both these duties I found the talks
                            with you very helpful. This letter is addressed to the second
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>We and our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies recognize the
                            importance of trying to keep Indonesia out of the Communist camp, though
                            there are differing opinions as to the value of arms deliveries for this
                            purpose. I welcome evidence on this score which we can give our
                            colleagues. I do not underestimate this. Arms are often the surest road
                            to the hearts of generals.</p>
                        <p>It is also essential in our long range policy that we consider the
                            effects of this program on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>From our conversations here, we believe that what the Dutch, and others,
                            are worrying about are three things: <list>
                                <item>First, that, following the lead of the U.S., other countries
                                    will find it impossible to resist commercial pressures to sell
                                    arms to Indonesia (a fear that is now being shown to be well
                                    founded) and that the cumulative total of military equipment
                                    from all sources, both East and West, will give such a degree of
                                    strength to Indonesia as to tempt them, at some propitious
                                    moment to undertake some kind of military exploit against West
                                    New Guinea either openly or under the guise of protecting the
                                    Indonesians there.</item>
                                <item>Second, they are concerned that public pressures at home, in
                                    light of this growing Indonesian military strength, may lead to
                                    a demand for reinforcing the defense of West New Guinea at the
                                    expense of the Dutch contribution to the <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense effort in arms,
                                    money, and men.</item>
                                <item>Third, they are concerned at the psychological effect on the
                                    whole <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance, which is
                                    the cornerstone of Dutch foreign policy and defense policy, lest
                                    public reaction against sales to Indonesia by <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies should be transformed
                                    into a real breach with Western Allies.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>These three problems, we must agree, are real political problems to which
                            our policy affords no clean answer. We have not given a binding <pb
                                n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0406"/>security commitment to
                            intervene in the event of Indonesian attack on West New Guinea. It is
                            therefore difficult to count on the extent to which the Dutch will be
                            able to satisfy criticism at home by referring to the statements we have
                            made to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that we would
                            be in opposition to any such move.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not the Dutch could adequately reinforce their forces in West
                            New Guinea to hold it against an Indonesian assault, or provide adequate
                            protection to their nationals there, the emotional and political
                            pressures on the Dutch Government to make a show in this direction are
                            great. And if substantial reinforcements are sent, as the Dutch have
                            said, it is doubtful that the Netherlands Parliament would vote
                            additional funds to replace the forces that the Netherlands would
                            withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to serve that end.
                            The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense effort would, in
                            political fact, have to foot the bill because Dutch public opinion will
                            hold its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies in large part
                            responsible for having created this problem.</p>
                        <p>This is where we have serious problems. The Dutch have been one of the
                            stoutest of our Allies, providing on an outstanding scale the great part
                            of their <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military requirements. In
                            the political area, the Dutch have taken a sound, practical, tough line
                            against all of the traps the Communists attempt to set in order to
                            destroy <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. It would have a serious
                            effect on the Alliance should a change of policy result in a diminution
                            of the Dutch defense effort or a change in Dutch attitude towards <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> unity and toughness. We would indeed
                            be losing a leader in the cause we serve, and I fear that there might be
                            other waverers that would use the Dutch example to reduce their defense
                            effort or to vary their policy. I think we can reduce the dangers in
                            this situation in several ways: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We should lend an attentive ear to the Dutch request to
                                    purchase further military equipment at “surplus” prices.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We should limit further sales to Indonesia especially of arms
                                    of an offensive character.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>I think very frankly we can be more forthcoming in dealing
                                    with the Dutch than we have been in the past. Granted that they
                                    are hyper-sensitive and granted that they have their own goals
                                    in mind, I think we can be a little more considerate in dealing
                                    with them in the future. We have now made our position clear,
                                    and although it makes them squirm they know what it is. I would
                                    urge that in the future we make every effort to advise them <hi
                                        rend="italic">in advance</hi> of the issuance of license for
                                    export and <hi rend="italic">in advance</hi> of the conclusion
                                    of sales agreements. I know that the Indonesians are also
                                    sensitive, and that if they thought Dutch agreement was involved
                                    in our actions, the goal of the program would be jeopardized.
                                    But the Dutch can be trusted to keep a confidence for the maybe
                                    forty-eight hours involved in advance notification. This would
                                    simply be following the accepted procedure for <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consultation, which is

                            present <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> with opportunity to exploit by
                            means of some warm personal gesture from <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            or Gettysburg would be the best possible means of accomplishing the
                            objective of placing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Indonesian
                            relations on a close personal basis, which is the only basis which has
                            much impact on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. At
                            the same time it would play to his vanity, another essential in

                            and might present precedent problems, but I can suggest two useful
                            alternatives which would be for Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to visit California coincident
                            with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s stay, with an
                            informal meeting to be arranged as a consequence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is a staunch admirer of the
                            Vice President and any courtesy from him would have considerable
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Another possibility which I urge to be done in any event would be for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to send a
                            wire to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> at the time
                            of his arrival in Los Angeles, welcoming him to the country and
                            expressing a wish for a pleasant stay there and in Honolulu.</p>

                        <p>No doubt <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s personal
                            stock in Washington is at even a lower ebb than usual due to erratic
                            performance during his trip. Nevertheless he continues to be the center
                            of political gravity in Indonesia and we must hold his friendship if we
                            are to achieve our objectives here, even if sometimes his visit be
                            repugnant to us.</p>

                        <p>In Despatch No. 904 the Embassy submitted a recommendation that the
                            United States abandon its present policy toward the dispute between
                            Indonesia and the Netherlands over West New Guinea in favor of a policy
                            of actively seeking a solution to the dispute.</p>
                        <p>In this despatch the Embassy submits a specific proposal for settlement
                            of the West New Guinea dispute, including both a formula for settlement
                            and a suggested method to be followed in obtaining approval of the
                            formula by the two disputants. In summary, the two-part formula
                            envisages (1) a special United Nations trusteeship over the territory
                            for a limited number of years, at the end of which time sovereignty
                            would be turned over to Indonesia, and (2) a bilateral agreement between
                            Indonesia and the Netherlands providing for the payment by Indonesia of
                            adequate compensation for seized Dutch assets and the removal of
                            discriminatory restrictions against Dutch nationals. Steps to effect the
                            settlement would be inaugurated by a General Assembly resolution calling
                            on the two sides to negotiate the dispute, thereby giving the United
                            States an opening to convince both sides to accept the proposed
                            formula.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Part I—The Formula for
                            Settlement</hi></p>
                        <p>A satisfactory settlement of the West New Guinea dispute is possible only
                            if each disputant receives what it considers to be substantial
                            compensation from the other in return for concessions offered. The
                            elements for mutual compensation can be found in (1) the Indonesian
                            demand for sovereignty over West New Guinea, and (2) the Dutch demands
                            for adequate compensation for Dutch assets seized by Indonesia and for
                            the elimination of Indonesian discrimination against Dutch business,
                            cultural entities, language, etc. A two-part settlement, accordingly, is
                            required, one part covering sovereignty over West New Guinea and the
                            other compensation for Dutch assets. The mutual lack of trust felt by
                            both participants to the dispute makes it necessary that both parts of
                            the settlement come into effect simultaneously, that each part be
                            brought to completion at about the same time, and that execution of the
                            two parts be linked. This can be accomplished through (1) a special
                            United Nations trusteeship which would assume sovereignty over West New
                            Guinea for five years, at the end of which period sovereignty would be
                            transferred to Indonesia if certain conditions were met, and (2) a
                            bilateral agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, by which the
                            former agrees to the payment in installments of adequate compensation
                            for seized Dutch assets, and further agrees to the progressive removal
                            of discriminatory restrictions on Dutch enterprises in Indonesia.</p>

                            following terms of reference: To administer the trust territory of West
                            New Guinea for a period of five years and to take measures during this
                            period to effect the orderly transfer of sovereignty over the territory
                            to Indonesia, the Dutch administering power to utilize this period to
                            effect the withdrawal of its prior administrative apparatus, and the
                            Indonesian administering power to utilize this period in making
                            necessary preparations for the assumption of sovereignty. Transfer of
                            sovereignty would be postponed if, at the end of five years, (a) the
                            trustees were unanimously agreed that preparations were not complete, or
                            (b) the United Nations made a finding that such transfer would, under
                            then existing conditions, be a threat to world peace.</p>

                        <p>The identity of the third nation of the trusteeship would be subject to
                            certain limiting criteria: It should not be one of the former colonies
                            or strong anti-colonialists among the Afro-Asian states, any of whom
                            would be considered by the Dutch as unduly favorable to Indonesian
                            interests; to meet similar Indonesian sensitivities, it should not be
                            either a Western European nation or Australia; it should not be Japan
                            because of its wartime association with West New Guinea; and, in our
                            interests, it obviously must not be a Soviet bloc country.</p>
                        <p>The United States itself is an obvious candidate for the third trust
                            power. This may, however, be inadvisable. The third trust power will, in
                            effect, be the actual governing power in West New Guinea during the
                            trust period, and will be in the position—particularly during the
                            earlier years—of deciding between opposing Dutch and Indonesian views.
                            Its decisions may at times create strong reactions in the Netherlands
                            and, especially Indonesia. As the United States is already labeled as
                            the chief external enemy by Indonesian leftists, it appears unwise to
                            place us in a position whereby we will provide a standing target for
                            communist propaganda and agitation for five years, particularly as the
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would use our inevitable
                            “adverse” decisions on the commission to drum up support among other
                            nationalist groups for its anti-American campaign. A further
                            consideration is that United States participation in the trusteeship
                            would bring forth the most strenuous efforts by the Soviet bloc to
                            frustrate its establishment and defeat its objectives. Soviet opposition
                            to the trusteeship can be expected in any event, but its intensity would
                            be increased by direct American participation therein.</p>
                        <p>The most suitable third power in the trusteeship, accordingly, is one
                            relatively remote from the dispute and one belonging neither to
                            Afro-Asia, Western Europe or the Soviet bloc. Among countries meeting

                            trusteeship, Indonesia and the Netherlands would initiate bilateral
                            negotiations leading to treaty or other form of agreement covering (1)
                            the payment of compensation for Dutch enterprises seized by Indonesia,
                            (2) the elimination of discriminatory restrictions on Dutch commercial
                            and cultural activities in Indonesia, (3) the status of Dutch interests
                            in West New Guinea at the conclusion of the trusteeship period, and (4)
                            the re-establishment of normal trade and consular relations between the
                            two countries.</p>
                        <p>Points two, three and four could be handled in a relatively simple manner
                            by clauses extending to Dutch enterprises and Dutch nationals in all
                            fields the same rights now enjoyed by the enterprises and nationals of
                            other countries in Indonesia, and by an Indonesian commitment to revoke
                            progressively all conflicting laws and regulations over a stated period

                            the United States faces a particular problem in that the current
                            intransigence of both participants all but precludes a direct approach
                            to <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0414"/>either. Should the United

                                    propose the following: that the Dutch vote against the pending

                                    loyal members of the United Nations, to accede to the demand for
                                    negotiations notwithstanding their opposition to it. The formula

                                    formula be acceptable to them, we would make a major effort to
                                    induce the Dutch to accept it, to the extent of applying quiet
                                    pressure if necessary.</item>

                                    would be in the hands of both governments for later second

                        <p>As stated in Despatch No. 904, the Embassy believes the foregoing
                            proposal for settlement of the West New Guinea dispute to be feasible
                            and to avoid certain of the pitfalls which otherwise will threaten

                            strongly recommends that steps be taken as soon as possible to draft an
                            alternative proposal.</p>

                        <p>On May 29 the United States and Indonesia concluded an agreement under
                            Title I of Public Law 480 by which the United States agreed to provide

                            nonfat dry powdered milk. The agreement, which was signed in Djakarta by

                                    >Robertson</persName> resigned on June 30 and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> became Assistant Secretary
                                the following day.</note> The Minister said further that upon the
                            receipt of the news of the Secretary’s death, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had said that although in
                            many things he disagreed with the former Secretary, he would be greatly
                            missed, especially since it was always known where the Secretary stood
                            and he could be relied upon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> assured the Minister there would be no change
                            in our policy as a result of the changes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we were
                            glad that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            had come back to visit the United States and he hoped that the visit to
                            Los Angeles had gone well. The Minister expressed his appreciation for
                            the way the Los Angeles visit had been handled. He said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> now has a grasp
                            of the problems of Indonesia [<hi rend="italic">the United States</hi>?]
                            and of details which he previously did not have and that this is bound
                            to have a more definite impact on the policy of the Government of
                            Indonesia. The visit to the various countries had therefore been very
                            useful for the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked the Minister
                            to comment, if he would, on the recent developments in Indonesia. The
                            Minister said that when President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> left Indonesia in late April on his present
                            tour, the assumption had been that the Assembly would adopt the 1945
                            Constitution. The political parties had agreed to the return to the 1945
                            Constitution last February. The only exceptions expected then were the
                                <gloss target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> also had some doubts as to the desirability of
                            returning to the 1945 Constitution although for its own purposes it was
                            giving the Constitution its support in the Assembly. At a Cabinet
                            meeting on February 19, the <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> had agreed
                            to support the adoption of the Constitution and it was expected until
                            the last moment that they would do so. The position taken by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> in the Assembly therefore had come as a
                            surprise to both <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>. The change in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NU1">NU</gloss> position was due primarily to the
                            absence of <persName corresp="#p_CI4">Chalid</persName> from the country
                            immediately prior to the voting. The Minister said that it is debatable
                            whether a two-thirds majority is necessary in such a case or whether a
                            simple majority can approve the return to the 1945 Constitution. The
                            Assembly will now go into recess with the vote not being considered
                            final and will await the return of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Instructions were sent to
                            Djakarta to keep the situation calm and to limit political activities.
                            In the meantime the present Government will stay in power. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is confident that
                            he can solve the problem even if a compromise is necessary on the
                            Djakarta Charter.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0418"/>
                        <p>The Minister said that President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> is determined to return to the 1945 Constitution
                            and to direct the Government himself. The President is more than ever
                            convinced he wants to get definite results for the people and feels that
                            the country has been experimenting too much already. The President and
                            the Indonesians are proud that to date they have kept the country from
                            disintegration. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            commented that the Indonesians do indeed have a great deal to be proud
                            of and have achieved a great deal in the short period since their
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>The trip to Latin America and to the United States has been inspiring and
                            helpful. The Minister said he feels that as a result, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> should visit the
                            United States each year in order to see the situation in this country as
                            it really is. The President has an image of the United States which is
                            different from the actual situation. Indonesia has developed to such a
                            point, the Minister said, that no ideological or military dictatorship
                            would be possible. Only a <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> dictatorship would be possible, but the
                            President has repeatedly refused to assume such powers in the past.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> again referred to
                            the progress made in Indonesia. He commented that he can easily
                            understand the impatience of Asians for improving their standard of
                            living, adding that he is always impressed by what has been accomplished
                            in Asia in just a few years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we have
                            been very pleased at our improving relations and that we are especially
                            happy to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>,
                            who understands and likes Indonesians, in Djakarta. The Ambassador and
                            the United States Government, he said, both wish to improve
                            U.S.-Indonesian relations. The Minister said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is very fond of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName>, not only as the
                            representative of the United States but as a personal friend.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Randy</hi>: I appreciate the thoughts which you
                            have set forth in your letter of May 18, 1959 on our Indonesian arms
                            program and its effect on our relations with the Netherlands and on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d206fn1"><ref target="#d200">Document 200</ref>.</note>
                            <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0419"/>We have, as you know,
                            thoroughly reviewed a number of these points during our discussions here
                            in April, and I shall not comment again on all of them in detail at this
                            time. As for responding to your points concerning the Dutch contribution
                            to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the psychological effects
                            on the Alliance, I shall defer to <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>. I
                            would, however, like to offer a few selected views, some of which I have
                            voiced before but which bear repeating.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the current Dutch concern over increased Western arms sales to
                            Indonesia, recent reports from Paris and other European posts indeed
                            indicate a pick-up in such sales. I do not, however, regard this as an
                            unfavorable development as far as our policy toward Indonesia and the
                            achievement of free world objectives in that country are concerned.
                            While these sales are perhaps substantially the result of commercial
                            pressures, they may also in part reflect a growing confidence in
                            Indonesia’s future on the part of these suppliers. I believe this is
                            particularly true in the case of the United Kingdom. The participation
                            of Western countries as suppliers to Indonesia in effect tends to
                            broaden the base of free world influence there, which is much to be
                            desired from our point of view. [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of source
                                text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>At no time during the discussions here over the past several months did
                            we envisage that other free world countries would not furnish some arms
                            to Indonesia. You will recall, I am sure, that the “sole supplier”
                            concept (the United States alone or in concert with one or more other
                            countries) of arms deliveries to Indonesia was firmly rejected by the
                            Department. I might add that some of these countries which have recently
                            announced their intention of furnishing arms to Indonesia are historical
                            suppliers of Indonesia’s military requirements over the past several
                            years.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that the present flurry of Western arms sales to
                            Indonesia can be considered unrestrained [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. Furthermore, the weak Indonesian
                            foreign exchange position is, I believe, a built-in restraint against
                            promiscuous purchasing from Western sources.</p>
                        <p>But more important—and I cannot make this point more forcefully—a denial
                            of Western sources of military equipment for Indonesia will lead to
                            Indonesia’s turning completely to the bloc for these requirements. Since
                            the beginning of 1958, Indonesia has purchased about $250 million of
                            foreign arms, about three-quarters of which are coming from the bloc.
                            Given this current imbalance and the possibility of continued Indonesian
                            purchases from the bloc, I do not believe that we can reasonably say
                            that continued moderate Western arms shipments will do much to tip the
                            scales in favor of an Indonesian military action against West New
                            Guinea. Military shipments by the United States and other free world
                            countries to Indonesia have afforded the free world a foot-hold <pb
                                n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0420"/>in Indonesia through which we
                            have been able to exercise a considerable deterrent to any Indonesian
                            aggressive action against West New Guinea. The removal of this free
                            world foothold would weaken the deterrent and could easily open the way
                            for a Communist-inspired drive against that island.</p>
                        <p>As for your suggestions on ways to reduce the dangers in this situation,
                            I would offer the following views: <list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item><gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has posed no objection to
                                    Dutch purchases of United States military equipment at “surplus”
                                    prices provided in any such transaction it is not stated that
                                    such equipment is for use in West New Guinea. I do, however,
                                    continue to have serious reservations about the desirability
                                    (and the real necessity) of a large influx of United States arms
                                    into West New Guinea and the real possibility that this could
                                    undermine our accomplishments to date in Indonesia and create
                                    further tensions between the Indonesians and the Dutch which
                                    could readily lead to the precise incident which the Dutch
                                    fear.</item>
                                <label>2)</label>
                                <item>As you know, our present military program to Indonesia is on a
                                    “limited and continuing” basis contingent on future developments
                                    in Indonesia. However, in the event of some markedly favorable
                                    change in Indonesia in the coming months (or even years), I
                                    would not rule out the possibility that we might wish to
                                    consider a substantial increase in the present limited level of
                                    our assistance. As for what are and are not “offensive” weapons,
                                    I am sure you are aware of the difficulty in trying to arrive at
                                    an acceptable definition of this term. There comes to mind the
                                    recent Danish decision to furnish 5,000 machine guns to
                                    Indonesia to which the Dutch offered no objection. In the view
                                    of some “military experts” machine guns might be considered
                                    considerably more “offensive”—as regards possible use in West
                                    New Guinea—than, for example, a World War II subchaser which the
                                    Dutch apparently consider in the “offensive” category.</item>
                                <label>3)</label>
                                <item>Finally, I would not agree with you that we have not been
                                    adequately forthcoming in dealing with the Dutch. We have
                                    informed them in advance of our government-to-government sales
                                    and of the more significant export licenses issued. This is, of
                                    course, primarily Livie Merchant’s concern, but I cannot help
                                    but feel that in our sometimes precipitous and “bits and pieces”
                                    notifications to the Dutch, we have perhaps inadvertently tended
                                    to play up our arms deliveries to Indonesia out of all
                                    proportion to their significance, which has only led to
                                    increasing Dutch concern. Advance notification to the Dutch on
                                    the issuance of all export licenses would, I am afraid, only
                                    worsen this situation. For your information, over the past year
                                    we issued approximately 140 export licenses for shipments of
                                    Munitions List items to Indonesia—everything from a few dollars
                                    worth of aircraft parts to the ten C–130B’s. We have, in fact,
                                    issued hundreds of such licenses for Indonesia since <pb n="395"
                                        xml:id="pg_395" facs="0421"/>1950. Advance notification to
                                    the Dutch, in addition to the problem of overemphasis cited
                                    above, would be a highly impractical operation. I also have my
                                    doubts whether such detailed involvement of another country in
                                    the United States Government’s licensing operation would be
                                    desirable or appropriate.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I have tried to address myself frankly to the above problems and offer
                            you my honest views on them. I am convinced that our present policy
                            toward Indonesia is the correct one and the one most likely to lead to a
                            realization of our objectives there. Progress over the past year has
                            been heartening and there is a good prospect of additional gains
                            although we cannot expect miracles overnight. Progress in countries such
                            as Indonesia is better measured over a period of years or even decades
                            rather than weeks or months. At the same time I wish to assure you that
                            we in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> are most cognizant of the
                            difficulties in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> over this question
                            of arms deliveries to Indonesia and I hope that we will continue to have
                            the benefit of your helpful counsel in this matter.</p>

                            <p rend="center">INDONESIAN FOREIGN POLICY REAPPRAISAL</p>
                            <p>Despite chronic internal political crises, continuing Cabinet
                                changes, and eight Foreign Ministers in as many years, Indonesian
                                foreign policy has been remarkably constant. Since independence, the
                                Indonesian people and their governments have accepted as the
                                foundation of their foreign policy a principle and a
                                cause—non-involvement in either major power bloc and pursuit of
                                Indonesia’s claim to West New Guinea. Further there can be no doubt
                                that Indonesia will in the future continue to press its irredentist
                                claim and continue to pay lip service to an “active and independent”
                                foreign policy. There is increasing evidence, however, that
                                Indonesian leaders are beginning to question the adequacy of a
                                policy dominated completely by the essentially negative concept of
                                non-involvement and the obsessive quarrel with the Dutch over West
                                Irian, and to weigh the relevance of this policy to the problems
                                which their country must face in the Far East in the coming decades.
                                The insistent question which has prompted this reappraisal seems
                                clearly to be, “What and who is to stand between us and a militant
                                and expansionist China?”</p>
                            <p>Without attempting to make a comprehensive list, the more obvious
                                indications in recent months of this reappraisal have been: <list>

                                        Embassy has pointed out that these actions have been part of
                                        a general movement against all Chinese. The Indonesian
                                        military, and to a lesser degree the civil leaders, have
                                        long shown concern over the potential fifth column danger of
                                        Indonesia’s relatively small, but strategically placed,

                            <p>The reasons for this gradual focusing of attention on Communist China
                                as an Indonesian security problem are equally evident. A steady
                                stream of Indonesians have returned from China impressed by the
                                militant dynamism of the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>. A

                                riots, the Sino-Burmese border dispute, have had presumably a
                                gradual cumulative effect. (This appraisal was written prior to the
                                Tibet incident which undoubtedly has intensified considerably
                                Indonesian doubts about the peaceful intentions of Communist China.)
                                Perhaps most important of all is the probable influence of
                                Indonesian military thinking. General Simatupang as far back as 1954
                                pointed out in his book “Pioneer in War, Pioneer in Peace” that
                                Burma’s security problem today will be Indonesia’s tomorrow.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> in 1955 wrote
                                that in terms of national self-defense Indonesia’s cherished active
                                and independent foreign policy was an unrealistic and potentially
                                dangerous shibboleth, and implied clearly that China was the only
                                significant external threat to Indonesia’s national security.
                                Indonesian military leaders have expressed privately these
                                sentiments to American officials in even more explicit terms from
                                1951 to the present, and while again a desire to please American
                                ears may have played some part, the statements were made with
                                evident sincerity.</p>
                            <p>The Indonesian military is today exercising considerable influence in
                                the political and economic sectors, and it seems logical to
                                anticipate that Indonesia’s foreign policy will also show, sooner or
                                later, the influence of strongly held military views in this
                                field.</p>
                            <p>Projecting this trend into the future, what is the probable direction
                                of Indonesian foreign policy during the coming months and years?</p>
                            <p>We should anticipate, first, Indonesian efforts to strengthen its
                                position with the major Pacific powers. The coming years should
                                witness especially the development of much closer ties between
                                Indonesia and Japan. Both countries have much to gain from such an
                                association, economically as well as politically. World War II
                                animosities and residual fears of repeated Japanese expansion to the
                                south may delay this trend, but Japan and Indonesia are natural
                                trading partners, and as the two major countries on China’s eastern
                                and southern periphery, they have a strong political interest in
                                creating a counterforce to a strong China.</p>
                            <p>Similar factors should also bring about closer Australian-Indonesian
                                relations. Despite the irritant of the New Guinea question,
                                Australia has made a major effort through the Colombo Plan to assist
                                in the establishment of a stable democratic Indonesia. These close
                                Southeast Asian neighbors are faced by the same underlying military
                                and strategic problem, and with the maturation of Indonesia’s
                                foreign policy outlook, even the New Guinea problem may come finally
                                into proper prespective. Australia’s security depends more, in the
                                last analysis, on good relations with a democratic Indonesia than on
                                Western control of West New Guinea. Indonesia, for its part, cannot
                                afford an unfriendly southern neighbor.</p>
                            <p>For the present and foreseeable future, however, the only answer to
                                Indonesia’s question “What stands between us and China” is of course
                                    <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0424"/>the United States.
                                Indonesia has many reasons for maintaining good relations with the
                                United States, but none more important than this one. An Indonesian
                                diplomat once observed privately that he had read that it was
                                initially the British fleet in the 19th Century that had made the
                                Monroe Doctrine possible, and that it was the American fleet today
                                that permitted Indonesia to have an “independent” foreign policy. We
                                should therefore see increasing evidence of Indonesian desires to
                                strengthen its relations with the United States.</p>
                            <p>The question arises of the influence of this trend on Indonesia’s
                                attitude towards <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.
                                Paradoxically, the existence of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                    >SEATO</gloss> may well have impeded the development of such a
                                trend since <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> has in
                                Indonesian eyes a predominantly Western character, and, because of
                                the membership of France and Great Britain, certain colonialist
                                overtones. It appears logical to expect, therefore, continued
                                Indonesian criticism of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                while Indonesia at the same time is working towards the same
                                objective of a deterrent to Communist China.</p>
                            <p>It is clearly in the U.S. interest to follow closely any further
                                signs of this foreign policy reappraisal, and to encourage
                                discreetly such a trend. It is important, however, that we do not
                                attempt to force Indonesia against its will into the broader aspects
                                of the Asian anti-Communist movement. Any rapprochement between
                                Indonesia and the Republic of China is highly unlikely, and close
                                relations between Indonesia and the Republic of Korea are equally
                                improbable. As noted above, Indonesia will continue to remain aloof
                                from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. We should also not
                                expect Indonesia to take a forthright stand against international
                                communism. The appeal of the active and independent foreign policy
                                will remain strong, and Indonesia’s policy reorientation, in its
                                first phase at least, will be directed more against China as such
                                rather than against communism.</p>
                            <p>If the foregoing analysis is valid, and this trend should develop, it
                                would mark a welcomed maturing of Indonesia’s international outlook
                                and contribute materially to the attainment of free world objectives
                                in the Far East.</p>

                            <p>Through the years since independence there has been generally
                                convincing evidence that Indonesian policy towards the U.S. has been

                                considerable popular good will. The Indonesians know that the U.S.

                                generally give us credit for honest motives.</p>
                            <p>Despite this significant area of understanding and sympathy, however,
                                there are certain elements in the Indonesian image of the United
                                States which hamper the growth of closer relations, and make it
                                difficult for them to look wholeheartedly towards us for leadership.
                                Indonesians find little if anything worth preserving in their
                                pre-independence past. It represents to them domination,
                                exploitation, and individual humiliation, and they continue even
                                after independence in strong emotional rebellion against it.
                                Further, the economic condition of the masses of the Indonesian
                                people today does nothing to recommend the old economic order. The
                                Indonesian, next to national independence, cherishes most the idea
                                of industrial progress and economic development, and he is prepared
                                to sacrifice much to achieve these goals. The United States,
                                however, has come to be regarded as the principal defender of the
                                status quo, insufficiently aware of and not entirely in sympathy
                                with Indonesia’s desire to break away from the past as sharply and
                                as quickly as possible. They see us as a nation clinging to a
                                moribund economic order and unwilling to take a clear and
                                unequivocal stand on colonialism, and while grateful for our past,
                                present, and future economic aid, they tend to see it motivated more
                                by a desire to defend and preserve the old political and economic
                                order than to help usher in the new. Repudiation of the past and a
                                bright dream for the future account for much of the appeal of
                                communism in Indonesia, but even those Indonesians who reject the
                                Communists’ claim that they are the wave of the future have not been
                                able to find in our actions and statements any alternative which to
                                them provides sufficiently bold and dynamic ideas and programs with
                                which to attack the economic and social problems facing them. (This
                                theme emerges frequently in Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>’s American Association
                                speech early this year.)</p>
                            <p>There are certain aspects of U.S. life which adversely affect
                                U.S.-Indonesian relations and which are not susceptible to rapid or
                                easy change. Our race problem is perhaps the most notable in this
                                category. The above noted image of the United States as a static,
                                anti-progressive force, however, has been allowed to develop despite
                                the facts in the case, and can be remedied not by more money for
                                Indonesia, but by an effort to place our present aid to Indonesia
                                and other underdeveloped countries in a different framework and
                                context. It is difficult to define precisely the nature of this new
                                context, but it should have the same elements of idealism,
                                humanitarianism, boldness, and dynamism which existed in the
                                original <persName corresp="#p_GM3">Marshall</persName> Plan, in
                                Point Four, and—in the domestic sphere—in the New Deal. The irony of
                                the situation is that we are and have been for some time embarked on
                                such a program in Indonesia, but <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400"

                                Indonesia</hi></p>
                            <p>Since 1952 U.S. policy towards Indonesia has been strongly influenced
                                by our increasing concern over the growth in strength of the
                                Indonesian Communist Party. Prior to 1955 non-Communist Indonesians,
                                apprised of this concern, were prone to pooh-pooh the danger and
                                brush our warnings aside as American anti-Communist emotionalism.
                                However national elections in that year and Javanese provincial
                                elections in 1957 proved to them all too clearly that our fears were
                                well grounded. Despite this clear evidence of a progressively
                                greater Communist threat, there appeared to be, however, no person
                                or organization prepared to take forthright counter action, and we
                                began to cast about with an increasing sense of urgency for some
                                individual or movement that would assume this task. When those we
                                had identified as anti-Communist—<persName corresp="#p_HDM1"
                                    >Hatta</persName>, the Sultan of Djokjakarta, Police
                                Commissioner Sukanto—also refused to act, our feeling of desperation
                                increased, and when the <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Young</persName>
                                colonels in December of 1956 repudiated the central government’s
                                authority we transferred to them our sympathy and hopes as the
                                saviors of Indonesia.</p>
                            <p>In the cold light of hindsight there were several basic errors in our
                                appraisal of the situation. We underestimated the strength of
                                anti-Communist forces on Java that remained loyal to the central
                                government, especially the army, and we overestimated both the
                                military and political capabilities of the colonels to succeed in
                                their challenge of central authority. If in February 1958, at the
                                time of the <gloss target="#t_PRRI1">PRRI</gloss> ultimatum to the
                                central government, an estimate had been required of the situation
                                in Indonesia in February 1959 based on the premise of a quick and
                                complete military defeat of the rebels, we could have predicted
                                little less than an Indonesia hostile to the West and under more or
                                less complete Communist domination. Instead we have a situation
                                which while grave in many aspects is far better than anything we
                                would have any right to expect if the best intelligence estimates of
                                1957 had been entirely valid. Finally, we overestimated the strength
                                of anti-communism as a primary motivating and unifying factor among
                                the various groups in armed opposition to the central government.

                                Atjehnese in North Sumatra were and are unquestionably
                                anti-Communist. However, regional interests, personal rivalries, and
                                religious differences proved to have greater strength than
                                anti-Communist sentiment, and neither military support nor other
                                diversionary activities were forthcoming during the <gloss

                                noteworthy that the Sulawesi wing of the <gloss target="#t_PRRI1"
                                    >PRRI</gloss> did not begin its air attacks until after the fall

                                        party affiliations, and personal and family hostilities and

                                    <item>We have been perhaps too inclined to view Indonesian
                                        public personalities as either heroes or villains, and to
                                        endow automatically those of known anti-Communist views with
                                        intelligence, maturity, political sagacity, and the other

                                        them to oblivion and look about for new champions. Our
                                        policy towards Indonesia has thus acquired on occasions a

                        <p>Seemingly then we have only limited freedom of action in dealing with

                                >Sukarno</persName> with right sort of pressures; we must continue

                            count on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> friendship and support and
                            that we are not attempting to dictate internal or external policies.</p>
                        <p>This is what we have been doing for nearly a year with some success. Fact
                            that we may have to expect temporary setback resulting from present
                            situation, with relative position of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            enhanced, should not tempt us to embark on new, unorthodox methods for
                            mere sake of change. Our cue now is to remain alert for developments
                            capable of exploitation while recognizing that in so complex a
                            situation, trends may not uninterruptedly flow in our favor.</p>

                        <p>In the long run we have good ground for optimism because of the political
                            leadership, including <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            himself. The underlying antagonism of not only the Moslem but
                            nationalist parties toward communism and all its works, the
                            determination of army leadership to prevent a Communist take-over and
                            our own capability to encourage and strengthen these elements are
                            dependable assets.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, I am convinced that, considering all factors, our present
                            policy of gradually increasing economic, military assistance, coupled
                            with continuing efforts to build Indonesian confidence in West, exploit

                            the time being. At same time we should not be deterred from doing that
                            much by temporary deterioration of political, economic situation which
                            likely occur next few months.</p>

                                >Sukarno</persName> proposed that Indonesia return to its 1945
                            Constitution in order to (1) rekindle the revolutionary fervor and unity
                            of that year and (2) stabilize Indonesian government and politics. After
                            more than a month’s debate, the proposal failed on three successive
                            ballots (May 31, June 1, June 2) to win the necessary two-thirds
                            majority in the Constituent Assembly. The Islamic parties voted solidly
                            against the proposal because the 1945 Constitution lacks explicit
                            provisions recognizing Islam as the pre-eminent religious faith of
                            Indonesia.</p>

                        <p>Following the defeat of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s proposal, the Army Chief of Staff, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, acting in his
                            capacity as War Administrator under the existing State of Emergency, on
                            June 2 banned all political activity in Indonesia as tending to
                            exacerbate tensions prejudicial to law and order. He took this action on
                            instructions from <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>,
                            then in Los Angeles on his world tour. While banning political activity,
                            the Army denied having any intention of taking over the reins of
                            government. Nevertheless, it is evident that the Army is prepared to
                            intervene actively in the political sphere in order to prevent further
                            deterioration of the political situation.</p>
                        <p>It is generally expected that there will be no further important
                            developments in the Indonesian political situation until <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> returns to the country June
                            28. We have been told by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> is confident he can resolve the differences with
                            the Moslem parties which led to defeat of his proposal in the
                            Constituent Assembly and find a mutually agreeable way to return to the
                            1945 Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy at Djakarta estimates that, while imposition of the 1945
                            Constitution by Presidential decree remains a possibility, it is more
                            likely the President will work out a compromise formula involving
                            concessions of some sort to the Moslem position. The Embassy looks for
                            the present government thereupon to resign and be replaced by a
                            government in which the principal roles will be played by <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself, the Army, the

                        <p>The Embassy’s guess is that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> will proclaim the 1945 Constitution by
                            Presidential decree, probably incorporating in the preamble some
                            reference to Islam which would at least partially meet the Moslem
                            parties’ demand for preferential status for Islam. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might ask Parliamentary
                            endorsement of his decree to meet the letter of legality.</p>
                        <p>There is no apparent reason for the U.S. to view with alarm the return to
                            the 1945 Constitution in Indonesia. In fact, there is some hope <pb
                                n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0434"/>that this change might bring
                            increased political stability and more effective measures to check the
                            deterioration of the economy, developments the U.S. would welcome.</p>
                        <p>Ideally the U.S. would like to see the return to the 1945 Constitution
                            accomplished by legal and democratic means. None of the means thought
                            likely to be employed is fundamentally undemocratic, and the Indonesians
                            will probably make every effort to meet at least the letter of the law.
                            In any case, the hoped-for gain in political stability might well
                            counterbalance the disadvantage of any departure from wholly legal
                            procedure as far as overall U.S. interests are concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is the practical steps which might be taken after the reinstatement of
                            the 1945 Constitution, rather than the act of reinstatement itself,
                            which could ultimately lead the U.S. to consider modification of its
                            policy towards Indonesia. However, the actions we expect the Indonesian
                            Government to take are generally those which would further our
                            objectives. It is anticipated that the new government under the 1945
                            Constitution, would be heavily weighted with representatives of
                            anti-Communist elements, notably the Army.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as it is the Moslem parties which have opposed <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s proposal to return to the
                            1945 Constitution, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            will continue to depend in part on Communist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) support in his move to reinstate the
                            1945 Constitution. This is not expected to result in <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> participation in the Government, but it
                            could result in the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> continuing to
                            enjoy its substantial popular influence and relative freedom to pursue
                            its ends.</p>
                        <p>Even if the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> remains in this
                            advantageous position, however, the U.S. would gain nothing by a change
                            in existing policy. Our Embassy strongly recommends that, whatever the
                            outcome of the present crisis (short of marked Communist gains or
                            general civil disorder, of course) the U.S. should simply maintain its
                            present policy of strengthening non-and anti-Communist elements (1) in a
                            material sense through judicious economic and military assistance, and
                            (2) in a psychological sense by showing the U.S. to be a dependable
                            friend of Indonesia. The Ambassador recommends further that we should
                            continue to exploit Indonesian fears of international Communist
                            expansionism.</p>
                        <p>I concur in these recommendations.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">The

                        <p>There is no apparent reason for the U.S. to view with alarm the
                            reinstatement of the 1945 Constitution. In fact, if this change produces
                            a more stable, non-Communist government and results in firmer measures
                            to check the deterioration of the economy, U.S. objectives in Indonesia
                            will be served. As a matter of internal political reorganization in
                            Indonesia, the change of constitutions as such need have no effect on
                            U.S. policy towards Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>It is true, of course, that political developments in Indonesia attendant
                            on implementation of the 1945 Constitution could necessitate a
                            reexamination of U.S.-Indonesian relations. The Communist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) has supported <persName

                            of the 1945 Constitution so he remains to some extent dependent on
                                <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> support, particularly if the
                            Moslem parties remain uncooperative. However, we do not expect
                            Communists to be included in the new cabinet, and we do expect the
                            anti-Communist Army leadership to be substantially represented therein.
                            And we have been led to believe that the Army and certain civilian
                            elements of the government intend to use the increased executive power

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> of Australia had assured the
                            Dutch of strong support in New Guinea, but he noted that the Australians
                            can go no further in the military field than permitted by the United
                            States. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then went on to
                            say that he was worried about Indonesia’s intentions in New Guinea and
                            the Dutch were preparing a statement [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] concerning the amount of arms
                            which the Indonesians had acquired from Western sources. So far, the
                            political deterrent exercised by the United States had worked, but Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> was concerned that if
                            the Indonesians did attack there were no arrangements for the Dutch to
                            obtain any military help from their Western allies. He urged that the
                            United States strongly continue to exert a political deterrent. The
                            Secretary recalled a recent Indonesian statement that they had no
                            intention of attacking New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then turned to the
                            question of obtaining U.S. surplus weapons for the Dutch forces. He
                            asked the Secretary’s support in obtaining the items on the revised list
                            which the Dutch had submitted in response to U.S. suggestions to replace
                            the earlier list.<note n="1" xml:id="d213fn1">The revised Dutch list was

                            the Dutch particularly wanted a tanker. He hoped that the price of the
                            arms sold would be merely token. He would hate to have a situation
                            develop wherein the Netherlands would have to divert funds from their
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> effort for the defense of New
                            Guinea. He noted in this connection that there were some 18,000 Dutchmen
                            there whom it was his duty to protect. He thought that if the
                            Indonesians thought the West considered the island vital to defend, they
                            would be deterred from attacking. He then remarked that there were still
                            2,800 Dutch left in Indonesia, but he wouldn’t be surprised if they
                            would soon be forced to leave. The Indonesians keep saying that they
                            would pay compensation for the properties they had taken from Dutch
                            interests, but they did nothing. The Secretary remarked that during the
                            consideration of our aid program, an amendment had been introduced and
                            adopted in committee that there would be no aid supplied to countries
                            who had confiscated private property.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2"

                            might well apply in the case of Indonesia. The Secretary then asked Mr.

                            being impossible to go beyond this in absence Congressional approval. We

                        <p>A new government took office in Indonesia on July 10 under the
                            Premiership of President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> who thus becomes head of government as well as
                            head of state. The new Cabinet retains the principal figures from the
                            previous government, including <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName>, formerly Premier but now First Minister under
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>, who stays on as Foreign
                            Minister. Army Chief of Staff <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> assumes a place in the Cabinet for the first
                            time as Minister of Security and Defense. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> describes the new Cabinet
                            as a “working” Cabinet which will deal with the country’s basic problems
                            in a non-partisan spirit. Cabinet appointees have been required to
                            divest themselves of responsibility to political parties to which they
                            may belong.</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of United States interests and objectives in
                            Indonesia, the new Cabinet represents an improvement over its
                            predecessor, even though <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> have made it clear that Indonesia’s neutralist
                            foreign policy will continue. No known extreme leftists occupy positions
                            in the “nucleus”, or inner, cabinet, in which the anti-Communist
                            leadership of the Army is strongly represented. The inner Cabinet can be
                            characterized as technically competent, and, on the basis of its
                            membership, more conservative in political orientation than the previous
                            Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Designation of the new ministers follows a revised ministerial setup. The
                            complete Cabinet, consisting of 38 ministers occupying 43 posts (see Tab
                            A for Cabinet list and Tab B for biographic data on inner Cabinet
                                members)<note n="1" xml:id="d215fn1">See Supplement for both
                                tabs.</note> is composed of (1) an inner Cabinet of nine full
                            ministers, (2) deputy ministers who serve under the inner Cabinet
                            ministers, and (3) a group of ex-officio ministers who are heads of
                            certain government agencies other than ministries. This organizational
                            structure centers control in the more conservative inner Cabinet, thus
                            providing the means to restrain the few fellow travelers (and one
                            possible Communist) included among the deputy ministers. At the same
                            time, Army officers have been placed in some key deputy minister posts
                            dealing with labor, communications and economic matters.</p>

                        <p>The new government has, in theory, a freer hand to tackle some of the
                            country’s basic problems—such as the continuing rebellion and the
                            spiraling inflation—than any previous government. It takes office under
                            the 1945 Constitution, which was reinstated July 5 by Presidential
                            decree to replace the Provisional Constitution of 1950. The 1945
                            Constitution provides for a Presidential Cabinet with an assured life of
                            five years, in contrast to the previous Parliamentary Cabinets which
                            proved weak and unstable. Only time will tell whether the new government
                            can and will capitalize on its relative insulation from political
                            haggling and give the country effective leadership. The outcome of the
                            experiment will depend in large degree on the performance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who, as the avowed head of
                            a “working” Cabinet, must show unaccustomed willingness to shoulder
                            administrative responsibility if the new government is to have a good
                            chance of success.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">The Embassy in Djakarta

                        <p>174. Also for <gloss target="#t_POLAD1">POLAD</gloss>. Out of welter of
                            confusion and conflicting interests accompanying revision of structure
                            Indonesian Government and appointment of new Cabinet, two things emerge
                            clearly. First is that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> feels he has achieved or is on way to achieving
                            balance of power factors which he considers essential to maintain his
                            position. The second is that there is at last awareness that something
                            must be done about deteriorating financial and economic situation and an
                            apparent determination to do the necessary even if adoption of
                            politically unpopular measures is required.</p>
                        <p>With regard to first, this is of course way in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has always operated.
                            Balancing one man off against another, one group <pb n="415"
                                xml:id="pg_415" facs="0441"/>against another, has been the key to
                            his political strategy. As Department aware, this was what gave <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> its opportunity to stage a comeback
                            when <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> some years ago
                            saw black cloud of <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> looming
                            on political horizon as direct threat to his own position. This is also
                            reason <persName corresp="#p_HDM1">Hatta</persName> and Sjahrir are on
                            sidelines, reason <persName corresp="#p_NM2">Natsir</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS7">Sjafruddin</persName> are in Sumatra. For
                            balancing one political force against another neutralizes both and leads
                            not to decision and action but to indecision and inaction, with
                            consequent failure to face up to and attack problems facing country.</p>
                        <p>Today <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has succeeded in
                            establishing somewhat precarious balance between Army and <gloss

                            poses greatest threat to his preeminence. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> recognizes, of course, that
                            ultimately this balance may be upset, that he is dealing with an
                            ambitious man in <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> but so
                            far he does not fear him because presumably he still has power to
                            destroy him and he needs him. <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> has demonstrated capacity to temper ambition
                            with restraint.</p>
                        <p>Reason previous Cabinet, so-called Karya Cabinet, was able to stay in
                            office as long as it did, its more than two years of service breaking
                            all records for Indonesia, was because it was able to preserve this
                            balance. The government rested on a tripod of three men—<persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>. This triumvirate has been
                            continued in new Cabinet. For time being at least, each man is dependent
                            upon the other. <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> does not
                            count in the power struggle of course. He is simply a dedicated man
                            trying to do a job for his country but therein lies his greatest
                            strength because <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            knows he is no rival for power and is willing to trust him—to an extent
                            he probably trusts no other man—to run government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> likewise appears to have same
                            feeling about <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Visitors to Indonesia continue to ask me this question—what has brought
                            about change in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>? The
                            situation has changed so that it is no longer to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s interest to play game the
                            way he played it before. If <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> sees threat coming from another direction, he
                            will change his course again.</p>
                        <p>This raises question as to how long <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            alliance can continue. Answer, in my view, is a simple one—just so long
                            as <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> controls army but
                            still lacks power to unseat President. The moment <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> acquires such power <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will move against him
                            unless <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> moves first.
                            This is an uneasy alliance between two strong men—each strong in a
                            different way. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, the
                            superb politician, the beloved of the masses, versus <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, the tough soldier, the
                            brilliant commander. If they can continue to work together, much can be
                            accomplished for the good of the country. Claws of <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> can be clipped, an open field can be

                            not out of question, as, unfortunately, neither is also a lapse into
                            chaos with resultant emergence of <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> as
                            dominant force although this latter possibility, while ever present, is
                            in my view much less likely than two years or year ago.</p>
                        <p>To prevent military solution at least until he himself wants one, and to
                            assist in preserving balance within military, <persName

                            money on <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty with military solution to Indonesian problem is that while
                            this may be temporarily effective in advancing <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> objectives through curbing Communists there is no more
                            assurance that a military regime will be able find its way through maze
                            of economic and financial difficulties than its civilian predecessors
                            could. And there is no present indication that military are likely to be
                            any less tempted by fatal lure of corrupt practice than have civilians.
                            And should military fail, what then?</p>
                        <p>Indonesian attitudes today in economic field provide remarkable parallel
                            to political attitudes year and half ago. At that time Indonesian
                            leadership was just beginning to be acutely aware of fact that Communism
                            within country represented a real threat to continued freedom and
                            independence of Indonesian people. Today same leadership has become
                            aware of new danger—inflation—and they are beginning to see that
                            economic instability can not only threaten a better life for their
                            people but that it also presents a situation ready-made for Communist
                            exploitation.</p>
                        <p>I have been anticipating a direct bid from Indonesian Government for more
                            assistance to tide them over this crisis. If and when it comes, I think
                            we should be responsive, always provided they are willing help
                            themselves to extent they are able, even though this means taking some
                            of the hard decisions I have been talking about.<note n="2"

                        <p>After exchange of courtesies and discussion Lockheed matter President
                            ordered coffee and then waited for me to take lead in conversation.</p>
                        <p>I opened by saying I hoped he would not mind if I talked as friend rather
                            than as Ambassador because some of the things I wanted to say had not
                            been discussed with my government and were in context internal affairs
                            rather than external. I referred to deteriorating economic situation in
                            Indonesia, mentioning specific commodity price increases resulting from
                            inflationary pressures. I had been talking with great many people at all
                            levels and I thought he might be interested in receiving my
                            impressions.</p>
                        <p>I was convinced that people of country recognized as he did that some
                            hard decision had to be made to solve economic problems and people were
                            looking to President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            for leadership. There seemed to be general acceptance among people with
                            whom I had talked that unpopular measures were necessary and I thought
                            Indonesians were ready for such measures once they were explained to
                            them. I said in my opinion there was only one man who could explain such
                            program to people and that was himself. As an illustration of what I
                            meant I cited necessity for increasing taxes. This, I emphasized, was
                            unpopular action in any country but if it was necessary to improve
                            condition of people and was explained to them as something from which
                            they would reap benefit, and if it were necessary for good of country, I
                            was confident people would accept it—indeed welcome it.</p>
                        <p>President nodded his head at this point and said he agreed. He wanted me
                            to be more specific, however.</p>
                        <p>I cited through Java that he had to pay four rupiahs a liter for gasoline
                            throughout west and central Java. This was almost four times legal price
                            of gasoline and this was experience not only of Americans but
                            Indonesians. Americans had no objection to paying this price for
                            gasoline which was far lower than they paid at home, I remarked, but it
                            was hard on Indonesian people. Some Indonesian leaders were kidding
                            themselves that legal price of gasoline was real price of gasoline and
                            what people paid. This simply was not true. Meanwhile I emphasized who
                            was getting benefit of this high price—not government, not people, not
                            even producer, only the black market operator who contributed no
                            service. The government could take advantage of situation by increasing
                            prices to point where black market operators would be discouraged and
                            government take additional in taxes.</p>
                        <p>President interjected observation that he was not convinced this would
                            solve black market situation—he believed black market situation could
                            only be solved by additional supply.</p>
                        <p>I said of course this was true, but he could induce additional supply
                            through price increase. I pointed out experience in Germany and other
                                <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0447"/>countries and emphasized
                            that producers and distributors who are not making money on commodities
                            were not only reluctant to sell at losing price but obviously had no
                            interest in additional investment in facilities to insure widespread
                            distribution. I said I was convinced from my own experience that not
                            only could black market commodities situation be solved by this process
                            but that formula could be developed which would (a) benefit Indonesian
                            Government and (b) do so without imposing additional burden on
                            Indonesian people; rather result would be lessening of burden. I
                            observed that this was large subject to deal with in short time (I had
                            been advised that President had only half hour reserved for me this
                            morning), but that I knew cabinet was meeting all day tomorrow to
                            discuss some of these problems and that was reason I had ventured to
                            raise subject at this time. When his government had reached conclusion
                            as to program, I should be glad to sit down and discuss whole situation
                            with him or appropriate Ministers and to listen to any suggestions they
                            might have as to how we might be of help.</p>
                        <p>Possibly indicative of President’s new state of mind was immediate
                            rejoinder—”I am not interested in programs,” he said. “We have had too
                            many programs. I am interested in action.” I said I could not agree more
                            and that that was what I had meant.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that of course program for solution of all Indonesia’s
                            economic problems involved many aspects and one of these was source of
                            capital for development. I said that I had been very glad to see that he
                            had apparently opened door a little wider to private foreign investment
                            in his recent speech on August 17.<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">The

                        <p>President confirmed this. He said he preferred governmental credits but
                            he was willing to have private capital come in. I then said I thought
                            Indonesia would have to depend upon private foreign capital if it was to
                            develop its resources as rapidly as it hoped to do. Many people in
                            Indonesia feared foreign capital. This fear was without foundation. I
                            cited history of development of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            vital role foreign capital had played in this development, pointing out
                            that following our own revolution substantial percentage of our economy
                            was owned and controlled by foreigners. Important point there, I
                            stressed, was that percentage of foreign private investment in America
                            had gone down to about three percent through years but that actual
                            amount of foreign capital invested in America had continued to increase
                            ever since our revolution. What had happened was that America had grown
                            around core of foreign capital which enabled <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> to get start. Indonesia could do same.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>President appeared very much impressed by this point which apparently had
                            never reached him before. He nodded his head slowly and
                            thoughtfully.</p>
                        <p>I was not saying this to him in selfish desire to see more American
                            investment in Indonesia, I said. There was ample investment opportunity
                            for American capital in America and other countries. I was making point
                            solely because I felt it was in Indonesia’s interest to attract and
                            utilize source of capital which could help them solve problems faster
                            than they could solve them otherwise.</p>
                        <p>(President then said he was very much interested in what I had to say and
                            would like to have another talk with me in which we would further
                            develop subject.)</p>
                        <p>In closing conversation I thanked President for his invitation to go with

                        <p>On August 24 the Indonesian Government adopted a series of monetary
                            reforms, including devaluation of the rupiah, freezing of bank accounts,
                            and the reduction of government employee salaries. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJG1">Mein</persName> summarized these reforms in a
                            memorandum of August 31 for <persName corresp="#p_PJG1"
                                >Parsons</persName>. “As for the longer-range effects of these
                            measures,” he observed, “we can expect both deflationary and
                            inflationary results.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                            656D.13/8–3159) See Supplement. The Department of State’s classified
                            periodical, <hi rend="italic">Current Economic Developments</hi>,

                            analysis of the reforms. “These measures,” it noted, “may prove
                            beneficial if they are followed by other economic reforms which add up
                            to a meaningful stabilization program. The measures provide some
                            indication that the Government at last has decided to move to correct
                            the rapidly worsening economic conditions, even to the extent of making
                            politically unpopular decisions. The real test will be the Government’s
                            willingness and ability to institute and implement these and other
                            necessary measures to deal with the serious inflation.” (Issue No. 580,

                            what steps they might take in the event of an Indonesian attack on West
                            New Guinea.<note n="1" xml:id="d221fn1">See <ref target="#d214">Document

                                >Hood</persName> recalled that both our Governments have assured the
                            Dutch of support in the event of an attack but that the nature of such
                            support had not been spelled out other than to suggest that it might
                            well be political and in the field of logistics. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> wondered whether we might
                            not consider having talks, either in <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"
                                facs="0450"/>Washington or elsewhere, on what the United States and
                            the United Kingdom might be prepared to do. <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1"
                                >Lloyd</persName> felt, however, that such talks should be held
                            without the Dutch.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated that we would
                            look into the matter. He commented that the Dutch have been pressing us
                            to hold talks with them but that we have thus far resisted. He said we
                            felt the Dutch have somewhat exaggerated fears concerning the
                            possibility of an Indonesian attack. At the same time we feel that the
                            Indonesians seem to have been taking seriously what we have been saying
                            to them and that the evolution of the Indonesia Government, particularly
                            as regards its general attitude towards the West, has been encouraging.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> stated in conclusion
                            that we would consider the British suggestion and be in further
                            touch.</p>

                                        Pakistan for example and as distinct from special type
                                        agreement concluded with Indonesia Aug. 13, 1958, could
                                        facilitate provision military aid and in some ways would be
                                        advantageous to us, e.g., enabling us to place adequate
                                        mission in Indonesia to work with Indonesian services.
                                        Notwithstanding advantages derivable from standard military
                                        assistance agreement however it important keep in mind that
                                        such agreement would require GOI give assurances contained

                                        (Yugoslavia has in past given such assurances), including
                                        expressed willingness to make full contribution to
                                        “defensive strength of the free world.” Present method of
                                        providing military aid to Indonesia does not require GOI
                                        give such assurances, as you know. While present method of
                                        providing military aid without standard military assistance
                                        agreement is somewhat cumbersome since it requires separate

                            <item>We believe there are three possible risks involved in proposing
                                standard military assistance agreement at this time: (a) We might
                                get adverse reaction from our friends in present government who
                                might then become suspicious of our motives; (b) We would risk
                                creating impression on part GOI that greatly expanded assistance
                                would result from agreement when there is no assurance this would be
                                case; (c) Should we succeed in concluding a standard military
                                assistance agreement we might make difficult the domestic political
                                position of this relatively favorable government to the point of
                                rendering it impotent or even of causing its fall. I know you too

                        <p>The proposals made in Embassy Djakarta’s reference despatches on this
                            subject have been read here with particular interest. We, too, have long
                            felt that some clarification of the U.S. position regarding West New
                            Guinea would benefit U.S. efforts in dealing with the complex of
                            U.S.-Dutch-Indo problems with which we have all been preoccupied during
                            the last two years. The Ambassador has suggested on a number of
                            occasions (e.g., Embtel 1157,<note n="5" xml:id="d223fn5">See <ref

                                prefer that West New Guinea remain under Dutch control. This has
                                merely added force to Dutch determination to hold on, for it is
                                unlikely that without strong <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                pressure, Dutch would voluntarily abandon part of Dutch realm. If

                            helpful when the Department undertakes a new study of the U.S. position

                            ultimately finding some constructive solution of it.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a section summarizing the Dutch position on the West New

                        <p>We fully understand and appreciate the difficulties, inhibitions and
                            obstacles that the West New Guinea problem places in the path of our
                            policy in Indonesia. We recognize also, as Embassy Djakarta has pointed
                            out, that the emotional, political and other aspects of the Indonesian
                            attitude on this subject, no matter how contrived or unrealistic they
                            may be, are nevertheless facts of life which must be accepted and taken
                            into account in determining our position on the New Guinea question in
                            relation to U.S. interests. This same maxim applies, of course, in the
                            case of the Dutch attitude.</p>
                        <p>After reviewing that attitude, we believe it is clear, first, that the
                            proposal made by Embassy Djakarta would not be sufficiently attractive
                            from the Dutch point of view to persuade them to change their position,
                            and, second, that our initiative, as proposed by Embassy Djakarta, would
                            have far more serious consequences—and not alone for U.S.-Dutch
                            relations—than has been foreseen in the reference despatches.</p>
                        <p>In essence, Embassy Djakarta proposes that a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> trusteeship over West New Guinea be established for five
                            years after which the area would go to Indonesia; meanwhile, an
                            agreement would be negotiated between the Netherlands under which the
                            Dutch would receive adequate compensation for the Dutch assets seized by
                            the Indonesians and the progressive removal of discriminatory
                            restrictions on Dutch enterprises in Indonesia. However, such an
                            arrangement is not likely to be viewed by the Dutch as an adequate
                            motive for reversing their position on West New Guinea. So far as they
                            are concerned, their people have been expelled from Indonesia and Dutch
                            investments and enterprises have been “stolen”. They feel strongly that
                            they have a right to receive adequate compensation for their “stolen”
                            assets <hi rend="italic">without</hi> giving up anything more. Moreover,
                            the Dutch have long since made it unmistakably clear that they believe
                            that Indonesians, in attempting to join the question of compensation to
                            their claim to West New Guinea, are engaging in nothing short of
                            blackmail. Consequently, to make a settlement with the Indonesians under
                            which they would simply receive what they would regard as doubtful
                            promises of payment for “stolen property,” would hardly appear to the
                            Dutch as a persuasive reason for agreeing to give <pb n="430"
                                xml:id="pg_430" facs="0456"/>up West New Guinea as well. After all,
                            they were not prepared to give it up in the hope of saving the Dutch
                            businesses in Indonesia which were taken over; and we see nothing to
                            indicate that, now that this has occurred, there is any likelihood of
                            their giving it up in the hope of ultimately salvaging something in the
                            way of compensation to which they feel they are already legitimately
                            entitled.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch stand in this respect constitutes, in our judgment, a classic
                            case in which characteristic Dutch business shrewdness in protecting its
                            own financial interests was obliged to give way to political and moral
                            considerations which, in this “Calvinistic” country, have been
                            considered of greater and more basic importance in shaping national
                            policy. Being forced to make such a policy choice, however, has, if
                            anything, intensified the emotional reaction of the Dutch—the sense of
                            moral outrage—over the expulsion of Dutch nationals from Indonesia,
                            Indonesian treatment of Dutch business interests in Indonesia and the
                            continuing Indonesian campaign linking compensation with their claim to
                            West New Guinea. In these circumstances, therefore, any attempt to
                            persuade the Dutch to accept a settlement along the lines of Embassy
                            Djakarta’s proposals would, in our opinion, be hotly rejected and Dutch
                            protests against such attempts would doubtless find a sympathetic ear
                            among some of our principal allies.</p>
                        <p>In presenting its suggestions for a settlement of the New Guinea
                            question, Embassy Djakarta has anticipated that it “would probably lead
                            to a degree of strain in Dutch-American relations.” We already possess,
                            it seems to us, some standard of measurement by which we may judge just
                            what this degree of strain might be. During the last two years we have
                            enjoyed, in our opinion, the best possible opportunity to observe the
                            strength of Dutch feeling on this subject—namely, their reaction to our
                            military aid program in Indonesia. And this reaction related merely to
                            the <hi rend="italic">potential</hi> danger to West New Guinea which the
                            Dutch fear our arms aid to Indonesia constitutes. But even this reaction
                            brought us perilously close to full-blown and dangerous disagreement
                            bilaterally and within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—a
                            possibility that is still far from being dead. If we should decide to
                            participate in promoting any settlement at this time which envisages
                            turning over West New Guinea to Indonesia, we can only say that the
                            Dutch reaction would be immediate, public, violent and not confined to
                            bilateral channels. It is clear from the foregoing section and depth of
                            feeling from which the Dutch position on West New Guinea springs. Any
                            move on our part which would lead to their displacement in New Guinea
                            would be bitterly and violently resented as an attack on those basic
                            Dutch principles discussed above. Such a move would also rekindle all
                            the latent Dutch bitterness against the U.S. (and presumably the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>) in connection with our policy at the
                            time Indonesia obtained its independence. It is well to recall, in this
                            connection, that the <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0457"/>more
                            senior positions in many government ministries here are held by “old
                            Indonesia hands,” men who remember the good old days when they held top
                            posts in the Dutch East Indies—and who remember also the days when they
                            lost the jobs they had enjoyed so much. It is no exaggeration to suggest
                            that we would be strongly attacked for trying to kick the Dutch out of
                            West New Guinea as we helped to kick them out of Indonesia. After the
                            treatment they have had at Indonesian hands, there would be little doubt
                            in the Dutch mind that they were being abandoned by the U.S. and their
                            interests sacrificed to Indonesian interests as the expedient price of
                            U.S. policy in that area.</p>
                        <p>While such a move on our part would certainly have serious consequences
                            for our bilateral relations with the Netherlands, one cannot ignore the
                            repercussions it would also have elsewhere. While the Department is in a
                            better position to judge this point, it seems to us that any U.S. action
                            along the lines Embassy Djakarta suggests would certainly have great
                            significance for the British, French, Belgian and Portuguese Governments
                            which are also burdened with their own delicate colonial problems,
                            Furthermore, all these countries are members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> and any action, as suggested in the case of one of our
                            staunchest <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, could not fail,
                            we believe, to cause important repercussions within the Western
                            alliance, which is, however one wishes to qualify it, still basic to our
                            major foreign policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>One cannot ignore, either, the impact which the suggested course of
                            action can be expected to have on Australia and on our relations with
                            that country. Embassy Canberra’s reference despatch has already given
                            indications of this probability. While the Australians have expressed
                            their willingness to accept any disposition of West New Guinea mutually
                            agreed by the Dutch and Indonesians, this appears here to have far more
                            the ring of a platitude than it does of any modification, however
                            slight, in their existing bipartisan policy on this subject. There is
                            surely nothing known here to indicate that the Australians want or
                            expect the Dutch to dispose of West New Guinea—to the Indonesians or
                            anyone else except, perhaps, in due course the Papuans. On the contrary,
                            there seems every reason to believe that the Australians fully expect
                            and anxiously want the Dutch to retain sovereignty over West New Guinea.
                            Their anxiety in this respect has now reached the point where it is
                            sometimes difficult for us to determine which of these two is more
                            ardently seeking the other’s support. As this Embassy has reported,
                            Dutch-Australian cooperation in New Guinea has been increasing (Emb

                            the fact that the Dutch and Australians are making every effort to
                            expand their cooperation at all levels and in all areas involved in the
                            administration and development of New Guinea as a whole. (Emb D–17, July

                                    >Ibid</hi>., 033.4356/7–859)</note> In his public statement at
                            the time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MSRG1">Menzies</persName> said, “We
                            agreed that, with the ultimate idea of bringing the indigenous
                            populations to a state of self-government, we should each pursue active
                            policies of improving education, health and communications and the
                            exploration of national resources.” These endeavors, the Embassy
                            understands from the Foreign Office, are to be carried out with
                            increased cooperation between the Dutch and Australian administrators.
                            From these and other indications it seems clear that, in principle and
                            in practice, the policy interests of the Dutch and Australians in New
                            Guinea are becoming so intertwined as to be inseparable in considering
                            any settlement of the future status of West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi></p>
                        <p>Much as we may agree with Embassy Djakarta regarding the desirability of
                            finding a solution for the West New Guinea question, we do not, in view
                            of all the foregoing, see it as a problem of manageable proportions
                            about which the U.S. can do anything constructive in the immediately
                            foreseeable future. Passions have been aroused on both sides and it is
                            as unrealistic, in our opinion, to expect the Dutch to turn over West
                            Guinea to the Indonesians as to expect the Indonesians to restore Dutch
                            properties in Indonesia to their Dutch owners. Consequently, unless we
                            should find that our interests dictate that we should try to force a
                            Dutch-Indonesian settlement of the New Guinea question, we see a period
                            of quiet, during which passions may cool, as the minimum necessary
                            prerequisite to any moves which might have a chance of success in
                            leading to an ultimate settlement of this highly charged issue.</p>
                        <p>By this comment, however, we do not intend to suggest that the U.S.
                            should do nothing. It is still our belief that the U.S. should make a
                            clear determination of its own best interests in this matter and the
                            position those interests dictate as regards future policy
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>For instance, it is our assumption that the U.S. recognizes Dutch
                            sovereignty over Netherlands New Guinea; at least we are not aware that
                            the U.S. has ever challenged it. But is this assumption correct and is
                            it based on any legal finding? It seems to us that one possible course
                            of action to explore, in this connection, is whether U.S. interests
                            would be best served by trying to persuade the Indonesians to give up
                            their opposition to placing the West New Guinea issue before the
                            International Court of Justice or before the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration. If the Indonesians <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0459"
                            />continue to feel that the Dutch are acting illegally in not turning
                            West New Guinea over to them, and if the U.S. believes that a solution
                            to the West New Guinea issue must be found, why, then, should we not
                            urge that it be sought through these recognized and established organs
                            of international law?</p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, the U.S. accepts the Indonesian view that theirs
                            is primarily a political and not a legal claim to West New Guinea, this
                            would, we believe, require a different approach in assessing the U.S.
                            position. In addition to a legal finding on the question of whether we
                            recognize Dutch sovereignty over Netherlands New Guinea, another
                            fundamental starting point, we think, would then be a U.S. determination
                            of the strategic value in Southeast Asia of New Guinea as a whole and
                            Netherlands New Guinea in particular. This determination would seem to
                            be essential before any decision could be made on the political question
                            of whether the U.S. wishes the Dutch to retain control over West New
                            Guinea. Once this political question is decided, it seems to us that the
                            U.S. would then be in a position to begin thinking in concrete terms
                            about what action it should take in relation to the West New Guinea
                            question. It is quite possible, of course, that even after a
                            thorough-going review, the U.S. might decide to make no change in its
                            present policy of trying to skate between the opposing views of the
                            Dutch and Indonesians without becoming involved in the dispute at all.
                            This is, after all, as much a policy as deciding to support the Dutch or
                            the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the outcome, however, this Embassy still believes there are
                            basic questions which require answers, even if, for the time being, they
                            do not change our policy or actions. We are hopeful that the despatches
                            under reference, as well as this one, will prompt a study to produce
                            those answers.</p>

                            continuation of the struggle against all forms of imperialism).</p>
                        <p>The political parties remain uneasy about the implications of “guided
                            democracy,” particularly so since in the new government not only
                            ministers but senior civil servants as well have been directed to sever
                            their ties with parties. The parties are disturbed also by the Army’s
                            strengthened role in the government, although non-Communist parties
                            generally prefer this to greater Communist influence. Apart from the
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName><gloss

                                target="#t_PSI1">PSI</gloss>) parties, which are completely excluded
                            from the executive branch, the Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>) is the one most adversely affected by “guided
                            democracy” thus far. The party’s role in the government is minimal,
                            while the openly anti-Communist Army is strongly represented. Moreover,
                            it seems plain that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            is using the Army as a counterweight to Communist power.</p>
                        <p>The most significant action taken by the new government to date was the
                            announcement on August 24 of drastic monetary reforms calculated to curb
                            Indonesia’s serious inflation (Tab 2).<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note> The ultimate
                            effect of the monetary reforms, which have at least temporarily upset
                            business activity, cannot yet be assessed. The public reaction seems to
                            be one more of bewilderment than resentment, although the government
                            will reap great public disfavor if it does not find means promptly to
                            release frozen funds needed by employers to pay wages. The monetary
                            reforms, <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0461"/>though introduced
                            without consultation with the IMF, may have useful results if
                            followed-up by the tightened fiscal management <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has promised.</p>
                        <p>An earlier assessment of this government as relatively favorable to U.S.
                            interests on the basis of its composition, remains valid. Several
                            ministers have told us the U.S. should welcome this government as highly
                            favorable to U.S. interests, and we expect requests from the Indonesians
                            for expanded military and economic aid. Within reasons, such expanded
                            aid may well be in our interest, but it is unlikely that we need
                            formulate our attitude towards increased aid on the assumption that this
                            government represents the “last chance” for U.S. influence in Indonesia,
                            as a number of Indonesian leaders have hinted is the case.</p>

                            gave my thinking as to the kind of economic aid program which would be
                            adequate. Our objectives, although we clearly are nearer to their
                            realization than a year ago, remain the same—to secure Indonesia from
                            Communist domination through assisting it in the achievement of
                            political and economic stability.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>By and large our problems have shifted in degree and emphasis rather than
                            kind during the last year. Steady economic deterioration during that
                            period has been offset to some extent by improvement in the political
                            situation. The latter has been furthered by consolidation of executive
                            power, with concomitant reduction of power in the hands of political
                            parties and parliament where the high water mark of communism in
                            Indonesia has been reached.</p>
                        <p>While it is not possible to demonstrate that provision of substantial aid
                            to the Indonesian army was entirely responsible for the increased power
                            and intensified pro-Western posture of Indonesian army leaders, there
                            can be no doubt that our aid had considerable influence. Besides giving
                            army leaders new confidence and providing them with means of effective
                            internal security, our aid has helped widen the growing breach between
                            army and <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. As President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the army have drawn
                            closer together, long-run prospect for a head-on clash between <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>, which would greatly assist ultimate achievement of our
                            objectives, has been strengthened. Continued military aid at
                            substantially the current level or slightly higher will be needed to
                            maintain the momentum we have achieved.</p>
                        <p>Evidence that our program, particularly our military aid efforts, have
                            been aimed in the right direction is to be found in character of present
                            government in which leftist influence has been entirely eliminated from
                            inner cabinet, while anti-Communist influence, largely represented by
                            army, has been expanded and strengthened. There is reason to believe
                            present shape of government more nearly in line with specifications of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> than wishes of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, who holds
                            to view Communists should be required share in responsibility for
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Concurrently our economic assistance, even though on a minor scale in
                            terms of problems, has had considerable influence in improving the
                            political climate. As a minimum it has made friends and has helped train
                            Indonesians in many key governmental positions, influencing their
                            orientation toward west. It has also given important development
                            assistance in certain sections of economy such as Gresik cement, power
                            plants, and assistance to ports, railroads, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Greatest danger to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests here is
                            that improvement in political climate may be nullified by failure GOI to
                            solve grave economic problems. While recent monetary measures
                            demonstrated present government capable taking unpopular measures unlike
                            predecessors, resulting situation fraught with new dangers, and so far
                            there is no evidence of coordinated plan for dealing with these.</p>
                        <p>Thus well before 1961 we may be called upon urgently to rescue Indonesian
                            economy from nationalistic folly, and it will be in our interest <pb
                                n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0463"/>to do so even though we will be
                            in good position to say “I told you so.”</p>
                        <p>In meantime our program on economic front must be kept as flexible as our
                            inherent limitations permit. We are not yet in position to move into
                            kind of relationship with Indonesia which would permit most effective
                            use of our resources, and this makes it imperative that whatever we do
                            has maximum benefit. On some occasions in the past, due chiefly to
                            Indonesian domestic political pressures, our assistance programs have
                            become somewhat more diffused than they should have been and in some
                            cases benefits have been partly offset by imposition of unnecessary
                            rupiah costs on a government facing grave inflationary danger, without
                            return of any immediate economic benefit. In future our economic aid
                            should be confined to three general categories: (1) development; (2)
                            technical and professional training or direct technical support of
                            development projects; and (3) fire brigade projects which have
                            overriding political impact or which meet grave immediate crises such as
                            stabilization. I have listed these in order of dollar magnitude. Order
                            of importance could fluctuate with circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Since all <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> programs in Indonesia to date
                            have been primarily political in motivation, problems of coordination
                            have been relatively slight, easily managed at political level. Fair
                            degree of coordination exists with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            programs, Colombo Plan, activities friendly nations, our practice being

                            economic stability in Indonesia but carrying with them grave political
                            danger to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Indonesian
                            interests.</p>

                                >US</gloss> programs. Prospect improving for increasingly aggressive
                            information activity more closely coordinated with indigenous elements
                            such as Indonesian Army.</p>
                        <p>In summary we are dealing here with a situation so fluid that the primary
                            requirement for advancing <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests is
                            flexibility. It would be unwise at this critical point Indonesian
                            history to commit our course to any particular economic, psychological
                            programs. At optimum our effort should be to keep a boxer stance with
                            our weight balanced on both feet so as best to deal with a fast-changing
                            situation. I realize that this picture is not wholly realistic in
                            reference to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> budgetary planning
                            requirements, but it is toward this posture that we should work.</p>
                        <p>For example, if Indonesian monetary and economic stabilization program
                            recently undertaken is to succeed, further steps will have to be taken
                            and these necessarily will include commodity support for program. In
                            addition to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480 possibilities, I
                            believe additional credits for <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0464"
                            />raw materials, spare parts and capital goods to keep production going
                            will be required. Thus I would recommend that in addition to aid
                            programs already approved or under current consideration approximately
                            $50 million be listed for this purpose under “possible requirements” for
                            Indonesian 1961 program. Whether this amount will actually be required
                            will depend upon developments within next weeks or months but it is
                            self-evident rapid action regarding any such support request would be

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said he had told Mr.
                            Wilcox the day before that he expected that Indonesia would bring up the
                            West New Guinea issues next year in the United Nations General
                                Assembly.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">See <ref target="#d267"
                                    >Document 267</ref>.</note> He hoped the United States would
                            support the Dutch position on this matter. He went on to <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0465"/>say that the Dutch position on this
                            question was the same as the French position on Algeria (i.e., the
                            United Nations is not competent to change the territorial status of a
                            member state). If, however, an Indonesian resolution were passed in the
                            United Nations, the Dutch would simply disregard it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then reviewed for the
                            Secretary the history of his talks with Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> in regard to a possible Indonesian
                            attack on West New Guinea. He had told Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> a
                            year ago that the Dutch were very concerned about Indonesian plans to
                            attack West New Guinea. As a result Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> had
                            spoken in very clear terms to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Subandrio</persName> about this question, stressing the point that
                            the United States was against the use of force in the settlement of such
                            issues. This had had the desired effect on the Indonesians. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then expressed his
                            gratification that this political deterrent had been successful in
                            restraining Indonesia from any West New Guinea ventures, although he
                            still felt that this was in the nature of a postponement rather than a
                            change in objectives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then said he would like
                            to have a reaffirmation of U.S. policy in regard to the possible use of
                            force by Indonesia against West New Guinea. He read a copy of the public
                            statement of October 7, 1958 (see memorandum of conversation, Oct. 7
                                [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>], 1958)<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> and asked whether
                            this remained our policy, to which the Secretary replied in the
                            affirmative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> went on to
                            say that there were two aspects or elements to this problem of West New
                            Guinea, the first being the application of the deterrent in time of
                            peace. The second element was the question of what assistance the U.S.
                            was prepared to give the Netherlands in the event an attack actually
                            occurred. He then read the Dutch version of the private assurances Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had given Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> during their conversation on
                            October 7, 1958: (The verbatim Dutch text is as follows: “We are not in
                            a position to make advance statements. I expect that if that occurs we
                            would give you logistical support and find other ways to help. You could
                            count on the same pattern as we have shown in other parts of the world.
                            We acted as you know very vigorously in Lebanon and in the Formosa
                            Straits.”)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then urged that the U.S.
                            take prompt action should an attack occur. Even though the Dutch have
                            virtually nothing left in Indonesia, certain Indonesian leaders still
                            continued to threaten the Dutch. As an example, he cited the fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had recently told
                            the Dutch Chargé in Djakarta that the presence of a Dutch naval ship in
                            Indonesian territorial waters would be a casus belli. The Indonesians
                            apparently now define these waters to cover all inter-island waters. It
                            was this type of Indonesian statement that continued to disturb the
                            Dutch. He felt the <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0466"/>situation
                            needed careful watching. The confiscation of Dutch properties in
                            Indonesia, of course, was a sore point for the Dutch. Many of the
                            refugees were now in West New Guinea, resulting in the presence of
                            18,000 Dutchmen in West New Guinea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> thought Indonesia was now going downhill rapidly,
                            one of the principal reasons therefor being the fact that they will not
                            accept any technical assistance from the Dutch because the Dutch are
                            their whipping boys. This increasingly chaotic situation augmented the
                            danger of Indonesia falling to the Communists. He expressed the complete
                            agreement of his government with the U.S. objective of keeping Indonesia
                            from falling to the Communists. It was a great pity that all this was
                            going on because, in his opinion, there was no basic hostility of the
                            Indonesian people to the Dutch as people as evidenced by the fact that
                            not a single Dutchman had been murdered or hurt in the past few years in
                            Indonesia. It was all caused by the hatred held by the top Indonesian
                            leadership. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> what he thought of the alleged differences between
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on the one hand
                            and <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> and <hi rend="italic"
                                >Nasution</hi> on the other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> replied that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> was the best element in the top leadership.
                            Since all of them were very close friends, however, one could not expect
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> would ever make
                            any move against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the <persName>Dulles</persName> statements and specifically
                            to the mention of logistical support therein, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> asked if we could study ways to
                            help. (It is assumed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> was referring to joint military planning and
                            planning for logistical support.) The Secretary explained that the
                            difficulty in maintaining absolute secrecy in these matters posed a
                            serious problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied
                            strongly that, of course, there would never be any publicity on such a
                            matter. In the case of the “shopping list” for instance, no public
                            mention of the real intended use of the equipment had been made, or ever
                            would be, other than to say that the equipment was intended for “general
                            use.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> asked the
                            Secretary for his help in obtaining the items the Dutch have requested
                            on the shopping list. A discussion ensued in which it was agreed that
                            progress on the shopping list had been made, and that the Department of
                            Defense was trying its best to meet the Dutch requirements. The problem
                            had narrowed itself down to questions of specifications and cost; it was
                            the helicopters that were so expensive. It was also brought out that the
                            items on the list were replacements for deteriorating equipment used in
                            the defense of West New Guinea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said that without our help the Dutch would have to
                            reduce their commitments to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in
                            order to maintain the present minimum level of security forces in West
                            New Guinea. This minimum defense posture was designed to boost the
                            morale of the 18,000 Dutchmen on the island as well as the native
                            Papuans, and to discourage an Indonesian attempt at infiltration.</p>

                        <p>The conversation then turned to an unrelated matter and at this point the
                            Secretary was interrupted by a telephone call. When the Secretary
                            resumed the conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> reaffirmed his understanding that the two elements
                            of U.S. policy regarding a possible attack on West New Guinea as
                            expressed by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> on October 7, 1958,
                            remained unchanged. As he understood our thinking, however, the U.S.
                            reserved its position as regards advance planning. The Secretary replied
                            that we were obliged to reserve on this point. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YP1">Young</persName> made the point that the fact the
                            Dutch had given us all available information on their military
                            establishment in West New Guinea was in a sense a kind of joint planning
                            and would facilitate any U.S. planning in the future. It was important,
                            he went on, for the Dutch to keep us currently informed on all military
                            aspects of this situation.</p>

                                        corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had been treated with
                                    an arrogance and brutality that had left him staggered. He had
                                    come back suggesting that Indonesia should revise its foreign
                                    policy as it related to Communist China. He could not understand
                                    why the Chinese had been as crude as they had been. They had
                                    threatened Indonesia with economic warfare and other unspecified
                                    measures. Discussions at the technical level had also been
                                    heated. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> stated
                                    that, when he had reported his views to the Indonesian Cabinet,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had
                                    supported his position. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>
                                    indicated, however, that he was doubtful whether <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would have gone
                                    this far. In his view it was more likely that <persName
                                        corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had simply told

                                    This affair was in line with the blustering line which Communist
                                    China was taking in many fields. Only yesterday they had
                                    bombarded the Offshore Islands with more shells (227) than at
                                    any time since last March.” (Memorandum of discussion by Robert

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said that the
                            Australian DMI, Col. Macadie, when in Indonesia recently, was approached
                            first by Col. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> and later
                            by General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and asked if
                            he would accept the task of convincing the rebels of the necessity of
                            giving up the struggle. Col. Macadie’s reply on a personal basis to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> served to
                            postpone a decision. Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3"
                                >Casey</persName> handed the Secretary a copy of a memorandum on the

                            of an assessment prepared in Canberra. He said that the conclusion of
                            the paper was that it would not be a good thing for Australia to get
                            mixed up in this. (Copy of memoranda attached.)<note n="1"

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> said that his
                            personal view, based to a certain extent on instinct and after
                            consideration of the matter, was that Australia should not get involved
                            because: (a) Australia does not want the rebels to fold up even if they
                            are not conducting an intensive campaign at the present time; they are
                            the only people in revolt in Indonesia and if they should fold up, there
                            would be no other revolution there; and (b) it would mean Australia
                            involvement in Indonesian domestic affairs which would be misunderstood
                            and might even play into the hands of the Communists. He indicated also
                            that he thought it was in Australia’s interest that the rebellion
                            continue since as long as it serves to keep Indonesian attention on
                            domestic affairs, there is less likelihood of the Indonesians turning
                            against West New Guinea. The Secretary commented that there appeared to
                            be a conflict of interests in the Indonesian approach, since if the
                            rebels fold up, the reasons given by the Indonesians for the purchase of
                            large quantities of military equipment would disappear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRG3">Casey</persName> asked if we had any
                            information on the current status of the rebellion. He was given a brief
                            picture of the present situation in Sumatra and in North Celebes as well
                            as of the reported surrender of Darul Islam elements in the Celebes.</p>

                        <p>The Minister asked whether we had any new information on supplies from

                            was no indication of any new arrangements.</p>

                            <p>It is the policy of the United States Government to encourage a
                                reconciliation between the rebels and the Central Government. We
                                feel that such reconciliation, however, should take place only on
                                the basis of mutually acceptable terms. We would hope that such
                                terms would not mean complete surrender by the dissidents as
                                demanded at this time by the Government. The dissidents still
                                represent an anti-Communist force which cannot be ignored by the
                                Central Government in determining its policies and which could be
                                used as a rallying point should the Communists take over in Java. We
                                would hope, therefore, that any negotiations for settlement of the
                                rebellion would result in attainment of some of the original
                                objectives of the dissidents and in strengthening the anti-Communist
                                forces in Indonesia. The following are some of the reasons for this
                                policy: <list>

                                    <item>Continued P.R.R.I. activity is of primary interest to the
                                        Communists since they thrive on chaos. They have been taking
                                        full advantage of the political differences resulting from
                                        the rebellion as well as of the deteriorating economic
                                        situation in the country.</item>

                                    <item>Continuation of the rebellion will serve only to weaken
                                        further the economy. The expense of the rebellion is
                                        reported to be about one-half of the total budget, which is
                                        a considerable drain of funds. This cost is being met
                                        primarily through the issue of new bank notes, resulting in
                                        growing inflation. This trend will negate any beneficial
                                        effects which might have resulted from the August 24
                                        monetary measures. On the other hand, re-establishment of
                                        the Government’s authority in North and Central Sumatra and
                                        North Celebes, which areas are important foreign exchange
                                        earners, would assist the Government in improving its
                                        foreign exchange position.</item>

                                        the amount of foreign aid which eventually might be
                                        necessary to put Indonesia back on its feet, and since we
                                        presumably would be one of the major sources of such aid, it
                                        would be in our interest that the economic situation not
                                        deteriorate further.</item>

                                        non-Communist and anti-Communist elements to join forces

                                        Indonesia’s suspicions of foreign assistance to the rebels.
                                        The rebels are in very serious trouble and their continuing
                                        ability to carry on for any length of time would only be
                                        interpreted by the Government as an indication that they
                                        were being assisted from outside. This suspicion would be
                                        directed primarily at us, the Republic of China and the
                                        Philippines, making our relations with Indonesia more
                                        difficult.</item>

                                            the postponement of national elections—would also

                                        P.R.R.I. although the rebel movement would likely retain
                                        some psychological influence. However, as the Australians
                                        have pointed out, the P.R.R.I. position is likely to
                                        diminish in any event over the next two or three years. On
                                        the other hand, a settlement would eliminate or at least
                                        substantially reduce the conflict between the two leading

                                    <item>We do not believe that a settlement of the rebellion would

                            <p>To sum up the foregoing comments briefly, a major United States
                                policy guidance is to encourage reconciliation between the rebels
                                and the Indonesian Government. The emergence of the Indonesian Army
                                in the past 18 months as the major anti-Communist force in that
                                country and a number of Army inspired and directed actions during
                                this period have been successful in curtailing and in obstructing
                                Communist political activities in Indonesia. While the growth of the
                                Communist machine has certainly been slowed and possibly halted in
                                some areas, in all likelihood none of its essential parts has been
                                damaged. It appears probable that the Army can continue to contain
                                the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> at least in the short run.
                                However, given the serious continuing political and economic
                                problems created in large part by the rebellion, it does not appear
                                possible for the Army and the Government to take any major steps
                                against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> until these problems
                                are resolved or at least diminished. Thus, in the long run the
                                prospects of achieving United States objectives in Indonesia do not
                                appear to be bright unless and until greater political and economic
                                stability is brought about in that country. In other words, there
                                can be little hope for a permanent reduction of the power of the
                                Communist party unless the chaotic internal situation on which
                                Communism thrives is eliminated. The most significant step which
                                could be taken in this direction at the present time would be a
                                reconciliation of opposing non- or anti-Communist elements,
                                specifically the Army and the P.R.R.I. What we would lose in the
                                diminishing of the power position of one anti-Communist element (the
                                P.R.R.I.) would certainly be more than an equivalent gain in the
                                consolidation and strengthening of anti-Communist forces to meet the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> threat.</p>

                                    >Nasution</persName>’s request is a matter for the Australians
                                themselves to decide. While negotiations between the Indonesian
                                Government and the P.R.R.I. would seem to us to be a matter for the
                                Indonesians themselves, it might be pointed out that such
                                negotiations have taken place off and on over the past several
                                months with no apparent success. The latest attempt to achieve a
                                reconciliation is evidenced by Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_SBG1"
                                    >Sukendro</persName>’s trip to Singapore and Europe to discuss
                                possible terms with rebel representatives. Although the results
                                cannot be predicted, intercession by a third party could possibly
                                pave the way to a settlement. We would perceive no objection to the
                                Australians exploring this matter further if they should so decide.
                                We agree, however, that if the matter is pursued the dissidents
                                should not be pressed to accept the terms at present offered by the
                                Central Government, since this would amount to a surrender and would
                                only undermine the confidence of the P.R.R.I. leaders and other
                                potential rebels in Western support. One problem which might be
                                faced if the Australians should determine to intercede is that the
                                rebel group outside Indonesia which the Australians would approach
                                might not necessarily represent all the rebels still in Indonesia
                                and consequently any terms worked out would not necessarily be
                                accepted by all elements within the P.R.R.I.</p>

                        <p>The programs of military aid approved during the past year contributed
                            significantly to improve U.S.-Indonesian relations. Developments in
                            Indonesia indicate the wisdom of continuing a program of military aid to
                            Indonesia during Fiscal Year 1960 in consonance with the long-range plan
                            developed by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the fact that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1"
                                >Jones</persName> has informed the Minister of Defense and other
                            Government of Indonesia officials that “subject to the availability of
                            funds, the U.S. is planning to continue the government-to-government
                            sale of military equipment and services to Indonesia in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960,” it is deemed appropriate that
                            action be initiated at this time to develop a firm program of military
                            aid for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960.</p>
                        <p>The proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 program currently
                            being developed will include items such as selected artillery items,
                            small arms, ammunition, vehicles, communications, electronics,
                            engineering and medical equipment, small vessels, helicopters and air
                            sea rescue equipment, Air Force supporting equipment, services, training
                            (including training teams) and training equipment and aids.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed that the assistance and services proposed herein will be
                            offered to Indonesia on the same basis as that previously rendered
                            (i.e., token payment in either dollars or local currency) and therefore
                            will be tantamount to grant assistance as far as the United States is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, it is recommended that the Department of State initiate
                            action requesting the President, pursuant to Section 451(a) of the
                            Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, to make the necessary
                            determination which will authorize the provision of military assistance

                        <p>On December 16 at the 429th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> brought up the
                            subject of recent Indonesian developments during his customary
                            intelligence briefing:</p>
                        <p>“Turning to Indonesia, Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> reported that
                            relations between that country and Communist China had now hit bottom
                            because of the Indonesian policy of re-settling Chinese retailers, most
                            of whom are oriented toward Communist rather than Nationalist China. The
                            dispute, which has been gathering momentum since last summer, is based
                            on an Indonesian decree banning alien retail merchants in rural areas
                            and requiring their re-settlement in towns. When such merchants cannot
                            be absorbed in towns, they are placed in what the Chinese Communists
                            call concentration camps. This decree is a part of the Indonesian
                            campaign of economic nationalism against the Dutch, the Nationalist
                            Chinese, and <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0484"/>the Communist
                            Chinese in Indonesia. The Chinese Communists have been demanding repeal
                            of the Indonesian decree, but the Indonesians have refused the Chinese
                            demand. Communist China has ordered the Chinese to resist the Indonesian
                            orders. In a protest of December 9, Communist China renewed its
                            accusation of “intolerant treatment” of the Chinese and proposed
                            implementation of the Indonesian-Communist China Nationality Treaty.
                            Indonesia rejected the Communist Chinese protest and indicated that
                            implementation of the Nationality Treaty would not affect the ban on
                            retail merchants. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is
                            said to be affronted by Chinese Communist meddling in Indonesia and has
                            issued instructions that the Chinese are to be ‘given hell.’ The
                            Communist Chinese apparently believe that this issue is a critical one
                            in the contest between Taiwan and Mainland China for the loyalty of the
                            overseas Chinese. Communist China has threatened economic retaliation
                            against Indonesia, possibly including withholding of thirty million
                            dollars in trade credits. To ensure that any Chinese exiles from
                            Indonesia will go to the mainland, Communist China has been giving great
                            publicity to the welcome given to Chinese who return there. Indonesia is
                            perplexed as to how to meet this problem.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> also reported that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had decided to continue
                            martial law in Indonesia, a decision which had put the Communist Party
                            on the spot, since the Party opposes martial law but wishes to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. The economic
                            situation in Indonesia is deteriorating due to the continued existence
                            of revolutionary forces on Sumatra. These rebels are badly armed, are
                            short of ammunition, and their financial situation is deteriorating
                            rapidly. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt that even though
                            the economic situation in Indonesia was gloomy, a political collapse was
                            unlikely, and that Indonesia was more friendly to us at present than it
                            had ever been.</p>
                        <p>“The Vice President asked whether Indonesia recognized Communist China.
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> answered in the affirmative, adding that
                            the Chinese Communist Ambassador in Indonesia had been active and
                            indiscreet in this controversy. The Vice President said that one
                            argument for non-recognition of Communist China was the effect
                            recognition would have on countries with overseas Chinese. He wondered
                            how one could appraise the effect of possible U.S. recognition on this
                            problem. He wondered whether the situation would be more or less
                            difficult for Indonesia if it had not recognized Communist China. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> felt the situation would be less
                            difficult for Indonesia if it had not recognized the Chinese Communists,
                            because then the latter would not have the same opportunity to protest
                            and intervene. For example, South Vietnam had had an anti-Chinese
                            program, but had not had the same problems as Indonesia because it had
                            not recognized Communist China. The Vice President felt that when a
                            country like Indonesia recognized Communist <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459"
                                facs="0485"/>China, the result was to orient more overseas Chinese
                            toward Communist China. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> agreed. The Vice
                            President asked whether the Nationalist Chinese were already out of
                            business in Indonesia and Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> replied in the
                            affirmative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said he
                            had recently had a letter from our Ambassador to Indonesia which
                            indicated that the time was ripe for a sharp change in the nature of
                            U.S. programs in that country. The Ambassador felt that we could now
                            engage in anti-Communist propaganda in our <gloss target="#t_USIS1"

                            As a result of its efforts to exclude Indonesia’s economically powerful
                            Chinese minority from certain areas of domestic economic life, the
                            Indonesian Government has received repeated threatening protests from
                            Communist China. Asserting that these protests constitute interference
                            in its internal affairs, Indonesia has stood its ground and gone ahead
                            with the anti-Chinese measures. Although Indonesia seems anxious to
                            maintain good relations with Communist China, the incident has already
                            served United States interests in the sense that the arrogant,

                            1958 were scheduled to expire December 17, 1959, but President <persName

                            December 16 to extend them indefinitely. He decreed continuation of the
                            so-called State of War (which has prevailed since December 1957), under
                            which he will administer what amounts to martial law throughout the
                            country. The anti-Communist Army leadership, which is heavily
                            represented in the present government, is expected to continue to play
                            the principal role in implementing martial law.</p>

                            court of Allen L. Pope, a United States citizen shot down and captured
                            in May 1958 while flying a bomber for the Indonesian rebels, began
                            December 28 in Djakarta. After the first day’s sitting it was recessed
                            until January 2. In an effort to capitalize on widespread public
                            interest in the trial and resentment against Pope, Djakarta’s Communist
                            press is trying to stimulate popular demand for the death penalty for
                            Pope. Pope’s capture in 1958 intensified then extensive Indonesian
                            suspicion that the United States Government was at least indirectly
                            encouraging the rebels. The current Communist press campaign also hints
                            at supposed United States Government involvement in Pope’s activities.
                            However, there has been no indication thus far that the prosecution will
                            make any such accusations in connection with the trial.</p>

                            to an urgent Netherlands request that the United States assist in
                            maintaining Dutch defensive forces in West New Guinea by making
                            available four C–47 aircraft which the Dutch recently have declared as
                            excess to their requirements in the Netherlands. These planes, which are
                            now physically in the Netherlands, were furnished under <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Netherlands has made strong representations for United
                            States assistance in maintaining Dutch defensive forces in West New
                            Guinea. In his letter of March 22, 1959 to Dutch Defense Minister
                                Staf,<note n="1" xml:id="d237fn1">Not found.</note> Mr. Quarles
                            stated that the United States had given the Defense Minister’s request
                            most careful attention and that he should like to assure the Dutch “of
                            our willingness to assist you where possible in the purchase of the
                            equipment you need for non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            defensive purpose.” In subsequent conversations in The Hague and in
                            Washington, officials of the Departments of State and Defense have
                            assured the Dutch that we desire to assist them by facilitating the sale
                            of United <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>States surplus or
                            excess military equipment. The Department of State would not, of course,
                            propose the transfer of United States military equipment for Dutch
                                non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> use unless purchased by
                            the Dutch.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch have stated that they wish to transfer the four C–47 aircraft
                            to West New Guinea in January, 1960. The urgency derives from the fact
                            that the crash of the fourth Mariner patrol aircraft of the single
                            squadron which the Dutch have in New Guinea has caused the indefinite
                            grounding of all these aircraft. Under these circumstances, Defense
                            Minister Visser has explained to our Ambassdor that he believes it
                            imperative that some replacement aircraft be available for service in
                            West New Guinea as soon as possible.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2"

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 756.5622/1–460)</note> While
                            the four C–47’s cannot constitute more than a temporary stopgap measure
                            pending the replacement of the obsolete Mariners by a squadron of
                            serviceable patrol aircraft, the Dutch have stated that the latest crash
                            has aroused Dutch public opinion and has created an acute political
                            situation for the Netherlands Government. According to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Young</persName> the Dutch consider that
                            their national interests in this area are in danger and that they must,
                            without delay, take remedial steps.</p>
                        <p>Department of State staff have been informally advised by your staff that
                            requirements exist elsewhere in the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            program for C–47 aircraft. I would like to know, therefore, whether the
                            Department of Defense has planned to use the excess C–47’s from the
                            Netherlands to meet these other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            requirements or whether they would be available for sale to the Dutch to
                            meet the urgent political problem outlined above. In the event that
                            present planning envisages use of these aircraft for other <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> requirements, then it would appear that
                            we are faced with a question of relative priorities as between the Dutch
                            requirement in New Guinea and other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            needs. In order that this matter can be resolved quickly, I should
                            appreciate your urgent consideration of this problem and an early reply
                            identifying the other <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> requirements
                            for these aircraft together with the views of the Department of Defense
                            as to the military implications and importance of utilizing the C–47’s
                            now declared excess by the Dutch for these other requirements as
                            compared to selling them to the Dutch for use in New Guinea.<note n="3"

                            <item>During the past year, the U.S. program of military aid to
                                Indonesia has had a salutary effect in the Indonesian Army. United
                                States and Indonesian Army personnel now mingle in an atmosphere of
                                friendship and mutual respect as opposed to the reserve and
                                suspicion which prevailed in 1958. The Army high command now appears
                                to be staunchly pro-American and firmly opposed to the Communists,
                                international as well as local. A similar, although less pronounced,
                                trend is noticeable in the Navy. In spite of generous assistance
                                from the Soviet Bloc, the orientation of the Navy appears definitely
                                to be swinging toward the United States. These trends are believed
                                to have been influenced to a considerable degree by the U.S.
                                military assistance program and by the honesty and sincerity of U.S.
                                Embassy and <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> personnel in
                                their dealings with their Indonesian counterparts.</item>

                            <item>In the Air Force, however, the program has met with little or no
                                success. During the year, offers of assistance to the Air Force have
                                included training for 100 students; one and one half million dollars
                                worth of communications equipment; technical assistance in the area
                                of search and rescue; and visits of Air Force personnel to <gloss

                                States. No part of any of these offers has been accepted to date and
                                not one letter or official communication concerning them has been
                                received by <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>.</item>

                            <item>The Indonesian Air Force is believed to be seasoned heavily with
                                Communists and the three most influential leaders, the Chief of

                                    >USAF</gloss> representative, discredited. Discussions with

                                vacillations, misinterpretations and other dilatory tactics
                                obviously designed to render progress impossible. There is no reason
                                to believe that relationships between the <gloss target="#t_USAF1"
                                    >USAF</gloss> and the Indonesian Air Force will improve as long

                                of the Embassy, has recommended that, subsequent to the recent
                                expiration of the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                                representative’s tour, his billet be left vacant until such time as
                                the Indonesian Air Force leaders indicate a desire to promote closer
                                relations with the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> or to avail
                                themselves of U.S. aid offers. It is the consensus here and in
                                Djakarta that by leaving the space vacant, Indonesian Air Force
                                leaders may be more amenable to U.S. advice and assistance, should
                                they come to fear that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. aid
                                program may become closed to them. Further, it is believed that the
                                possibilities of a rapprochement with the Indonesian Air Force will
                                be more favorable by keeping the space available than by eliminating
                                the position entirely.</item>

                        <p>Mr. Bot said that he wished to emphasize two major points. First, while
                            Dutch-Australian technical and administrative cooperation was <pb
                                n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0493"/>satisfactory, the Australians
                            would cooperate no further in political and military matters until there
                            were clear indications that the U.S. would approve. Therefore, Mr. Bot
                            continued, the best plan of action would be for the Dutch to issue a
                            clear statement of their purpose and intents in New Guinea, this
                            statement to be supported unequivocally and publicly by the U.S., the
                            U.K., and Australia. Such actions would clear the air and would put to
                            rest any possible gnawing doubts in the minds of the Dutch now in West
                            New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Second, Mr. Bot said that West New Guinea had inadequate defenses, but
                            that the Australian section was probably in even worse shape. In this
                            connection/he mentioned that while Australian New Guinea was covered by
                                <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1">ANZUS</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> guarantees, no such treaty
                            protection was presently given to Dutch New Guinea. He believed it
                            essential, therefore, that secret joint U.S.-Australian-Dutch military
                            planning be undertaken and also that the U.S. issue a secret protocol
                            guaranteeing to defend West New Guinea.</p>

                                particularly unfortunate since Dutch feelings towards U.S. currently

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> added that he was

                                >Sukarno</persName> has changed his own position not at all as
                            result of visit but acknowledged the President “has a way of expressing
                            himself, particularly in acting as host” which was likely to create a
                            wrong impression among outsiders.</p>
                        <p>Subject of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> visit was
                            raised by <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> who asked me
                            for my appraisal of it. I told him I felt it was so far a propaganda
                            victory for <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> but that I
                            recognized GOI had taken precautions to prevent <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> from undue exploitation or enhancement their own
                            position. What impact would really be, I said, would depend on future
                            implementation of Soviet credit, particularly whether this led to closer
                            involvement as result of increased trade relations, presence of
                            technicians greater dependence generally. I added that visit also seemed
                            indicate USSR reasserting its dominant position here as opposed to
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s, in effect <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> telling latter they had
                            bungled and should now stand aside.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> expressed agreement with
                            last comment, saying that visit “must have been unpleasant” for
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>On other points I made he said he doubted <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> could gain much from visit, although party undoubtedly
                            would continue to point to increased Indo-Soviet economic cooperation as
                            evidence of greatness of communism.</p>
                        <p>As for closer involvement with Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> conceded that danger of having foreign
                            technicians was always present. To speak plainly, he said, there was
                            also problem in having American technicians in Indo. Their ideas of free
                            enterprise undoubtedly made impression on youthful minds. From point of
                            view of those attempting to establish their own identity, these all were
                            outside pressures which affected the situation.</p>
                        <p>After pointing out obvious differences respective objectives USSR, I
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> whether it was true
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> did not hit it
                            off well with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. He
                            smiled and replied, “more or less.” In some ways, he added, he had found
                            himself closer to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> than
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had since the
                            Soviet Premier was more of a “businessman” who had worked his way up
                            from the bottom and was of a practical bent.</p>
                        <p>“Did <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> then contribute
                            some ideas that might make a lasting impression,” I inquired.</p>

                        <p>“I hope so,” <persName corresp="#p_DDK1">Djuanda</persName> replied. “He
                            wanted us to concentrate very hard on a few essential things and let
                            less important matters go until later. This is what I also want.”</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> suspended parliament
                            March 5, decreeing an end to its “responsibilities and labors.” This
                            action was not wholly unexpected, since it has been widely assumed that
                            the government could not allow parliament to reject the 1960 budget,
                            which parliament appeared about to do. Moreover, it has been rumored
                            since June 1959, when the 1945 constitution was reinstated, that the
                            existing parliament might be dissolved, since guided democracy frankly
                            contemplated at a minimum the dilution of the elected parliament with
                            appointive, “functional” representatives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s decree promised
                            early “renewal” of parliament. This renewal will probably consist of (1)
                            appointment by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of a
                            new parliament containing functional representatives or (2) appointment
                            of the planned People’s Consultative Congress, a kind of
                            super-parliament expected to contain ideological, functional and
                            regional representatives and envisaged as the incarnation of Indonesian
                            sovereignty. However he chooses to handle the renewal question,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is virtually
                            certain to create a “legislative” body that will see eye to eye with the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The suspension of parliament is, as noted above, a logical and not
                            unexpected step in the development of guided democracy, a philosophy <pb
                                n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0497"/>inspired in large part by a
                            desire to end the ineffectual bickering which has marked parliamentary
                            government in Indonesia. Guided democracy is openly anti-party, and even
                            before its suspension parliament had been shorn of most of its statutory
                            power (<persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> made it clear
                            he acknowledged no responsibility to parliament, only to the People’s
                            Consultative Congress). Thus, the principal effect of the March 5 decree
                            is to deprive parliament—already without significant control over
                            governmental affairs—of its opportunity to influence public opinion
                            through its debating sessions.</p>
                        <p>Although the suspension of parliament hurts all the parties, it probably
                            hurts the Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>) most of
                            all, since that party has been making the most effective use of
                            parliament as a propaganda medium. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> probably was not motivated by any desire thus to
                            curb the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, but his action will have
                            the whole-hearted support of the Army leadership in part for this
                            reason. The Army apparently supports the measure without reservation and
                            will now provide, more exclusively than ever, the power to insure
                            implementation of the government’s measures.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Implications for United States interests</hi>. Since it
                            practically completes the process of concentrating power in the
                            executive, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s decree
                            seems to take Indonesia further away from the sort of democratic system
                            we would like to see there. However, for the time being the stability of
                            the Indonesian Government—so long as that government is non-Communist—is
                            more important to us than the maintenance of traditional forms of
                            parliamentary democracy, particular so since parliamentary regimes in
                            Indonesia helped to create the near political anarchy that has been a
                            major threat to our interests.</p>

                        <p>On March 10 at the 436th meeting of the National Security Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> discussed
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent trip to
                            Asia during his intelligence briefing:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> then reported on <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent trip to Asia. He
                            said the overall response to <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s appearances did not live up to
                            expectations. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> received
                            his greatest welcome in Kabul, but it was forced and without enthusiasm.
                            His reception was only moderate in Soerabaja. Throughout the trip
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was glum and
                            irritable; and particularly in Indonesia he succeeded in irritating his
                            hosts by boasting of Soviet accomplishments, by criticizing the local
                            way of doing things and by such activities as impromptu lectures on
                            Soviet farming methods. A personality clash was quite evident in
                            Indonesia between <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>. On one occasion
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is reported by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> to have said ‘I did
                            not invite <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> here to be
                            insulted. You take over.’ <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was alleged to have told the Indonesians that
                            they were not true socialists and that the Indonesian Government needed
                            to exercise more compulsion against the people, a suggestion which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> rejected.
                            However, despite these clashes, the Indonesian leaders seemed to be
                            somewhat impressed by <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>,
                            so that his visit must be scored as a mild success. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> said that in Afghanistan the signing of
                            a cultural agreement with the USSR had been postponed six times before
                            it was finally signed. At <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName>’s departure Daud appeared uneasy and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> himself spoke only
                            of the weather, except to say to the King ‘Don’t be worried; all these
                            difficulties will be straightened out.’ The joint Soviet-Afghan
                            communiqué gives some support to Soviet propaganda. In this connection
                            Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> noted that Moscow is now claiming that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> will represent the
                            peoples of Asia at the Summit Meeting. During <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s visit to India a $375
                            million aid agreement for assistance to the Third Indian Five Year Plan
                            and to the Indian Atomic Energy Program was signed. Indonesia also
                            accepted assistance from the USSR in the amount of $250 million.
                            Apparently <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> was
                            prepared to offer Indonesia $400–$500 million in addition to the $126

                            evidence, in other words, that Communist China and the USSR were at odds
                            with each other on Asian policies. The Chinese Communist radio had been
                            silent during <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s trip,

                            with the Soviet Union because of its unused balance of aid previously
                            extended. However, when <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"

                                >Sukarno</persName> had decided he could not refuse these offers for
                            domestic political reasons. The Indonesians had tried to calculate the
                            maximum Soviet aid they could use without getting too deeply involved
                            with the Soviets and had arrived at a figure of $35 million annually.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had multiplied
                            this figure by seven and requested $250 million in aid. According to

                        <p>Throughout his fifteen years as head of the Indonesian state, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s formal
                            authority and his ostensible domination of the government have never
                            been as great as at present. Since assuming his current extraordinary
                            powers in July, 1959, however, he has demonstrated a complete lack of
                            capability to utilize them rationally toward the solution of Indonesia’s
                            burgeoning problems. To an increasing extent government is being carried
                            on by others, with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            falling back <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0500"/>into the negative
                            role of a wielder of vetoes and an obstacle to be bypassed. More and
                            more his attention is deviating from responsible administration toward
                            concentration on the comparatively sterile process of political
                            maneuver.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s reaction to the
                            frustrations of his position has been one of increasing irrationality
                            and emotional extremism, sharpened by physical deterioration. Having
                            alienated progressively larger segments of Indonesian leadership, he now
                            finds support only among the masses— whom he still controls—and among
                            the members of an unreliable palace clique. His status is menaced by a
                            growing polarization of forces around the Army and the Indonesian
                            Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>), both of whom see
                            him as an obstruction to be ultimately shelved although neither is as
                            yet in a position to offer a direct challenge. Such a challenge may
                            emerge whenever either side feels itself strong enough to act or,
                            alternately, if it feels its position is seriously jeopardized. In any
                            case, should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> lose the
                            support of the masses through a continuing inability to stem the
                            economic decline, through moral revulsion to exposure of his peccadillos
                            after a temporary topping from power (as in cases of Farouk and Peron),
                            or through other developments, his day will be over.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s growing
                            irrationality poses a problem to American interests in Indonesia, one
                            which may become more severe as he is driven by the economic crisis to
                            greater extremes of talk and action. In meeting this prospect, it is
                            essential to American policy that it be recognized that he is but one
                            factor in the Indonesian scene. He is not Indonesia, even though he
                            continues to be the most potent symbol of Indonesian nationalism. <hi

                                >Sukarno</persName>’s recent suspension of the elected
                            parliament.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> ignored the League’s
                            advice and announced the composition of the new parliament on March 27,
                            declaring that 130 seats would go to political parties, 131 seats to
                            functional groups. Since he indicated <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476"
                                facs="0502"/>that several of the member groups of the <hi

                            parliament, and since it appears that those groups will accept the
                            proffered seats, there seems little likelihood that the League will
                            prove to be a cohesive, effective political force. However, it
                            represents an encouraging if hesitant sign of anti-Communist
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            announcement, the <gloss target="#t_PNI1">PNI</gloss>, <gloss

                            will dominate the political party segment of the new parliament.
                            Preliminary reports of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s intended appointments to the parliament
                            suggest that the relative position of the extreme leftists will be
                            enhanced by comparison with the old parliament. Our Embassy reports that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> will find it
                            difficult to accept this shift without sacrificing (1) the principle of
                            opposing increased <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence and (2)
                            the budding Democratic League, which is said to have had his covert
                            endorsement.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> cares for
                            the composition of the new parliament, however, he may conclude that (1)
                            the influence of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has not been
                            dangerously increased and/or (2) a direct conflict between himself and
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, in which he
                            might well be bested at this time, would not advance the anti-Communist
                            cause. In any case, the real meaning of the new parliament’s composition
                            in terms of the existing political power balance is not clear, despite
                            an apparent gain for the leftists on paper. The armed forces will be
                            substantially represented in the parliament, and the non-Communist
                            elements therein, if acting together, would presumably enjoy a
                            comfortable majority. Finally, it is not yet clear that the parliament
                            will be other than a relatively powerless advisory body to the
                            centralized executive—in which the Army leadership still occupies a key
                            place.</p>
                        <p>The suspension and re-constitution of parliament is not an isolated
                            incident but part of the process of giving institutional forms to the
                            vague guided democracy concept. Thus, although tension has reached a
                            high point over the parliamentary change, an uneasy political atmosphere
                            has prevailed since the process of implementing guided democracy began
                            in 1959. Just as the concept of guided democracy has never been made
                            clear, the course its development would follow has not been predictable.
                            Uncertainty has engendered doubt as to their fate on the part of
                            individuals and groups, especially political parties, with a consequent
                            nervous jockeying among them for position and favor. In addition to
                            these selfish concerns over power and patronage relationships, there has
                            been—and still is—sincere worry in the minds of some that guided
                            democracy may lead to dictatorship. Others disapprove <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s evident intention to
                            develop guided democracy in keeping with the “unity in <hi rend="italic"
                                >gotong royong</hi>” principle—which he seems to interpret as
                            requiring significant <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> participation
                            in governmental affairs. Whatever misgivings about the nature and course
                            of guided democracy there may be, <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"
                                facs="0503"/>however, this unclear concept is rapidly being
                            converted into a wobbly institutional system within the framework of

                            place for some time to come.</p>

                                from military and civilian elements which are disposed openly to

                                nerve-wracking. Philosophically we may deplore the drift from

                        <p>From the point of view of our relations with Indonesia which, as you

                            particularly disturbing, especially in view of their insistence that we

                        <p>The proposed <hi rend="italic">Doorman</hi> tour would present serious
                            problems for us in our relations with Indonesia. The announcement of the
                            tour has been attacked violently in the Indonesian press and Indonesian
                            Government spokesmen have publicly condemned this projected Dutch show
                            of force in the West New Guinea area. On April 11 the Indonesian
                            Minister Counselor, under instructions of his government, raised with
                            the Department the question of the <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi>
                            cruise which he termed belligerent and provocative and detrimental to
                            the peace of the area and to Indonesian-Free World relations (Tab
                                B).<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Memorandum of conversation, April

                                Supplement.</note> The minister asked whether the United States
                            could not moderate the Dutch attitude. It seems clear that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Doorman</hi> visit could seriously undercut the
                            efforts the United States has been making to dampen Indonesian
                            chauvinism with respect to the West New Guinea issue.</p>
                        <p>The démarche of April 11 represents the third time the Indonesian Embassy
                            has approached the Department in the past two months to express serious
                            concern over what the Indonesians term a Dutch military “build-up” in
                            the West New Guinea area. On February 10 the Indonesians raised the
                            question of the sale of four Dakotas to the Dutch for use in West New
                                Guinea;<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3">A memorandum of this

                            through these Indonesian démarches were that this Dutch military
                            “build-up” could only serve to heighten tensions in the area and that
                            the United States could and should do something to deter the Dutch from
                            this course of action. The Indonesians have shown particular interest in
                            whether or not the United States had concurred in the use of any <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> equipment by the Dutch in West New
                            Guinea.</p>

                        <p>What concerns me above all about the proposed <hi rend="italic">Karel
                                Doorman</hi> tour is, of course, the Dutch intention to retain
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-furnished carrier aircraft
                            aboard the ship during the Southeast Asia visit. Whether or not it is
                            legally and technically feasible for the Dutch to do this under the
                            existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> agreements, the use of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-furnished aircraft by the Dutch in West
                            New Guinea, albeit for a limited period of time, could seriously
                            jeopardize our friendly relations with Indonesia and be generally
                            embarrassing to us in our relations with other Asian countries. If they
                            do not already know, the Indonesians will almost certainly become aware
                            of the presence of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> aircraft aboard
                            the <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> and we will be open to the
                            charge of bolstering the Dutch military posture in West New Guinea
                            through the use of United States-owned aircraft. Needless to say, such a
                            situation would be exploited thoroughly by the Communists in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that in connection with the recent Dutch procurement of
                            four United States Dakotas for use in West New Guinea, the Department
                            took the position (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>’s
                            letter of January 7, 1960 to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"

                                    >Document 237</ref>.</note> that “The Department of State would
                            not, of course, propose the transfer of United States military equipment
                            for Dutch non-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> use unless purchased
                            by the Dutch.” In that case we in fact took pains to sell the Dakotas to
                            the Dutch, after they had been declared surplus, and we were thus able
                            to inform the Indonesians that there was no question of our concurring
                            in the use of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> equipment in the West
                            New Guinea area. Despite the temporary aspect of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Doorman</hi> mission, it appears that we are faced with the same
                            basic questions—i.e., whether or not we would concur in the transfer of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> equipment for use in West New
                            Guinea by the Dutch defense forces.</p>
                        <p>Since we will have to reply shortly to this latest Indonesian démarche,
                            and since I assume that <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> is currently

                        <p>In an April 21 memorandum to Under Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, Assistant Secretary <persName

                            States provide the Indonesian Navy with an engineering survey at Ambon,
                            the principal Indonesian administrative and military base in the
                            Moluccas. The reason for <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName>’
                            recommendation was Indonesia’s acceptance during <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s recent visit of a $5
                            million credit and technical help with construction of an oceanographic
                            and marine science institute at Ambon. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1"
                                >Parsons</persName>’ memorandum noted the danger of Soviet
                            assistance acting as a precursor to Soviet aid to the Indonesian Navy.
                            The institute could provide the Soviet Union an opportunity to do
                            scientific and probably intelligence work over which the United States
                            would be unable to maintain surveillance. By helping in reconstructing
                            the modest naval base at Ambon, the United States could keep a close
                            watch on Soviet activities there and strengthen the Indonesia Navy’s
                            hand in resisting pressure for further Soviet assistance. In addition to
                            recommending the engineering survey within the 1960 fiscal year Military
                            Assistance Program, <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> also

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> opened the
                            conversation by reviewing for the Secretary the history of Dutch actions
                            in West New Guinea from the time of the 1949 Round Table Conference.
                            Emphasizing the inadequacy of the Dutch defense forces in West New
                            Guinea, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that the
                            Dutch Government had no choice but to dispatch the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Karel Doorman</hi> and to send additional military and air force
                            equipment and personnel.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, the Dutch were concerned at what Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> termed the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> lack of response and sympathy for the Dutch action. The
                            Dutch did not like but were now resigned to United States policy toward
                            Indonesia. Dutch acceptance of American military and economic support of
                            the Indonesian Government did not mean, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said, that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            could ignore the interests of its ally in New Guinea. He recalled his
                            conversation with Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> in October,
                                1958,<note n="1" xml:id="d251fn1">See <ref target="#d159">Document
                                    159</ref>.</note> and the Dutch belief at that time that
                            Indonesia planned to attack West New Guinea in March, 1959. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had assured him <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0512"/>that the last thing the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> wanted was to see the Netherlands turn
                            over West New Guinea to the Indonesians. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said that the United States had been convinced then
                            of the danger of such an attack and that Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName>’ stem talk with Indonesian Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had deterred
                            the Indonesians from taking overt action.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            continued, there was absolute evidence of an Indonesian plan to take
                            over West New Guinea by means of infiltration and subversion. The Dutch
                            had clear evidence of six recent infiltrations by small bands of
                            Indonesians, two of which had occurred in 1960. These infiltrations and
                            subversive activities, in conjunction with the lack of Dutch defense
                            forces, were undermining the morale of both the indigenous Papuans and
                            the 15,000 Dutch resident in New Guinea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> remarked that because the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had given the Dutch no military
                            guarantee for New Guinea and because the territory was not covered by
                            any regional security treaty, the Dutch had no recourse but to divert
                            national forces to meet the imminent threat of Indonesian
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he had
                            discussed the <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss> problem with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJSB1">Selwyn Lloyd</persName> and that he had
                            emphasized the Dutch concern over the British sale of 1500 parachutes to
                            Indonesia. [<hi rend="italic">2-½ lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] He noted that Foreign Minister Wigny had made a
                            full statement on the Congo. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said that he had, however, been dissuaded from
                            making such an exposition by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VHHR1">van
                                Houten</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that the Dutch
                            Government was particularly disturbed by the reaction of a Departmental
                            officer who had said that the Dutch action in reinforcing West New
                            Guinea defenses was provocative and that the Dutch were “asking for
                            trouble.” The officer reportedly had gone on to say that the Dutch were
                            over-reacting and were over-excited because of the “barking of a few
                                Indonesians.”<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">No record of this
                                conversation has been found.</note></p>
                        <p>The Dutch Foreign Minister appealed for a firmer <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> stand on the principle of the Dutch presence in West New
                            Guinea. He remarked that both the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            Australia had been firm on this point and the Dutch saw no reason why
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> could not strengthen its position
                            regarding Dutch sovereignty. He also asked that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> approach the Indonesians to set forth in
                            clear fashion the limits beyond which the Indonesians could not go and
                            to repeat Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName>’ warning against the use
                            of force.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had taken every opportunity, including
                            reiteration at the time of each arms sale, to spell out to the
                            Indonesian Government that the arms being sold them were to be used for
                            internal security and legitimate self-defense. We had also repeatedly
                            warned the <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0513"/>Indonesians against
                            the use of force. In view of the recent Indonesian propaganda regarding
                                <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>, the Secretary said that he did
                            not believe that the Dutch announcement of military reinforcements was
                            inflammatory. With respect to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName>’ report of the comments of a Departmental officer,
                            the Secretary said that these reported remarks should not be considered
                            the policy of the United States Government. The Secretary assured Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> that we would again
                            clearly state our position to the Indonesian Government and said that
                            there had been absolutely no change in our West New Guinea policy which
                            Secretary <persName>Dulles</persName> had stated to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> in late 1958.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he was very
                            gratified to receive the Secretary’s reaffirmation of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy. He asked whether he could
                            summarize the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position at the moment
                            by saying that the United States follows the situation with an open mind
                            and an awareness of the dangers of the phased plan of the Indonesians
                            for obtaining West New Guinea. The Secretary did not reply directly to
                            this question but asked the best means by which the Department could
                            obtain the latest Dutch intelligence information. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied that this could best be
                            effected through the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

                            <item>Political power in Indonesia has become increasingly polarized
                                between the Army and the Indonesian Communist Party (<gloss
                                    target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>). The economy is in a sad state and
                                popular discontent, particularly in urban areas, is increasing.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, after nearly
                                a year of complete formal power, has made no constructive move to
                                solve the country’s problems. He has taken some steps which tend to
                                weaken <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>’s position
                                and to increase the political potential of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. An increasing number of political
                                leaders, and some military leaders as well, believe that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s power must be greatly
                                reduced or eliminated if Indonesia’s economic and political decline
                                is to be halted and an eventual Communist takeover averted. (Paras.

                            <item>Since <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                                departure for a world tour on 1 April, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                    >Nasution</persName> has almost certainly been seeking to
                                organize public support and backing from military and political
                                leaders. He probably hopes to build enough strength to prevent a
                                diminution of the Army’s position and to force <persName
                                    corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to accept restrictions
                                on his monopoly of political power and a parliamentary formula which
                                would bolster the anti-Communist elements in the government. He may
                                also be attempting, in this process, to ascertain the backing he
                                would have for a move to seize power. (Paras. 21–23)</item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> may find that he
                                has created a situation, wittingly or unwittingly, in which he will
                                have to move to seize power or face dismissal. Thus the odds
                                favoring a coup attempt by <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                    >Nasution</persName> during the next two or three months have
                                probably gone up, but we believe that the chances are still less
                                than even that a coup will take place. In any event, relations

                                    <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> will probably
                                be marked by growing suspicion and tension.<note n="2"

                        <p>Embassy does not believe there is anything to gain by private statement
                            to Indonesians as to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> confidence in
                            peaceful intentions of Dutch. Most serious aspect of problem is not, of
                            course, assuaging fear within GOI that Dutch may be planning aggression.
                            Real problem is to minimize opportunity for Indonesian Communists to
                            exploit issue to their own advantage and to detriment of other major
                            political elements within Indonesia which just now are in process of
                            uniting against them for first time. Issue is creating diversion for
                            Communists just when they most need one. Foregoing does not mean that
                            fear of Dutch aggression is entirely artificial. Indonesians won
                            independence in 1950 only after <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0516"
                            />years of bloody fighting with the Dutch. Dutch are proposing to send
                            naval force to West Irian which will for time being change entire
                            balance of military power in Indonesian area. Dutch force apparently
                            superior in fire power to both Indonesian Navy, Indonesian Air Force
                            which possesses no carriers and only squadron or so of operational jets
                            which have no base near enough to do battle in eastern reaches of
                            country. Embassy’s impression is projected cruise force would in fact
                            comprise naval, air power which may well rival or surpass anything Dutch
                            could have brought to bear during fighting phase of Indonesian
                            revolution. Any <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> statement to

                            ignored at best or more likely treated as evidence of partiality to

                            United States of America in Djakarta: <list>
                                <item>“1. The Government of the Republic of Indonesia appreciates
                                    the attention given by the Government of the United States of
                                    America to the question of the dispatch of the Dutch aircraft
                                    carrier <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> and other Dutch
                                    warships, miliary equipment and combat troops to West Irian.
                                    While realizing fully the significance of the efforts of the
                                    United States in this regard, it would have been more
                                    satisfactory to the Indonesian Government, if the United States
                                    could see its way clear to attempt to seek cancellation of the
                                    projected Dutch action, inasmuch as the dispatch of
                                    above-mentioned Dutch warships and the Dutch military buildup in
                                    West Irian constitute a provocation to the Indonesian
                                    people.</item>
                                <item>“2. The Indonesian Government has reiterated time and again
                                    that the Indonesian policy in relation to the West Irian dispute
                                    is a peaceful one. This peaceful policy has been restated
                                    recently by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>
                                    in the course of his visit to Cuba when he was accompanying
                                    President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                    >Soekarno</persName>.</item>
                                <item>“3. The Indonesian Government would like to point out that
                                    expression of public opinion in the press and in resolutions
                                    adopted by various layers of the Indonesian community and
                                    demonstrations is a direct consequence of the Dutch provocative
                                    actions. In the meantime the Indonesian Government has taken all
                                    normal and also special precautionary measures with a view to
                                    controlling outbursts of excesses. The United States Government
                                    is undoubtedly aware of the fact that no disorderly
                                    demonstrations have taken place notwithstanding that an
                                    explosive situation continues to exist.</item>
                                <item>“4. The understanding of the United States Government that
                                    military equipment which is obtained by Indonesia from the
                                    United States will be used for internal security and legitimate
                                    self-defense only, and not in any attempt to resolve the West
                                    Irian dispute by force, is correct.”</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> made it clear that he

                            Surprisingly he did not mention his remarks in Cuba of which <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> then had no knowledge. In

                            and force showdown, Indonesia of course would be ready. He hoped this

                        <p>The Minister said he was glad to have this opportunity to visit
                            Washington since there were no special problems between us. He said that
                            although we may have trouble at times understanding developments in
                            Indonesia and we may wonder whether any progress is being made, he
                            thought that from the Indonesian viewpoint they continue to make gradual
                            progress. He said there had been a gradual economic decline resulting
                            from changes which have occurred and also from the actions against the
                            Dutch and Chinese but that they are prepared to accept these
                            conditions.</p>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0523"/>
                        <p>The Minister said that in the political field they have certain ideas
                            which they want to work out. There is no longer a political vacuum as
                            existed between 1950 and 1957 and they now have certain basic
                            conceptions of what is necessary for the people. He said they were aware
                            of the Communist problem and danger, but the handling of the situation
                            took a certain amount of maneuvering. The Minister said that as a result
                            of the trip and of developments in Indonesia, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is aware that this is not
                            the time to play politics. The Minister referred to the dissolution and
                            formation of Parliament as not being very significant. As to Parliament,
                            he said, “we do not attach much importance” anyway since if the
                            Parliament as appointed does not work out, the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> can always dissolve it again.
                            This procedure, however, will enable them to extend the interval before
                            the next elections, which he thought desirable. This would (1) permit
                            the development of new personalities in the parties which have been
                            dominated by the old leaders who gained prominence in the revolution,
                            and (2) give time to the non-Communist parties to organize themselves so
                            as to establish a balance between the Communists, who are the best
                            organized and financed party in Indonesia, and the non-Communist
                            parties, and (3) would also permit the creation by <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> of a national feeling in
                            Indonesia in case anything happens to him and which he believes none of
                            the old leaders can accomplish at the present time. The Minister said
                            that whether this would require more than one stage is not clear, but
                            that is the basis for the National Front. No one, he said, including the
                            armed forces, wants any outside domination and the new situation will
                            permit Indonesia to absorb and digest any foreign ideas.</p>
                        <p>The Minister referred to the actions taken by the Indonesian Government
                            against the alien Chinese and stated that he was standing firm in this
                            matter. If the problem is not solved now, he said, it probably cannot be
                            solved. He was apparently quite shaken by a statement made to him in
                            Peiping last October when the Chinese threatened to send a warship to
                            protect the Chinese in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Another problem, he said, which is not of direct U.S.-Indonesian
                            interest, is that of the relations between Indonesia and the
                            Netherlands. He said that if asked why the Indonesians are so upset by
                            the forthcoming visit of the <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi>, it is
                            not the mere sending of a ship but more the policy statement issued by
                            the Netherlands Government referring to the aggressive acts of
                            Indonesia. He said that Indonesia has given us and others repeated
                            assurances that they do not intend to use force for the settlement of
                            this problem, but that if asked now, he cannot make a public statement
                            along these lines because the Dutch have put him on the defensive. There
                            are some military groups in Indonesia that do want a showdown on the
                            West New Guinea problem, but <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> and others do not want this. He said he did not
                            know what the United States could <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498"
                                facs="0524"/>do in this situation but he thought that if the <hi
                                rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> were not sent, it would be of great
                            help not only to Indonesia but also to the general situation in the
                            area. He said that the Dutch have referred to “infiltrations” of West
                            New Guinea by Indonesians (which he did not deny), but he said that if
                            there should be an uprising in West New Guinea, it would not be the
                            result of such infiltrations but rather action by local forces. He said
                            that not only in West New Guinea but also in the other Dutch colonies
                            there are local groups who would like to see a change in the status of
                            the area. Contributing to this desire on the part of some local groups,
                            of course, is the progress which has been made in Indonesia as compared
                            to West New Guinea. The Minister said that the Government had replied to
                            our Aide-Mémoire<note n="1" xml:id="d258fn1">See <ref target="#d256"
                                    >Document 256</ref>.</note> and had restated its assurances, but
                            a public statement at this time would be impossible since it would
                            appear to have been made under U.S. pressure.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that we were very pleased with the Aide-Mémoire
                            given us by the Indonesian Government in Djakarta, which was very
                            helpful even if it could not be made public. The Acting Secretary said
                            that we had had preliminary talks with the Dutch. He did not think there
                            was much chance of cancellation by the Dutch since they had announced
                            the trip. The Dutch had made it quite clear that they had no aggressive
                            intentions and that the measure was purely defensive. Although the first
                            announcement was unfortunate, there is a chance that they will make
                            their position clear by a further statement. The general policy of the
                            Dutch is to be defensive and not to aggravate the situation, and we are
                            trying to do what we can to ameliorate the situation. The Minister asked
                            whether there was any chance of the Dutch correcting the statement. The
                            Acting Secretary said he did not think there was much chance of this,
                            but that we hoped that further statements would clarify the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he was being pressed by some quarters in Djakarta to
                            break diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. In his opinion this is
                            not desirable since among the other consequences would be action against
                            the remaining Dutch interests in Indonesia, against Shell, etc., which
                            would set in a chain reaction. He reiterated that in this case it is not
                            only that Indonesia would appreciate the assistance to Indonesia in
                            having the trip cancelled but that cancellation would be of help to the
                            situation in the area. He said that in all fairness, however, he must
                            state that preparations were under way for severing diplomatic relations
                            but he sincerely hoped this would not be necessary. Again the Minister
                            emphasized that some restatement on the part of the Dutch would be
                            helpful since it is not so much the sending of the vessels as the tenor
                            of the <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0525"/>statement made by the
                            Dutch that has been harmful. The timing of the visit is also bad,
                            especially in view of the actions which the Government was taking
                            against the Chinese and the effect this was having on the Communist
                            Party. He asked again whether from the U.S. viewpoint there would not be
                            any chance of correcting the statement. The Acting Secretary reiterated
                            that he did not think so but he hoped that further statements would be
                            helpful and would tend to play down the issue. The Minister said he also
                            hoped this would be the case and he also hoped that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> would have some influence in the
                            situation and be able to improve the climate, since he had not been
                            present at the time the statement was made.</p>

                            question.</p>
                        <p>Proposal was made after Chargé had put hypothetical questions to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> as to whether public
                            statement by Dutch giving assurance of peaceful intent, minimizing
                            quantity and quality of proposed reinforcements, and showing route from
                            Indonesian territorial waters, would be helpful in dealing with internal
                            political problem.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName>, speaking with care
                            through interpreter whom he had brought to meeting called at his
                            initiative, replied that such statement would indeed help but at this
                            juncture it would be better for Dutch to pass such assurances privately
                            to Indonesian Army (he specified that it should not be transmitted to
                            GOI through other channels). Army then could make use of information
                            internally at proper time, would let Dutch know when public statement
                            would be helpful and would let <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> know
                            when assurances could be passed officially, to GOI by <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Much depended, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> said, on way in which any
                            public statement was made as well as on timing. If these considerations
                            not fully understood, Dutch statement would be more harmful than helpful
                            by giving Communists new leverage for reviving issue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> said Communist plan had
                            been to drum up issue until <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> returned, then hand it to him as ready-made
                            means of uniting country, preventing “political confrontation” set for
                            that time. “Now,” <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> said,
                            “that has been cut off.” Asked how it had been cut off, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> replied that during recent
                            demonstrations 72 Communist leaders had been arrested. Remainder so
                            discouraged they had at least temporarily abandoned efforts to stir up
                            public. Whether they could break out with new campaign upon return of
                            President, he could not say. He reasoned, however, that public statement
                            by Dutch now would deprive Army of effective anti-Communist weapon which
                            they would have if Dutch assurances given only to them and in
                            private.</p>
                        <p>Chargé pointed out that he required to deal with GOI on official level on
                            behalf of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government; <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> was asking that <gloss

                                >Nasution</persName> directly as an intermediary with Dutch
                            Government. Was there no one in Dutch Mission with whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> could talk about such
                            arrangement? <persName corresp="#p_SBG1">Sukendro</persName> replied
                            that he would do so if it developed that it would be worth his while. He
                            expressed doubt that much could be accomplished in such manner, said he
                            would prefer <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> participation.</p>
                        <p>It was at this point Chargé asked for assurance that General <persName

                            replied in the affirmative, elaborating that authorization had been

                            In accordance with the Ambassador’s request he had asked Acting
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> to emphasize to
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> that the U.S. knows
                            that the Dutch have absolutely no desire to create an incident or force
                            a showdown over West New Guinea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRA2"
                                >Hare</persName> wanted the Ambassador to know that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> had stated that the Dutch had
                            made it quite clear they had no aggressive intentions and that their
                            actions were purely defensive (Deptel 2022 to Djakarta).<note n="3"

                        <p>After expressing his appreciation for this action, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> said that his Embassy had
                            just received the Dutch Government’s reaction to American plans to help
                            build a naval facility at Ambon. While the Dutch could not say they were
                            pleased with this development, it appeared to be an irrevocable step and
                            there seemed to be little the Dutch could do about it other than accept
                            it. The Ambassador went on to say that his Government hoped we would
                            agree to pass on to the Dutch, on a confidential basis, any information
                            we picked up at Ambon about Russian activities there as well as any
                            information bearing on the security of West New Guinea. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> agreed to this proposal and
                            instructed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CPH1">Chadbourn</persName> to see
                            that this was carried out.</p>

                                I have ever seen him, and I believe very sincerely disturbed by what
                                he described as “a serious emergency situation relating to
                                Indonesia.” He said he had every reason to believe that Indonesia
                                was preparing for attack on West New Guinea which could possibly
                                take place middle of next week. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                    >Luns</persName> said he was urging <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                    >UK</gloss>, France, Australia and <gloss target="#t_USA1"
                                    >USA</gloss> in strongest possible terms to make immediate
                                representations to Indonesian Government against any military
                                operation or threat of military operation. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> would like to see us tell
                                Indonesia in no uncertain terms exactly what we would do if
                                Indonesians launched an attack, and he was most insistent that
                                substance this conversation be relayed to Seventh Fleet. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> went on at some length
                                insisting that his intelligence sources were reliable and
                                corroborated by variety press items. As an example, he handed me a
                                Reuter’s despatch, datelined Djakarta May 26, relating to a 24-hour
                                alert for Indonesian military units on islands near West New Guinea
                                and implying that Dutch were responsible for unidentified aircraft
                                seen over these islands; also, another article with Djakarta
                                dateline May 27 emphasizing Indonesian military units brought
                                maximum state of readiness; cancellation of all officer leaves in
                                east Indonesian territory; and reports of unidentified aircraft
                                repeatedly seen over east Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                    >Luns</persName> then said that these articles and other public
                                statements should in themselves be sufficient justification for
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to make representations to
                                Indonesians against possible military action.</item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> also said that, in
                                addition to Indonesian Army units stationed on nearby islands
                                Indonesians already had some <gloss target="#t_MiG1">MiG</gloss>s,
                                bombers, landing craft, as well as quite a large number naval units
                                in area. In response to my questions, <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                    >Luns</persName> thought that military action, if it did come,
                                would be in nature of “major minor attack.” By this he meant a
                                sizeable landing of Indonesian troops with landing craft and naval
                                and air support. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> also at
                                same time emphasized weakness of present Dutch forces in New Guinea
                                area and fact that meagre forces already there necessarily had to be
                                widely deployed to maintain morale of local population.</item>

                                very specific instructions through its various channels to all
                                personnel, military and civilian, in West Guinea against doing
                                anything which could be construed as provocative in nature or even
                                interpreted as anti-Indonesia. I questioned <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> at some length why he felt
                                that Indonesia could run risk of being labelled an aggressor by
                                initiating kind of action he was worried about. Although <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> denies that unidentified
                                planes over Indonesian islands near New Guinea were Dutch, he is
                                afraid Indonesians will make this charge or a similar one a basis
                                for claiming Dutch to be the aggressor and thus provide grounds for
                                retaliation. I told <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> so
                                far as I knew, these planes were not U–2’s.<note n="4"

                        <p>The President telephoned from Gettysburg to say that he had been very
                            annoyed over the Dutch declaration,<note n="1" xml:id="d263fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d261fn1">footnote 1, Document 261</ref>.</note> and
                            wanted to discuss this with the Secretary. The President said he
                            couldn’t go to Indonesia since he is committed to be in Japan on June
                            19, but he thought we should let the Dutch Ambassador know that we are
                            very annoyed at one country <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0533"
                            />saying what the President can do in another independent country, and
                            that we don’t think this is in accordance with good diplomatic
                            conduct.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed with the President; that this was the second
                            time <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van Roijen</persName> had been out of
                            bounds—having gotten out of bounds with Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> a couple of years ago—and the Secretary
                            agreed his knuckles should be rapped.</p>
                        <p>The President said when this was reported to him by John <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> or General <persName
                                corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, they had said the
                            Ambassador was very embarrassed but had indicated he was under very
                            specific orders from his Government after a complete Cabinet meeting.
                            The President said we ought to let the Dutch Government know this is now
                            an independent country and that it is not within the bounds of decency
                            and diplomatic usage to say this will strike at the basis of friendly
                            relations between our two countries, which the President said was as
                            extreme as anything he could think of.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the reason the Dutch are so touchy is that they are
                            sending a warship to West New Guinea and also sending some
                            reinforcements Out there and the Indonesians have reacted quite
                            violently, so the Dutch are extremely touchy at the moment.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would have been one thing if the Dutch had said
                            “please, as a friend, don’t go to Indonesia,” but the President said it
                            was something else again for them to say this is striking at the very
                            basis of our friendly relations. The President said if our relations are
                            this fragile and weak, maybe we had better take a good look at the whole
                            picture.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he agreed we should make this very clear to the
                            Dutch.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had sent word to the State Department that he could
                            hot visit Indonesia, not because of the Dutch declaration but because of
                            the time element. The President said he thought the Secretary should
                            tell the Dutch that while the time element alone made it impossible for
                            the President to go to Indonesia, the President joins with the
                            Government in thinking this is in very bad taste and uncalled
                            for—something of this kind. The President said he has always admired the
                            Dutch extremely and used to enjoy visiting their country, but he was not
                            going to see them get away with saying that an incident of this kind or
                            his doing something he has a right to do strikes at the basis of our
                            friendly relations.</p>
                        <p>The President said he won’t leave here before the 11th or 12th of June
                            and there may be an extra day in Anchorage. The President said if he
                            gave two or three days in the Philippines, where he lived so long, had
                            even 24 hours in Taipei, and one day on a cruiser or somewhere as a day
                            of rest, that was all there was time for.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said we could say the President’s domestic schedule had
                            been arranged to take out this set period of time and could not be
                            changed.</p>

                            Australian Government approached by Dutch along lines <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>’ approach to you. Australian
                            official reaction is that Dutch unduly alarmed since Australian
                            intelligence like ours does not substantiate Dutch report of imminent
                            Indonesian military action. Australians reason that Indonesian actions
                            such as 24-hour alert consistent with publicly announced intention
                            reinforce east Indonesia areas and need not reflect any aggressive
                            intentions. Australians note further that similar Dutch alarm in early
                            1959 proved unfounded and that current Dutch alarm apparently arises
                            from unspecified intelligence report. Australians believe Dutch approach
                            may be effort exploit current <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>

                            Ambassador Djakarta at his discretion to question GOI regarding military
                            preparations in East Indonesia with view subtlety putting Indonesia on

                                    to New Guinea and appreciated fact that we understand Dutch
                                    concern in this matter (paragraph 6 reftel). He commented that
                                    he too regards taking matter to Security Council as last resort.
                                    He said if Dutch took problem up in Security Council they should
                                    probably do so only once and he felt case was not strong enough

                                engaging in such military adventure and would thus keep <persName

                                to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> substantiates fact that there
                                is danger of a military operation ordered by <persName

                                Government on same matter, I had some feeling that such approaches
                                could lose their effectiveness by being pushed too hard. After

                                and so often that it became meaningless. Thus, although he was

                                to Indonesian Government at this time, he still felt we should point
                                out our concern to Indonesians based on press notices of Indonesian
                                military build-up in Eastern territory, for these moves could only

                                Karel Doorman sailed, and the implication by <persName

                                    from the Dutch went beyond the Karel Doorman incident. “From

                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> referred to the
                            Ambassador’s démarche on May 26 concerning the possibility of the
                            President’s visiting Indonesia. In the first place, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said, the decision not to go
                            to Indonesia, had been made prior to the Ambassador’s talk with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName> on May 26. Because of
                            time limitations the President would not make any visits south of the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> then referred to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA2">Hare</persName>’s statement to the
                            Ambassador to the effect that the liberty of action of the President
                            could not be bound, even hypothetically. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> said that had the Dutch come to us as a friend
                            and asked us to consider their point of view, it would have been readily
                            understandable. But we do not find it possible to accept a hypothetical
                            condition being placed on the movements of the President to other
                            countries with which we maintain friendly relations. Moreover, we found
                            the Ambassador’s démarche, made under instructions, to be excessive in
                            tone and not in keeping with the maintenance of good relations between
                            our two countries. The use of phrases such as a reevaluation or
                            reorientation of Dutch policy vis-à-vis the U.S. was most disturbing to
                            us. The President’s reaction had been comparable and the effect of the
                            Ambassador’s démarche had not been a happy one.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador appeared to receive these remarks with equanimity and said
                            that he had wanted to speak in all frankness in order that we be left
                            with no doubt as to the violence of Dutch reaction should the President
                            have decided to go to Indonesia. He was afraid that Dutch sentiments in
                            this matter might be overlooked in the United States. He thought it was
                            accurate to compare Dutch reaction to a Presidential visit to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> in Indonesia to U.S.
                            reaction should Prince <persName corresp="#p_Bernhard1"
                                >Bernhard</persName> visit Cuba, thereby giving the impression that
                            the Netherlands endorses Castro’s anti-U.S. actions. The Ambassador said
                            that he had wanted to impress on us the seriousness of this matter to
                            the Dutch. He said that his government had wanted us to know that the
                            Dutch can not be taken for granted. In closing, he said that he would
                            pass on to his government the Secretary’s and the President’s reactions
                            as outlined to him by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"

                        <p>1. It is possible that Indonesia will request the inscription of the
                            Netherlands New Guinea item in the agenda of the 15th General Assembly.
                            Although there are no definite indications that the Indonesians have
                            made a decision to this effect, growing internal political pressures,
                            the increased voting strength of the anti-colonials in the GA, and the
                            reinforcement of Dutch military units in Netherlands New Guinea could
                            stimulate them to do so.</p>
                        <p>On April 21 Netherlands Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJH2">Van
                                Roijen</persName> informed me that The Hague would like the United
                            States to consider instructing our Embassies in a few key Afro-Asian
                            capitals to discourage discreetly the inscription of the New Guinea
                                item.<note n="1" xml:id="d267fn1">An April 21 memorandum of

                            about the advisability of inscription and another <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>From the United States viewpoint, inscription of the West New Guinea item
                            would be undesirable for several reasons. Debate of this issue at the
                            General Assembly would further exacerbate an already tense situation and
                            further increase the disruptive influence of this issue. Moreover, if a
                            resolution desired by the Indonesians should be adopted, the GOI might
                            consider that even an implicit GA endorsement of its claim to West New
                            Guinea afforded justification for vigorous action to oust the Dutch.
                            Another likely unfavorable consequence is that the Dutch might abandon
                            their efforts to prepare the Papuans for self-determination, and/or
                            grant them independence precipitously and prematurely.</p>
                        <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0543"/>
                        <p>It appears to be in our interest, therefore, to do what we can in a
                            reasonable and quiet way to discourage an Indonesian decision to seek
                            inscription. We believe that this objective can best be served at least
                            for the time being by instructing our Embassy in Djakarta very
                            discreetly to discourage the Indonesians from raising the New Guinea
                            question in the General Assembly again.</p>
                        <p>We are uncertain whether <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> approaches in
                            key Afro-Asian capitals would materially affect the responses of these
                            governments to any Indonesian initiative, and we prefer to defer such
                            approaches at this time. Moreover, such approaches would entail added
                            risks of misunderstanding by the Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>2. The meeting in your office was necessitated by the fact that agreement
                            on the attached instruction could not be obtained at the bureau level.
                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> opposes the sending of such
                            instructions, and is preparing its dissenting comments. This impasse is
                            symptomatic of a fundamental cleavage of opinion within the Department
                            with respect to the New Guinea issue. Inasmuch as this issue is again
                            active and may be debated at the 15th General Assembly, it is imperative
                            that a thorough re-evaluation of our policy towards the West New Guinea
                            question be undertaken on an urgent basis. This might be done by
                            S/P.</p>
                        <p>I believe it likely that a study will show that some of the basic
                            premises on which our neutral policy on the West New Guinea issue was
                            based have changed and that a complete review of our policy is therefore
                            required. It is clear, for example, that in the expanded General
                            Assembly, our previous position of neutrality can no longer insure that
                            a resolution on New Guinea will not be passed. For example, a simple
                            resolution recommending negotiations between Indonesia and the Dutch
                            would probably muster the necessary 2/3 majority. This, of course, would
                            be taken as a defeat for the Dutch. Admittedly, a major handicap in
                            determining the implications of GA action on West New Guinea is the
                            complete lack of a long-range <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy
                            decision on the ultimate disposition of that territory. This, in turn,
                            means we cannot at present devise or execute tactics that will give us
                            maximum maneuverability and influence.</p>

                            told the Dutch that we would help to the limit of our legal authority in
                            the event of Indonesian aggression, but that he could make no prior
                            commitment without Presidential approval and he doubted that the
                            President would give his approval without Congressional sanction.<note

                        <p><gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> reasoning again raises issue
                            which Embassy had believed long since settled, i.e., whether Marshal
                                <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName>’s
                            pro-Communist <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0546"/>proclivities, if
                            any, or his complete unreliability as an anti-Communist force should be
                            a major factor in determining the level or kinds of assistance to
                            Indonesian Air Force. Although Embassy recognizes other political
                            considerations involved in question of long-range bombers, for example,
                            our views of <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName>
                            should not mislead us as to the more basic reasons why aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss> can advance our interests here.</p>
                        <p>The question is not whether or not Indonesian Air Force will have
                            trainers. We do not have power to withhold trainers but only to help
                            prescribe where they must be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Therefore our decision is whether <gloss target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss>
                            is to obtain trainers from us with possible increase in pro-Western
                            orientation or from bloc with increased hostility to West as result our
                            efforts to confine aid purely to those items which we think best.</p>
                        <p>Even more important consideration, however, is need to counter Communist
                            charges that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> working with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> against President, other
                            elements of GOI who desire neutral course. At this time when President
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is in mood of
                            deep distrust toward us it even more important than ever we avoid
                            appearance of internal political meddling by favoring one or two
                            services to exclusion of another. If <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1"
                                >Suryadarma</persName> gains stature because of this policy, Embassy
                            regards such development as unfortunate by-product but not of sufficient
                            importance to justify change in policy. Certainly Marshal <persName
                                corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName>’s prestige will rise
                            just as high if he obtains his trainers from Soviet bloc as if he
                            obtained them from us. It is true that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> considers <gloss target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss>
                            military counter-weight to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>, but again, bloc trainers in <persName
                                corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName>’s hands likely to
                            accentuate this capacity to a greater degree than if trainers, technical
                            back-stopping come from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On other hand, so long as we can answer <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> by pointing out we are not discriminating
                            between the various forces at his disposal, we reduce danger of
                            Communist-backed <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> move
                            against <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>.</p>
                        <p>While it might be contended we should give Air Force something less
                            useful to it than training aircraft, we cannot long hope to maintain any
                            sort of relationship with <gloss target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss> if we
                            insist on right to determine what is good for it. In any case, almost
                            any substitute items would add just as much to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName> strength and prestige
                            as would trainers.</p>
                        <p>Embassy extremely reluctant seek General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>’s views on this sensitive subject at this time.
                            Although we are close to <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> in many ways neither he nor we have ever put
                            cards on table to extent of permitting him to have voice in determining
                            kind of material furnished Air Force. This would presuppose
                            understanding between us which had best remain unspoken for now.
                            Further, even though <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> as
                            Minister of Defense theoretically controls <persName
                                corresp="#p_Suryadarma1">Suryadarma</persName>, all concerned are
                            perfectly <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0547"/>aware this not in
                            fact true relationship. Should <persName corresp="#p_Suryadarma1"
                                >Suryadarma</persName> or President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> learn we had discussed question with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, harm to <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests would be incalculable.</p>
                        <p>Therefore Embassy considers <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should make
                            own unaided judgment as to whether trainer planes of type and quantity
                            desired would significantly add to capability of Air Force to resist
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> and how much weight
                            this consideration should be given.</p>
                        <p>Embassy for its part has great difficulty in understanding how training
                            planes could possibly effect power balance should <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> decide to move against
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that arguments advanced against trainers would inveigh
                            against any assistance at all.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARMA1"
                                >ARMA</gloss> concur this estimate. Although AIRA temporarily absent
                            from Djakarta, Chargé believes foregoing reflects his views also.</p>
                        <p>Embassy will comment other aspects Deptel 2258 after final confirmation
                            of instructions.</p>
                        <p>In that connection meanwhile, however, one effective means of helping

                            able to convince the President that his suspicions were unjustified. I
                            replied frankly that I did not know; but that President was most cordial
                            throughout and appeared to accept points I had made. I went over same
                            ground then reviewed our support program with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and asked him how President
                            could think we were gunning for him when we were supporting his
                            government to this extent. I emphasized situation was quite different
                            today from that prior to adoption 1945 Constitution in that this <pb

                            again denied that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had been consulted
                            in connection with Karel Doorman plans and said I was certain that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName>’s own consultations
                            in Washington must have led him to conviction this was true. As for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>’s statement,
                            Foreign Minister who had seen full text must realize this was slip of
                            tongue which occasionally happens to all of us and did not represent
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intention to establish base in
                            West New Guinea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> in agreeing said he
                            hoped that I would make these same points when I next saw <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I asked what <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> thought
                            President had in mind in wanting to have serious talk prior to August
                            17. Foreign Minister laughed, said presumably <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> wanted to warn me of all
                            the terrible things he might say in his independence day speech. Turning
                            serious, he said he did not know but that it could be on the subject of
                            West Irian. Pressures were beginning to mount and <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> might well have something
                            new to say on this subject. The movement of <hi rend="italic">Karel
                                Doorman</hi> to West New Guinea had aroused flare of Indonesian
                            nationalism and demands for action were well-nigh irresistible. What
                            action would be taken he could not say as no decisions had been
                            made.</p>

                            accompany movement against an international corporation which is 23

                        <p>I said I could not conceive that GOI would be so lacking in appreciation
                            of its own interests as to take such action but I recognized strong
                            national tide running.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> denied firmly any

                            but he admitted there was group within Cabinet which wanted to move
                            against Shell because of its Dutch ownership. He indicated move, if it
                            were made, would probably be against Dutch shareholders in Shell, thus
                            confirming possibility reported by <persName corresp="#p_DDK1"
                                >Djuanda</persName> to me eight months ago.</p>
                        <p>If objective were to attack Dutch portion of Shell interests, how did GOI
                            plan to accomplish this? I queried, pointing out practicable and legal
                            obstacles to action against a group of shareholders within an
                            international corporation, situs of which was outside Indonesia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> admitted this was
                            problem which had not been solved and that final decision as to what
                            would be done and how it would be done had yet to be made. He could not,
                            however, discount possibility entirely that some step would be taken
                            against mixed enterprises which contained Dutch capital; there would be
                            no action whatever, he emphasized, against foreign investment

                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador Moekarto said that he had been here seven years as Ambassador
                            and two years as Indonesia’s representative to the United Nations. He
                            said he greatly enjoyed his stay and had learned much which would be of
                            benefit to him in his later service to his country. He and his family
                            were most grateful for the hospitality and courtesy they had everywhere
                            received. The President expressed his gratification and asked if the
                            Ambassador’s successor had arrived. Mr. Moekarto replied that he was
                            today requesting agrément for Madame Supeni who for ten years has been
                            Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Indonesian
                            Parliament. He said that she is an outstanding and able woman. He added
                            that also in his country women had equal status with men and as a matter
                            of fact there were perhaps greater numbers of women in Parliament and in
                            public life there than here. The President referred to the several women
                            he had sent as Ambassadors during his Administration and said that he
                            would particularly like to meet Madame Supeni. He specifically requested
                            that when she came the State Department arrange for him to set aside
                            more than the usual time for her initial call.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Moekarto said that he wanted to bring up particularly the
                            subject of the length of time students from Indonesia could stay in this
                            country. At independence his country was left without trained people in
                            all fields and it was so to speak “technically underdeveloped.”
                            Indonesia had benefited from and was grateful for United States
                            technical assistance in the amount of about ten million dollars a year
                            and many hundreds had come to this country to learn. He wished, however,
                            that they could stay long enough to come to understand our institutions
                            and <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0552"/>our way of life so they
                            could contribute more usefully in the future. Mr.
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> before his death had written him
                            expressing enthusiasm for the thought of finding some way for students
                            to stay for not six months to a year but for a longer term, say four to
                            six years. The Ambassador realized that there were difficulties for us
                            but hoped that some way could be found to make longer stays possible. He
                            thought it would be a good “intellectual investment” for the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>After asking how many students come here each year, the President said
                            that he could see some justification for varying the length of stay of
                            people in different categories. For instance, those who were learning a
                            profession needed to stay a longer time, whereas an agricultural expert
                            who in fact lived with people interested in agriculture during his
                            training could learn about this country and its ways more quickly. He
                            said he agreed with what the Ambassador had said as to the value of a
                            longer stay for students in the United States and he hoped that
                            something could be done.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then raised the West Irian question which he described as
                            a delicate political issue. The recent Dutch action in sending the
                            carrier <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> to West Irian had greatly
                            aroused Indonesian concern and it was feared that some action by the <hi
                                rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> might set off a conflagration.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d272fn1">During his independence day speech on August
                                17 President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the
                                Netherlands. He stated that this step was being taken in response to
                                the dispatch of the <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> to West New
                                Guinea. In telegram 439 from Djakarta, August 17, the Embassy
                                informed the Department of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                    >Sukarno</persName>’s action, indicating that aside from the
                                remarks concerning the breaking of relations with the Netherlands
                                the speech did not depart very much from the draft text that the
                                Department had already received. There was no mention in the speech
                                of the nationalization of Shell, as earlier speculated, or any other
                                specific moves against Netherlands interests. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 656.98/8–1760) See Supplement.</note> The Ambassador
                            briefly described the Indonesian case on West Irian and mentioned that
                            the matter had been taken up in the United Nations but Indonesia had not
                            secured a two-thirds majority. He hoped that the United States could
                            help in preventing a clash and in securing a favorable resolution of
                            this issue on which his people felt most strongly.</p>
                        <p>The President said that while he had not been to West Irian he had been
                            to other outlying and undeveloped areas in the Far East and he found it
                            difficult to understand why the feeling which had arisen over West Irian
                            was so strong. He did not know why the area was important although he
                            understood there was bauxite there and, the Ambassador added, oil. The
                            President had talked to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YP1"
                                >Young</persName> who had told him that Dutch feeling on the issue
                            was almost incandescent.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">No record of this
                                conversation has been found.</note> Perhaps the Dutch had the
                            feeling of being kicked out with the help of others <pb n="527"
                                xml:id="pg_527" facs="0553"/>and perhaps they regarded this issue as
                            symbolic as though, so to speak, it kept the Dutch flag flying and added
                            to their prestige a little. He would however talk to the State
                            Department, to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            in fact, and get the best possible briefing to see if there was anything
                            we could do.<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">See <ref target="#d276"
                                    >Document 276</ref>.</note> He thought, however, that in this
                            situation it was hard to be “a friend of the court” and be caught in the
                            middle.</p>
                        <p>In taking his leave the Ambassador expressed his good wishes to the
                            President for the future. The President in replying particularly asked
                            that the Ambassador give his warm regards to President <persName

                        <p>The dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia over West New Guinea
                            began in 1946 during the inconclusive negotiations which preceded the
                            first major outbreak of hostilities between Holland and its rebellious
                            colony. At that time the Dutch, over Indonesian protest, excluded the
                            Residency of New Guinea from the discussions, and when the Dutch and
                            Indonesians sat down at The Hague in 1949 to conclude an agreement
                            granting Indonesia its independence, sovereignty over the area emerged
                            as one of the principal points of difference.</p>
                        <p>To avoid a breakdown of negotiations, both parties agreed to a
                            temporizing treaty provision which noted that the two powers had been
                            unable to reconcile their views on the status of New Guinea and provided
                            that the status quo, i.e., Netherlands control, should be maintained
                            until the differences were resolved, and stipulated that within a year
                            from the signing of the treaty the “political status” of Western New
                            Guinea should be decided by negotiation.</p>
                        <p>During the negotiations which took place in 1950 and 1951, it became
                            apparent that these views could not be reconciled and early in 1952, by
                            a constitutional amendment, the Netherlands Government designated West
                            New Guinea as a part of the Netherlands Realm, and from that time took
                            the position that Dutch sovereignty over the area was no longer subject
                            to negotiation. The Indonesian Government has refused to accept this
                            action and has attempted unsuccessfully, both by direct approaches and
                            through resolutions in the General Assembly in the United Nations, to
                            persuade the Netherlands to re-open the subject.</p>
                        <p>The problem has become an emotion-charged issue both in the Netherlands
                            and in Indonesia. Both governments have taken positions from which they
                            cannot retreat without severe loss of prestige. In Indonesia <pb n="534"

                            a national crusade and has been intensively exploited by extremist
                            elements especially the powerful Communist Party seeking to worsen
                            relations between Indonesia and the Free World.</p>
                        <p>A variety of arguments are brought forth by each side. The Dutch maintain
                            that they have a moral responsibility to civilize the stone-age Papuan
                            tribes and to give them at some time the right of self determination.
                            They hold that there are no ties, ethnic, cultural or religious between
                            the Malay Javanese and the Melanesian Papuan, and that to turn over New
                            Guinea to Indonesia would only be substituting one form of colonialism
                            for another.</p>
                        <p>The Indonesians maintain that they are the legitimate heirs of the entire
                            area of the former Dutch East Indies, and that the Netherlands is
                            clinging to a portion of its former Far Eastern empire for out-moded
                            colonialist motives. They point out that many ethnic groups are
                            represented in Indonesia, that there is a strong Melanesian strain in
                            Indonesians from the eastern islands, and that the Papuans have
                            unquestionably more in common with them than they have with the
                            Dutch.</p>
                        <p>The Australians, while earnestly striving to maintain close and friendly
                            relations with the Indonesians, have strongly supported the Dutch
                            position since they feel that a West New Guinea in Asian hands would
                            threaten the military security of their country. The Japanese invasion
                            of New Guinea during World War II is still fresh in Australian
                            minds.</p>
                        <p>West New Guinea itself would appear hardly worth the bitter emotions
                            raised on its account. While extensive in area, it is made up of dense
                            jungle, snow-capped mountains, and impenetrable mangrove swamps. Except
                            for petroleum in minor quantities, raw materials in exploitable
                            quantities have not been found. The colony is an economic liability to
                            the Mother country and is likely to continue so for the indefinite
                            future. The approximately 700,000 natives of the area are among the most
                            primitive on the face of the earth, less than half having been brought
                            under nominal Dutch jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>From the outset, the United States has maintained an impartial position
                            in this dispute between two countries with which we have friendly
                            relations. The United States is, however, opposed to any resort to the
                            use of force to settle the West New Guinea issue and has recently
                            reiterated this view to both parties. Indonesia as well as the
                            Netherlands has pledged not to use force. The United States position on
                            this question is set forth within the current statement of United States

                            event in both internal and external scene here. President obviously
                            jolted by recent Army challenge to authority, running scared. As result,
                            is pulling out all stops to focus nationwide Communist-Moslem unity,
                            muffle Army-<gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> confrontation, divert
                            populace from ever-increasing woes, recreate image national and world
                            leader, and not least flatter own ego. Obviously views trip as
                            combination happy climax to less happy developments past six months,
                            panacea for national ills and personal frustrations. May even see his
                            future closely tied to it. There is, of course, unreality in all this,
                            but is very real to him.</p>
                        <p>As Department aware, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            has moved away from <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in past six
                            months, harbors fixation based on what he considers ample evidence that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> out to get him. This, carefully
                            nurtured by <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> propaganda and
                            large-scale and effective Soviet blandishments, has been further
                            reinforced by obvious fact his chief internal foes clearly lean towards
                            West. If this fixation confirmed by cold shoulder in <gloss

                            visit (and his definition cold shoulder will be particularly sensitive
                            in present frame of mind), we may well face his open hostility for long
                            time to come.</p>
                        <p>There might conceivably be advantages to cold shoulder treatment if we
                            conclude time has arrived write off <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>. Little doubt that his star has declined in past
                            year; his unending intrigues have kept country in state constant
                            turmoil, have been major factor in preventing progress toward reasonable
                            politico-economic posture; his guided democracy increasingly shaping up
                            as open totalitarian system. These facts recognized by growing number
                            other leaders who, if not yet ready abandon him, are at least deeply
                            disturbed.</p>
                        <p>This particularly significant in case of Army, which Embassy continues
                            believe is only force now in sight with capabilities reversing present
                            deterioration. Recent events—Army drive against <gloss target="#t_PKI1"

                            respect, but Army still long way from mastery situation. Army has moved
                            hesitantly in past, as conference compromise shows, still cannot be
                            fully counted on move resolutely against <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> unless direct conflict over <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> develops.</p>
                        <p>In this extremely delicate contest, conceivable that expression <gloss

                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would tip balance/bring
                            about <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>–Sukarno conflict,
                            provide final push to dislodge President or neutralize him.</p>
                        <p>Element of risk, however, is very great. Should move fail bring prompt
                            results, should <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            subsequently remain in power for even relatively short time, he might
                            well lash out in fear and anger and succeed in pulling country so far
                            toward Soviet bloc that it would be impossible retrieve short of
                            military means. Concurrently, he might erect impenetrable barrier
                            against further cooperation from West, either deliberately or in rage,
                            by seizure foreign oil companies, estates, et cetera. His attempts
                            implement these possible moves might themselves trigger Army reaction,
                            thereto realizing postulated goal. On other hand, Army would be at
                            severe disadvantage in any dispute involving apparent defense foreign
                            interests, particularly with spellbinder <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> in opposition. (Viz., Army passivity when
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> brought country

                        <p>On balance, risk involved in foregoing course seems too extreme, chances
                            of success too slim and adverse impact of failure disastrous. By
                            entirely cutting off <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, pinning all hopes on Army,

                        <p>Alternative course, that of giving <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> welcome in Washington, also raises possible
                            disadvantages. As long as President follows present policies, it clearly

                            this sense, special treatment might give appearance of endorsement

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then brought up the
                            subject of West New Guinea. He emphasized that the Netherlands had
                            always been ready to accept a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            trusteeship for West New Guinea under which the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> could supervise the sincerity of the Dutch in carrying
                            out their pledge to prepare the territory for self determination.
                            Speaking of Dutch-Indonesian relations, he said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> now had nothing left with
                            which to hit the Dutch—the round table agreements had been repudiated,
                            all Dutch property had been seized, Dutch citizens had been thrown out,
                            no Dutch planes or ships were allowed to touch Indonesia, there are no
                            diplomatic relations. He wanted to stress, and he had stressed in his
                            talk with Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJG1"

                                Supplement.</note> that despite some difference between us on the
                            evaluation of intelligence, there still remained a real danger of
                            Indonesian aggression. It was not inconceivable, for example, that the
                            Indonesians could fake an attack and attribute it to the Dutch, allege
                            that there was an uprising in West New Guinea and claim that Indonesia
                            was going to aid this uprising, possibly with “volunteers.” The question
                            was—what would we do then in the event of direct or indirect aggression.
                            Going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was not a policy but
                            rather a long procedure. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should
                            decide concretely what it would do in such a case. In reply to a <pb
                                n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"/>question from the Secretary,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he was going
                            to stay in New York until after <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s arrival and speech in the general debate and
                            that he would speak after that before returning to The Hague.
                            Continuing, he said that he had talked with the Secretary General of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who believes that it would be
                            impossible to get any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action in
                            advance of actual aggression since the Dutch would not be able to prove
                            a military danger. The Secretary General had also agreed that if the
                            Dutch should come to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer, there was a possibility that
                            some of the Afro-Asian nations would bring up proposals which would
                            result in an invitation to the Dutch to get out. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then raised the question as to
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would be
                            seeing President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and
                            suggested that in that event the President could perhaps say something
                            in the nature of a warning.</p>
                        <p>In reply the Secretary said that the President had decided to see Chiefs
                            of State and Heads of Government in New York but to receive no Foreign
                            Ministers. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> then referred
                            to the President’s reception of Lord Home,<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2"
                                >British Foreign Secretary.</note> which the Secretary explained as
                            being due to the fact that Lord Home was new and that the British had
                            particularly desired that he have a chance to meet the President without
                            engaging in substantive discussion.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the New Guinea question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> acknowledged the U.S. political deterrent had so
                            far been effective but stressed that he was raising the question of a
                            military decision. Obviously, the Netherlands was not going to fight a
                            Pacific war alone. It was clear that the Indonesians now had sufficient
                            troops, matériel and transport to enable them to move in on West New
                            Guinea overnight and be established there the next day as a fait
                            d’accompli. He said that when the Netherlands had announced that they
                            were sending one battalion to reinforce West New Guinea, <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had raged to. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> that the Dutch must have got
                            hold of Indonesian plans, probably through the Indonesian Foreign
                            Ministry. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> had denied
                            this possibility, saying that the Ministry’s only copy was in his own
                            safe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> said that he had
                            talked about this question with <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1"
                                >Gates</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3"><persName

                                concerning primarily <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and
                                defense matters. At the conclusion of the meeting Luns “stated that
                                he had one more personal request. He said that the Dutch had some
                                feeling that the Indonesians might attack Dutch New Guinea. He asked
                                that the Secretary personally look into the matter. He thought that
                                the U.S. should reaffirm to Indonesia its general opposition to the
                                use of force to solve issues between nations and its specific
                                opposition to the use of force by Indonesia against New Guinea.
                                There was an inference that if Indonesia attacked New Guinea, the
                                U.S. should assist the Netherlands at least logistically.”

                            decision and action to get the Indonesians to lay off any aggression. In
                            this <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0568"/>connection, he reiterated
                            that the Netherlands would be prepared to accept a representative of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General or anything of
                            the kind.</p>
                        <p>There ensued some discussion as to the date of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s arrival in New York. The
                            Secretary had thought he would arrive on October 7 but the Dutch thought
                            Monday, September 26 (later inquiry at the Department indicated an
                            arrival date of September 28). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> then reiterated that his Government thought it
                            important that he see the President briefly. Amb. <persName

                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> in this connection, citing the
                            importance of the Dutch role in connection with the DeGaulle

                            and the fact that under the Dutch governmental system the Foreign

                            to see the President very privately and the matter would be kept
                            entirely secret as it had on a similar call a few years ago. The

                        <p>From my talks with him, I am convinced that <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>’s objective is to steer <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> into anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> position but that he has no present
                            intention of getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>, believing latter’s political leadership still
                            important to nation. In other words, <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> believes he can convert or if he can not
                            convert he can control <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>. Thus answer to first question will be vital to
                            him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is realist, however, and
                            knows that point may be reached when break between himself and <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> will develop. He is
                            marshalling his forces, hoping his obvious strength will lead <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to avoid open conflict. But
                            he must prepare for possibility of break and consequently must have an
                            answer to question number two.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> is not only fighting our
                            battle within Indo; he is fighting internal foe who has tremendous
                            external resources. Soviets have let it be known that $250 million aid
                            is by no means upper limit of what they are prepared to do in economic
                            development, and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                >AURI</gloss> in his pocket, illustrates that in military area,
                            Soviets are willing to bid high price to neutralize influence <gloss

                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has been steering nation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has got to know
                            something about resources he may be able to count on.</p>
                        <p>Problem of course is to provide <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> kind of assurances he needs without either (A)
                            putting him on spot of apparently being disloyal his President or (B)
                            forcing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> into Soviet
                            camp should he hear, as he probably would hear, of assurances given

                        <p>To avoid above pitfalls, we could, I believe, inform <persName

                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is prepared to provide substantial
                            increase in military and economic support to an Indonesian government
                            which would adopt a sound program for establishment of political and
                            economic stability in country. Sound program might be defined to
                            include: (A) continuing curb on power <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>; (B) adoption financial economic stabilization program;

                        <p>We could further inform <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            without soliciting reply that should army as a result of all-out

                            economic support by <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government. No
                            reference should be made to <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that important question any commitment new <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> aid would be estimate foreign policy
                            orientation new regime, although I do not think this should be
                            determining. While not impossible, I believe we cannot expect
                            army-dominated regime adopt pro-west alignment, at least in short run,
                            because of strong nationalist feelings, sensitivity toward colonialism
                            and imperialism which will continue be nurtured by West New Guinea
                            problem. Army controlled regime would probably be to right of <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on foreign policy but
                            adhere to “independent” line. Crucial difference, however, would be
                            removal <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> influence, which may be
                            expected to result in increased wariness, if not actual coolness, toward
                            Soviet bloc. However, Soviet bloc may still find room for maneuver this
                            situation which my opinion underscores necessity <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> making clear its intention support <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> on basis of mutual
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>If we make démarche along above lines, I consider it of utmost importance
                            for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to be received at
                            White House. For <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> to be
                            given red carpet treatment at Cabinet level while <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is overlooked would light
                            fires of resentment in breast Indonesian President which would
                            unquestionably start him on road undermining <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>. Further, if word as to
                            assurances given <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            reached <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s ears, his
                            suspicions that this was directed against himself would appear far less
                            well-founded if he already had received royal welcome.</p>
                        <p>In the skirmish of September 12, army program was slowed down, yet it
                            seems clear that real power is more and more coming into <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>’s hands. At this stage, I
                            think it vital that he be given strong assurances of support without
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> removal from
                            scene being made condition precedent. In nutshell any <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> tactic at this point should be to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> without
                            antagonizing <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>.</p>

                        <p>Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Abdul Haris Nasution</persName>, will be in
                            Washington September 28 and 29 and will see the Secretary of Defense and
                            others in the Defense Department. We have requested an appointment for
                            him with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>. As
                            you are aware, the Army is the strongest element in Indonesia opposed to
                            the growth of Communist influence in the country. Army leaders have
                            recently banned Communist activities in certain areas of Indonesia and
                            have forced <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to agree
                            to placing a ban on all political activity until November 30. It is
                            possible that this situation may result in a final confrontation between
                            the Army and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on the
                            Communist issue sometime during the coming months. Until now <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> has followed a moderate
                            course despite some pressure within the Army to take drastic action. We
                            believe that before <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>
                            would act, he would want assurances from us that we would support him if
                            he found himself in need of military or economic aid in a struggle to
                            reduce the influence of the Communists in Indonesia and eliminate
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> as an effective
                            force in the country.</p>
                        <p>I request that I be authorized to give the necessary assurances to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> along with the
                            following line: I would inform General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> that we are aware of and heartened by recent
                            actions which the Army has taken to curb Communist power. We are also
                            aware of the fact that this is an internal Indonesian matter. We are
                            heartened because we profoundly believe that Communist efforts to gain
                            power in all countries are incompatible to the true independence of
                            those countries. In contrast to the Communists, it is American policy in
                            Indonesia and elsewhere to desire the true independence of the country.
                            We know from our experience elsewhere that sometimes when there is
                            strong opposition to a strong Communist party in a given country there
                            can be a showdown. In such circumstances if there is a crisis and those
                            who oppose the Communists and who work for the true independence of the
                            country <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0572"/>want to know where the
                            United States stands, they can be sure that the United States stands
                            with them. If American help is wanted in the form of military or
                            economic assistance, the United States in such circumstances does its
                            best to be helpful and quickly. It is not possible to foresee in advance
                            what type of aid might be needed or could be provided. In any event, we
                            would like General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> to
                            feel that the United States would wish to be helpful to Indonesia too in
                            such circumstances, and if there should be a request for help of the
                            kind we have already provided, such as small arms and vehicles, or rice
                            to meet a food emergency, he could be sure we would do our best to meet
                            his request.</p>
                        <p>I would further tell General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> that we are not asking for any comment from him
                            but merely wish to assure him that in the event of such a contingency we
                            will back him up; but that if he does have any suggestions, we will take
                            them into consideration in our planning for such a contingency.</p>

                            actions curb communist activities in outlying parts of Indonesia. We
                            were aware also that this was internal matter. We were heartened because
                            of our belief that communist activities not compatible with true
                            independence or nationalism although they sought to use nationalism in
                            their drive for world domination under control of Moscow. In contrast
                            American policy has always sought to support independence of free world
                            countries including Indonesia because we believed that a world of free
                            nations organized each according to their own national genius was in
                            best long-term interests of United States. Moreover we support not only
                            political but economic independence for newly developing countries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> continued that if strong
                            opposition to a strong communist party, a situation which he thought
                            existed in Indonesia, should at some time give rise to a crisis and a
                            confrontation it might be that anti-communists would wish to know where
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> stood. He wished to say after
                            consulting various superiors in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Government that if such situation occurred in Indonesia General
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> could be sure that
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would wish to support those who
                            oppose communists. If <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was asked to
                            help in such situation <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would do its
                            best to help quickly and effectively and would try to meet any
                            reasonable request. It should be remembered that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> was not like communist countries which could pledge
                            their aid without even thinking of their own people because <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had to persuade its people that their
                            money should be used to assist foreign countries. Nevertheless if
                            confrontation occurred and new situation resulted General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> could be assured that we
                            would feel strongly that we should help him if requested. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> added that he did not ask
                            General <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0574"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> to comment on foregoing
                            statement as he merely wished him to know that this was our attitude. He
                            added that if the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was giving aid to a
                            government which was striving for political and economic stability and
                            was taking steps to curb <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> to settle
                            rebellion and to introduce appropriate financial economic development
                            measures it would be that much easier for this government to work
                            vigorously to meet Indonesian needs.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> also said that he
                            understood that there had been statements made although not at top level
                            in Indonesian Government which suggested that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> did not wish true independence for Indonesia because it
                            feared that Indonesia would then adversely influence <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> countries and might stifle <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic interests in Indonesia. He said
                            nothing could be further from truth and that far from fearing strong
                            Indonesia we desired this. Americans like most non-communist peoples
                            desired to concentrate on their own affairs and live at peace and sooner
                            other countries obtained full independence sooner burden American aid
                            programs could be reduced. If Indonesia became stronger under guidance
                            of those who concerned to prevent communist domination of Indonesia he
                            was certain Indonesian influence with other countries including <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allies would not be harmful. It
                            should be noted this connection that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            fully respected Indonesian neutrality policy as it also respected
                            neutrality policy of Burma and Cambodia. As for American enterprise
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> felt that continuance
                            American enterprise must be justified on grounds benefits to Indonesian
                            economy too and he felt that if they were allowed to operate under
                            reasonable arrangements in Indonesia benefits to Indonesian economy
                            would be obvious and would be recognized. If American enterprises on the
                            other hand were bad for Indonesia, which he did not believe, and
                            Indonesians decided they did not want them then in that case they would
                            simply have to withdraw. Point was however that contrary to what he
                            understood had been said in Indonesia recently <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> was not interested in a weaker Indonesia for any narrow
                            purpose of its own but rather desired strong and truly independent
                            Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>In reply General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> gave
                            lengthy exposition of manner in which Army was working quietly in all
                            regions and in all functional groups as well as in political front to
                            obtain practical control so as to thwart communists. Only place they had
                            real roots was central eastern Java where decade ago Defense Minister
                            who was communist had trained cadres down to village level. He said to
                            understand Indonesian situation correctly it must be realized that
                            frontal clash not likely and not wanted. On contrary process he
                            described would continue. He also showed his pleasure at obvious
                            indications of confidence in and support for him and Army. <persName

                            instead of being man of action was man whom all parties and groups

                                conversation, Parsons also discussed the West New Guinea dispute

                                that a resort to violence would weaken both parties and expressed
                                the hope that none would be used. Parsons also informed <persName

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> said he was
                            having a busy, useful visit to the United States. Several years ago our
                            relations had not been quite as understanding but now they were much
                            better and particularly with the military including <gloss

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> yesterday and said
                            that he thought our understanding of each other’s situation was good. He
                            appreciated what had been said to him in that talk which had continued
                            so long that he was almost late for the reception at the Indonesian
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the Indonesian contingent proceeding to the
                            Congo (this subject is covered by telegram sent to Djakarta and
                                Leopoldville).<note n="1" xml:id="d283fn1">Reference is to telegram

                        <p>The Secretary asked about this year’s harvest in Indonesia and was told
                            that the figures indicated a somewhat better crop. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> hoped that the goal of
                            self-sufficiency could be reached in a few years but in this field too
                            Indonesia was hampered by a lack of transport. Surplus areas had a hard
                            time, not being adequately served so that their produce could be
                            transported. He mentioned at some length the lack of communications and
                            transport which also hampered the Army in its efforts to carry out
                            security missions which were sometimes delayed as much as four months or
                            more. In this context he said that the rebels operating against the
                            Government had been reduced from over 100,000 to about 20,000 and he
                            hoped that the situation can be cleaned up, at the end of which it would
                            be necessary to terminate the war emergency powers. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName> expressed appreciation for
                            our military aid program and for the responsiveness of <gloss

                        <p>At the opening of the conversation and again at the close the Secretary
                            expressed his pleasure that General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName> and his colleagues had been able to come here
                            and his own pleasure at being able to meet the General. He paid him a
                            warm compliment on his successful conduct of his difficult position as
                            top military commander in Indonesia.<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2">During

                        <p>The Secretary called on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> at 9:30 this morning. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> opened the conversation by
                            requesting a better understanding of Indonesia by the United States.
                            When the Secretary told the President that he felt we were more
                            sympathetic and understanding than the President realized, <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> immediately turned to the
                            question of West New Guinea saying that we could best demonstrate our
                            friendship for Indonesia by coming out directly on the Indonesian side
                            in their dispute with the Netherlands. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> said he consistently told the Indonesian people
                            that Indonesia was very friendly toward the United States, but that they
                            could not understand our position on this issue. The Secretary asked why
                            Indonesia did not take the matter to the International Court of Justice
                            and <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> replied that
                            there was no question that West New Guinea was a part of the Netherlands
                            Indies and that there was nothing to be adjudicated. He said that this
                            was a matter of principle. The Secretary then pointed out that while we
                            did not support Indonesia, neither do we support the Netherlands and
                            that we were maintaining our policy of impartiality. He also referred to
                            our desire to maintain friendship with both Indonesia and the
                            Netherlands, particularly as the Netherlands was an ally. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that we seem to tie
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in with this issue, and that
                            we should not—that we should have a real Asian policy, not complicated
                            by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> then asked

                            that an amendment would be offered making the resolution more general in
                            nature. President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            asked if the amendment would be our answer to the resolution and the
                            Secretary replied that it would represent our position on the matter. He
                            then explained some of the reasons why the meeting would not be possible
                            at this time under the present circumstances. He said that the personal
                            attacks on the President did not deter him from meeting with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> and then repeated
                            for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s benefit some of
                            the comments that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had
                            made about President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.
                            The Secretary pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> could not undertake conversations which would
                            commit a new administration particularly as a new President would be
                            elected in about five weeks. Despite these circumstances the Secretary
                            said that he had hoped he would hear from Gromyko but that he had
                            not.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> invited the
                            Secretary to be his guest in Indonesia while he was in office or after
                            his retirement. The Secretary said he appreciated the invitation and
                            would certainly like to have an opportunity to see Indonesia, but was
                            afraid that such a trip would not be possible.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the conversation was largely an exchange of pleasantries.</p>

                                >Sukarno</persName>. The following material has been prepared for
                            your use during this meeting.</p>

                                    >Sukarno</persName>’s Suspicions of the United States</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>. During the past several months we have
                            received a number of disquieting reports which suggest that the
                            Indonesian Government believes that the United States does not wish true
                            independence for Indonesia since the United States fears that Indonesia
                            would then adversely influence our <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> allies and since a strong Indonesia might stifle
                            United States economic interest in that country. There are clear
                            indications also that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            suspects that the United States is attempting to undermine his personal
                            position and to replace him with Indonesian leaders more sympathetic
                            with United States policies. The reasons behind <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s reported attitudes are
                            complex. He is, as you know, a vain and sensitive individual who
                            responds markedly to personal attention. He probably believes that the
                            Communist Bloc has been more sympathetic to Indonesia’s problems than
                            has been the United States and to justify this attitude he would cite
                            the visits of <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> to
                            Indonesia, the massive offers of economic and military assistance
                            extended by the Bloc to Indonesia over the past three years and the
                            Bloc’s unwavering support of the Indonesian position in that country’s
                            dispute with the Netherlands over West New Guinea. On the other hand,
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has been severely
                            disappointed over your inability to visit Indonesia. <pb n="554"
                                xml:id="pg_554" facs="0580"/>Disappointment has also been voiced by
                            the Indonesian Government over the lack of support from the United
                            States for Indonesia in the West New Guinea issue. In addition, the
                            Indonesians have also sometimes expressed less than complete
                            satisfaction with American aid which they have characterized as slow and
                            grudgingly given as compared with Communist Bloc assistance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is the key to the
                            course of political events in Indonesia and will likely remain so for
                            some time. The current political situation in Indonesia can be described
                            as an intense three-way power struggle with the Indonesian Army pitted
                            against the Communist Party and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> playing a balancing role
                            between these two antagonistic forces. In his efforts to forge a new
                            government structure to cope with Indonesia’s desire for economic
                            progress, <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> has
                            accepted the Communist Party as an element whose participation he
                            believes is important for the achievement of this objective. Thus
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s attitude toward
                            the Communists has inhibited efforts by the Indonesian Army to curb the
                            Party’s activities.</p>
                        <p>Part of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s suspicions
                            of the United States probably derive from our military assistance to the
                            anti-Communist Indonesian Army which we have extended since 1958. This
                            program may have generated a fear in <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s mind that we are building up and encouraging
                            the Indonesian Army to oust him. General <persName corresp="#p_NGAH1"
                                >Nasution</persName>, the Army Chief of Staff and leader of
                            Indonesia’s anti-Communist forces, has, incidentally, just completed a
                            successful visit to Washington during which he was cordially received by
                            several high level United States officials including the Secretaries of
                            State and Defense.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, we deem it imperative that we do everything
                            possible to allay these suspicions on <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>’s part.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> remarked
                            that the passage of five years found them both older but he
                            congratulated President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> on his healthful appearance. This was in
                            response to the President’s remark that he had undergone three rather
                            severe illnesses since they last met.</p>
                        <p>The President took the initiative in raising the matter of the resolution
                            sponsored by the five neutral powers in the United Nations, of which
                            Indonesia was one. The President assured <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> that he did not question their motive, in fact
                            he was 100% in accord with the objective they were trying to serve. He
                            dwelt on the theme that the armaments race and general tension was
                            leading to a most unsatisfactory situation and that anyone who desired
                            peace and tranquillity could not help but be disturbed by this growing
                            confrontation. The President explained to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> why the gesture of merely
                            getting together with <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>
                            was futile and in our view productive of further tension rather than a
                            lessening of it. He said that over the weekend he had given very serious
                            thought as to what his own personal attitude ought to be and what stance
                            the United States should take. He realized that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> disliked him intensely
                            personally. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> had acted
                            with extreme rudeness, but even with all of this if there was anything
                            that could be served by the President humbling himself and setting aside
                            his personal feelings, he of course should be very happy to do it. At
                            this point in the conversation <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> told the President that the neutrals of course
                            had withdrawn their resolution last night at the United Nations because
                            they were not receptive to the amendments suggested by Australia.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he felt that
                            a meeting between the two if it had accomplished nothing else would
                            break the ice.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to explain the situation after the U–2 incident and
                            the meeting in Paris. He made reference to the fact that the revelation
                            that we were conducting such operations as the U–2 was not any great new
                            news to the Soviets. This was one of the facts of life that had been
                            recognized between the two powers for some time, but even with this
                            knowledge if <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> felt that
                            this U–2 incident prevented their getting together and necessitated the
                            cancellation of his visit to Russia that he could have said so in
                            Moscow. He did not need to come to Paris in order to make his position
                            clear. It was therefore obvious that <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> was determined to make as much propaganda as
                            possible out of the breakup in Paris. He knew, for instance, that it
                            would be impossible for the President of the United States to meet his
                            demands for an apology. The President also remarked to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that the accident of the
                            location of the United Nations placed <persName corresp="#p_KNS2"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> in the United States but that this fact had
                            no practical bearing on their getting together. If it had not been for
                            the United Nations meeting there would of course be no possibility of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName> being invited to
                            the United States. <persName corresp="#p_KNS2">Khrushchev</persName>’s
                            being in the United States therefore seemed to appear to <pb n="557"
                                xml:id="pg_557" facs="0583"/>many as a natural opportunity to get
                            together which really was not true. He was as “distant” as though he
                            were still in Moscow. The President returned to the point of assuring
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that it was only
                            the firm conviction that nothing would be accomplished which caused him
                            to reject the idea of a meeting and that he wanted <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> to understand it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> maintained his
                            viewpoint that they should and that part of the conversation ended.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to ask <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> about Indonesia and how they were getting along.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said they were
                            making progress. He said, for instance, in 1955 they were producing
                            about 5-1/2 million tons of rice, now it is seven million. In 1955 they
                            were importing a million tons of rice, now it is 250,000 tons. He said
                            that his planning people tell him that by 1965 they should be
                            self-sufficient, this despite the fact that their population is now 92
                            million as against 72 million when they gained independence. In response
                            to a question about their literacy, he pointed out that at the inception
                            of independence illiteracy was 94%, it is now 40%, by 1965 it would be
                            zero. He gave some other interesting statistics on education. In 1949
                            there were only three-quarters of a million students mostly in the
                            elementary grades, now there are eight million students in schools, with
                            a very large growth in their high schools during this period. He made
                            personal reference to the fact that when he was studying engineering he
                            was one of eleven students in the university grades or in higher
                            technical studies. Today they have 55,000 in the universities. The
                            President asked <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> about
                            the <gloss target="#t_USS1">USS</gloss> Hope which was on its way to
                            Indonesia. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said they
                            would certainly welcome it and he would take the opportunity to visit
                            it. In talking of Indonesia’s health problem with specific reference to
                            malaria, he said that Indonesia had probably made the most progress of
                            any country in southern Asia in abolishing malaria and that by 1965 they
                            hoped to have it eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Turning to economics <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            explained their eight-year plan which was to cost 250 billion rupiahs.
                            There was some difficulty translating this into dollars due to the
                            uncertain value of the rupiah. He said that by 1965 they would have
                            their own blast furnaces. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> reminded the President that the United States
                            had its initial problems too and that they were therefore not
                            particularly discouraged with the many problems they face now. The
                            President humorously responded, what do you mean “used to have our
                            problems, we have plenty now”. He recalled that a philosopher had said
                            that “when the human family successfully eliminates its difficulties it
                            will die”. He referred to Gibbon’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Rise
                                and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi> and said that Rome fell because it
                            had seemingly eliminated its problems. It became soft and thus
                            deteriorated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said he was most
                            disappointed that the President had never visited Indonesia. The
                            President very tactfully pointed out that in <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558"
                                facs="0584"/>both of the trips which he made into various parts of
                            Asia the problem turned out to be one of time, that in a large country
                            like Indonesia he could not stop for a mere courtesy call as he had done
                            in some small countries but that he felt it would be insulting to come
                            to Indonesia unless he could have stayed a week. He told <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that he was most anxious to
                            come and that next year he was going to be a private citizen, and if
                            Indonesia would give him a visa he would think very seriously of coming
                            to Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, an area he was most anxious to
                            visit. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> smilingly
                            turned to <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Subandrio</persName> and told him
                            to make sure that the President got his visa.</p>
                        <p>The President told <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> he
                            wanted to return to the discussion of the United Nations. He
                            specifically mentioned the Congo. He said that prior to <persName

                            trips to the United Nations, he had talked to African leaders. He had,
                            for instance, been very impressed by Olympio<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2"
                                >Sylvanus E. Olympio, Prime Minister of Togo.</note> and he had also
                            talked with Bourguiba’s son. He explained to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> that a situation such as we
                            faced in the Congo simply had to be handled by the United Nations and
                            that those contributing forces to the security force must ensure that
                            they were subject to the United Nations command. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> said that he accepted this
                            completely and reminded the President that a battalion of Indonesian
                            troops had just landed in the Congo and that they had been taken there
                            by an American carrier. It was quite obvious that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> was not willing to accept
                            our interpretation of what was going on in the Congo and he asked the

                            that the United Nations must be supported for this was the only way. The
                            President assured him that the United States was staying strictly out of
                            the internal complications, but merely wanted the Congolese to be able
                            to settle their own internal affairs without outside interference.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> if
                            they had their own airlines and he said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_Garuda1">Garuda</gloss> Airlines were the Indonesian
                            national airlines; however for long trips he preferred Pan American. For
                            this trip he had chartered a jet 707. The President recounted the early
                            days of Pan American and the clippers that crossed the Pacific taking
                            five days instead of a few hours now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> asked the President
                            where he was going to live when he retired. He said Gettysburg but he

                            being very active. He thought he might write a book, travel a few months
                            every year and do a bit of painting. Someone suggested some lectures,
                            but he said emphatically he had done enough talking and this did not
                            interest him. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            responded that he too had been approached about lecturing in

                        <p>After the opening exchange of amenities and in response to a reference by
                            the President to his reception of Indonesian President <persName

                                xml:id="d287fn1">See <ref target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note>
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> launched into a
                            presentation of the Dutch concern about the situation of West New
                            Guinea. In this connection he said that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName>, having tried four times unsuccessfully to
                            secure a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution <pb n="560"
                                xml:id="pg_560" facs="0586"/>on the question, had been saying that
                            it was now clear the New Guinea issue could only be settled by a
                            “surgical operation.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            said the Dutch could not mount a substantial military effort in <gloss
                                target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss> and that the only thing which could
                            surely stop <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> from
                            aggressive action would be a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> warning
                            that it would act against such aggression. After Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>’ exposition, the President asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> why the <gloss
                                target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss> problem had not been settled at the
                            time of the “shotgun separation” of the Netherlands and Indonesia. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied that <gloss
                                target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss> had always been separate from
                            Indonesia. They were different races of peoples. At the Round Table
                            Conference the Dutch had said that the Papuans were not yet in a
                            position to make a choice. The matter was to be reconsidered in a year
                            but in that year Indonesia had by force changed the Indonesian Union
                            into a unitary state thus destroying the basis on which a solution had
                            been contemplated. Since that time <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> had been using the Dutch as a whipping boy over
                            the issue of <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>. Dutch nationals had
                            been ousted, property confiscated, debts repudiated, diplomatic
                            relations terminated. Now no instrument was left to <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> except the use of force.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> reiterated the fear he
                            had expressed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> in his interview on September 23 that <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would stage an alleged
                            Dutch attack on Indonesia to justify moving into West New Guinea.<note

                                Roijen</persName> supplemented Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName>’ statement by pointing out that Indonesia had no
                            rights whatsoever to <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>; in fact the
                            Dutch had proposed that this question of alleged rights and obligations
                            be taken to the International Court of Justice but the Indonesians had
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired as to the feelings of the Indonesian people
                            about <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s claims to
                                <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> replied that the Indonesian government was a
                            dictatorship. The people were in fact uninformed but they supported
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> on the basis of
                            his political power. He went on to say that the threat to the Australian
                            position in eastern New Guinea, if Indonesia took over <gloss
                                target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>, would be very serious. The President
                            replied that he recognized this and was concerned. He had made these
                            inquiries in order to know more about the problem. He had the impression
                            that <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss> was much more an expense to the
                            Dutch than an asset. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName>
                            confirmed that this was the case. However, he said, the Dutch have a
                            responsibility toward the Papuans to uphold the same principle of
                            self-determination under which Indonesia itself had become independent.
                            The President then asked what would happen if the West New Guineans
                            themselves wanted to unite with the eastern part of the Island. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied that this would
                            be all right. What the Dutch <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0587"
                            />were now doing, he said, was preparing the Papuans to make a choice.
                            It was possible that they would choose union with Australian New Guinea
                            or that they would seek links either with the Dutch or with the
                            Australians or with both.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired about the state of the population in West New
                            Guinea, particularly as respects literacy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied that there were about 500
                            schools including a number of high schools. The first Papuans were now
                            ready for university studies. The Papuans were increasingly being
                            brought into the governmental administration and the Dutch goal was to
                            make the administration 95% Papuan at the earliest possible moment. He
                            then repeated that the population of <gloss target="#t_WNG1">WNG</gloss>
                            was no kin to the Indonesians. The President asked whether they were a
                            type of Polynesian as found in the other Pacific Islands. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> replied affirmatively and went on
                            to say that he had had a long talk with Prime Minister Nehru about this
                            problem. Nehru had admitted that the Dutch were on the right track but
                            he did not know whether this would be reflected in the Indian position
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He then reiterated his fear
                            that <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> would launch
                            trumped up charges as a prelude to military intervention. He hoped that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> could be
                            discreetly warned against any such action. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YP1">Young</persName> commented that Secretary
                                <persName>Dulles</persName> had delivered a rather sharp warning to
                            the Indonesians in 1958 which had been effective at that time.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he had asked about the literacy situation because
                            in his talk with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            yesterday <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had said
                            that at the time of Indonesian independence 94% of the population was
                            illiterate but that this figure had now been reduced to 40% and that the
                            Indonesians expected to reduce it to zero by 1965. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had said that there were
                            15,000 new schools in Indonesia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> said this was a typically false statement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> himself was an
                            example of the educational system the Dutch had developed in Indonesia
                            and was a graduate of the University of Batavia. The President said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had admitted this
                            but alleged there were only eleven such graduates. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> retorted that in his speech to the
                            United Nations <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had
                            actually equated “democracy” with “unanimity” also. In Indonesia itself
                            he had destroyed the free press. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJ12"
                                >Luns</persName> repeated that this was a grave problem to which he
                            would ask the President to give earnest consideration. The President
                            replied that he would discuss the matter with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and that Mr. <persName

                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> had met in Washington and
                            had a good conversation.<note n="1" xml:id="d288fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d286">Document 286</ref>.</note> Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> agreed with the Secretary’s
                            sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Then the Secretary said that he had been disturbed by a phrase which had
                            appeared in President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                            >Sukarno</persName>’s speech before the General Assembly. The President
                            in speaking of West Irian had used the phrase “surgical operation.” The
                            Secretary asked if this implied the use of force in the settlement of
                            the West Irian dispute.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> said that the
                            problem of West Irian had existed for many years. He hoped that the
                            Netherlands would ultimately agree to a peaceful solution of this
                            problem. Indonesia had promised Australia that there would be no use of
                            force in solving the problem of West Irian. However, the Dutch seemed
                            bent on reinforcing their military in West Irian and in carrying out
                            military reconnaissance in a provocative way. If the Dutch continue
                            these activities it will provoke a section of the army interested in a
                            military revenge on the Dutch and other elements in Indonesia which
                            would not be above promoting a military conflict over West Irian.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is trying
                            to suppress such warlike sentiments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> pointed out that
                            the U.S. has wanted to be meticulous in assuring that U.S. arms which
                            were being made available to Indonesia <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563"
                                facs="0589"/>would not be used in any military conflict with the
                            Dutch. At this point Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Soebandrio</persName> again referred to the Dutch activities
                            mentioned above and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> emphasized that he wanted to be sure that U.S.
                            arms will not be used unless there is some provocation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> said that Indonesia bears
                            the possible use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arms by the
                            Dutch in this conflict; and he asked Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> to please do whatever he could
                            to calm the Dutch. To this the Secretary replied that we have done
                            everything we could to calm the Dutch and he repeated that we do not
                            want to have our arms used for conflict in this dispute. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> brought this part of the
                            conversation to a close by referring to the fact that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi> seems to have disappeared. He
                            mentioned that the cruise of the <hi rend="italic">Karel Doorman</hi>
                            hurt relations with Japan and he underscored the fact that the
                            Indonesians are very sensitive about this dispute. At this point both
                            the Secretary and the Minister agreed that the West Irian dispute gave
                            the communists a subject on which to stir up trouble which is in accord
                            with their general policy.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the discussion on the use of force, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> asked the Secretary for
                            suggestions on how to solve the West Irian problem. The Secretary said
                            that the U.S. had always hoped that the problem would be solved when the
                            Indonesians and the Dutch set down to develop an amicable and peaceful
                            plan. To this <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName>
                            countered that the Indonesians had introduced a resolution into the
                            United Nations calling on the Dutch to negotiate; but the resolution had
                            failed. The Secretary then suggested that since the Dutch had turned
                            over certain islands to the Republic of Indonesia and retained certain
                            others, without arousing any complaint from the GOI, he wondered whether
                            the case of West Irian could not be settled by the International Court
                            of Justice. To this <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName>
                            countered that the dispute is really a political one rather than a
                            juridical one. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            asked if it really is political. He expressed the belief that it is a
                            good case for the ICJ to handle. Then he said that he understood that by
                            using the word “political” Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Soebandrio</persName> was in fact drawing attention to the domestic
                            emotion involved in the dispute.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName>, still pursuing the
                            problem, explained that ethnic differences between various sections of
                            Indonesia are as great as between West Irian and Indonesia. However, he
                            felt that the Dutch were becoming more tolerant and that there was a
                            trend “to get rid of West Irian.” There was the matter of Dutch public
                            opinion, but Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> felt
                            the Dutch public opinion would eventually permit the Dutch government to
                            get rid of West Irian if it could find a suitable formula. He expressed
                            the hope that the U.S. could sound out the Dutch on a solution to the
                            dispute. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2">Soebandrio</persName> discussed
                            briefly the <persName corresp="#p_LJ12">Luns</persName> proposal on West
                            Irian at the U.N. and concluded that while it was unclear, he was
                            suggesting some sort of <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0590"
                            />trusteeship arrangement. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SSD2"
                                >Soebandrio</persName> seemed to feel that this would be a possible
                            step in the direction of permitting the Dutch people ultimately to
                            accept the transfer of West Irian to Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Concluding the discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> stated that we have been counselors of moderation

                        <p>On October 12 the Director of the Policy Planning Staff, Gerard C. Smith,
                            transmitted a paper entitled ’The Problem of West New Guinea (West
                            Irian)” in response to a request on July 2 by Under Secretary of State,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Livingston T. Merchant</persName>, for
                            such a study. The paper included a 12-page discussion of the problem
                            which was defined as follows: “to determine whether the <gloss

                            controversy over West New Guinea, which is now one of neutrality, should
                            be modified and, if so, how.” In addition to the discussion section,
                            there were 5 pages of conclusions and 1 of recommendations. The
                            recommendations read as follows: <list>

                                    in discussions with the respective parties.</item>

                        <p rend="center">DRAFT STATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY ON INDONESIA</p>
                        <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                        <p>1. The chief danger confronting U.S. policy with respect to Indonesia is
                            that a combination of domestic instability, burgeoning Sino-Soviet Bloc
                            economic and military aid, and substantial local Communist strength may
                            lead to a Communist takeover or to a policy increasingly friendly toward
                            the Sino-Soviet Bloc on the part of whatever regime is in power. The
                            size and importance of Indonesia, together with its strategic position
                            in relation to Australia and Free Asia, and the serious consequences of
                            its loss to Communist control, dictate a vigorous U.S. effort to prevent
                            these contingencies.</p>
                        <p>2. Basically, any non-Communist Indonesian regime likely to come to power
                            will desire to follow a “neutralist” policy, seeking aid on its own
                            terms from both the Free World and the Bloc and balancing each off
                            against the other. It is unlikely that any foreseeable non-Communist
                            regime will depart from this basic policy, even though there is growing
                            concern among Indonesians, including the Army, over the magnitude of
                            Communist strength and the extent of aid accepted from the Bloc. Many
                            Indonesian leaders remain suspicious of Western motives. These leaders,
                            preoccupied with colonialism, focus their criticism on the Western
                            European attitude toward nationalist movements in Africa and Asia, and
                            especially toward the West New Guinea issue. Formal political
                            commitments to either the Free World or the Soviet Bloc would constitute
                            in their minds unacceptable abridgement of their international freedom
                            of action; and regional military security pacts are opposed on the
                            grounds that they increase rather than reduce international tension.</p>
                        <p>3. Indonesia has certain advantages and points of strength. It shares no
                            common boundary with a Communist state. Although the Indonesians have an
                            extremely low per capita cash income, a salubrious climate and fertile
                            soil make the crushing poverty and starvation characteristic of some
                            Asian nations rare in Indonesia. A predominantly subsistence economy
                            cushions most Indonesians from adverse commercial and financial
                            developments. While there is severe over-population on Java and much
                            “shared poverty,” absentee landlordism and glaring inequalities <pb
                                n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0598"/>in land distribution are almost
                            unknown. Western concepts of individual freedom and democratic
                            government find some parallel in the democratic structure of the
                            Indonesian village and the Indonesian tradition of compromise and
                            collective decision-making.</p>
                        <p>4. On the other hand, Indonesia was ill-prepared to face the problems and
                            assume the responsibilities of independence. The educational policy of
                            the colonial regime prevented the development of an indigenous civil
                            service and a corps of trained professional men. Dutch economic policy
                            militated against the growth of an Indonesian entrepreneurial class. The
                            Dutch policy of regarding all political activity as subversive prevented
                            the acquisition of a healthy political experience and a knowledge and
                            understanding of political techniques; rather, a pattern of negativism,
                            opportunism and irresponsible obstructionism has emerged. Finally, Dutch
                            administrative policies tended to preserve and accentuate regional and
                            ethnic differences.</p>

                            relatively well-organized, well-financed, and well-led. It is unique
                            among Indonesian political parties in its discipline, unity of purpose,
                            and command of the techniques of political action. It also dominates the
                            Indonesian labor movement through its labor federation, <gloss
                                target="#t_SOBSI1">SOBSI</gloss>, and its electoral strength is
                            particularly concentrated in central and east Java. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>, which has capitalized on internecine
                            quarrels, venality, and incompetence in the non-Communist parties,
                            demonstrated in 1957 and 1958 local elections its steadily increasing
                            popular support. If the election scheduled originally for 1959 had been
                            held, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> would probably have
                            emerged as the largest party in Indonesia and would have been in a
                            strong position to use this as a base to demand cabinet representation.
                            However, it now appears that elections may be postponed until 1962. The
                            party has established itself in a strong psychological position by
                            refraining from overt extra-legal activities and strongly supporting
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s policies and
                            political concepts, most effectively with respect to the issues of the
                            rebellion of 1958 and the sovereignty of West New Guinea. Recently, in
                            an effort to discredit the present non-Communist government while
                            sustaining superficially undiminished support for <persName

                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has directed stinging criticism at the
                            effectiveness of government methods of achieving policy goals. At the
                            same time, it is free of any responsibility for government failures and
                            inadequacies since it has not been formally represented in any cabinet.
                            Since the return to the executive-president type 1945 Constitution in

                            Parliament and the People’s Consultative Congress, thus reflecting
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            conviction that all major elements of Indonesian society should have a
                            voice in policy formation. Of the nation’s highest level executive and
                            deliberative organs, only the cabinet has thus far remained free of
                            Communist membership. In the circumstances now prevailing, in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is vigorously
                            urging cooperation between nationalist, religious and Communist
                            elements, the possibility that the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>
                            may be able to secure one or more cabinet posts must be recognized. Open
                            measures of repression against the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>,
                            although frequently undertaken by the Army, are difficult to justify on
                            internal political grounds, and expose their perpetrators to charges of
                            truckling to Western pressure. At present the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> probably lacks the resources to seize power by overt
                            force, and postponement of the elections may delay a bid for power via
                            the polls. However, there is a serious and continuing danger that
                            Indonesia may fall to Communism through Government inadequacy, Communist
                            subversion, legal political means, or, as a last resort, by
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> efforts have been complemented in
                            the external field by the Sino-Soviet Bloc, which since September 1956
                            has offered to Indonesia approximately one billion dollars in military
                            and economic credits. Arms and military equipment not available from
                            Free World sources, which have pursued a policy of limited assistance to
                            Indonesia in the military sphere, have been obtained by use of these
                            Soviet Bloc credits. Additionally, the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss> has benefited from consistent and vigorous Soviet Bloc
                            support of Indonesia’s claim to West New Guinea and from the support,
                            diplomatic and propaganda, offered by the Bloc during the 1958
                            rebellion.</p>
                        <p>7. The anti-Communist political groups in Indonesia have clearly lost
                            ground in the recent past. However, in the past year many non-Communist
                            leaders and political parties have demonstrated a greater realization of
                            the Communist danger facing their country and appear more willing than
                            before to cooperate among themselves and with the Army to give Indonesia
                            a more effective government and check the growth of Communist strength
                            and influence. The most recent example of this encouraging development
                            was the establishment in mid-1960 of the Democratic League, a loose
                            political coalition comprising Christian, Moslem, Nationalist and
                            Socialist elements. Formation of the League was made possible by the
                            presence of discreet Army support and, although the successes of the
                            League were limited, the basis for future further cooperation was
                            established. Despite this more recent tendency to cooperate among the
                            anti- and non-Communist parties, they remain severely divided by
                            factional strife and ideological considerations and hampered by
                            indecisiveness and poor organization. As a result of recent Presidential
                            action, both the <gloss target="#t_Masjumi1">Masjumi</gloss> and
                            Socialist parties have been <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0600"
                            />disbanded and, although their members continue to exert influence in
                            anti-Communist circles as individuals, the magnitude of formal
                            opposition to the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> nonetheless has
                            been significantly reduced as a result of these parties’ demise. These
                            non-Communist elements, however, continue to comprise a significant
                            element of Indonesian society which is seeking to steer a course
                            designed to avoid authoritarian rule in Indonesia by <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>, the military or the
                            Communists. They exercise a stabilizing influence on political
                            developments in Indonesia and, to a somewhat lesser extent, on
                            Indonesian foreign policy expressions. In present-day Indonesia,
                            however, a basic necessity for development of this anti-Communist
                            potential to more effective proportions is strong military backing.</p>
                        <p>8. The Indonesian political stage continues to be dominated by the
                            President, the Army and the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss>. In the
                            past two years the Army, under the leadership of General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, has sharpened its awareness
                            of Communist policy and has sought to curb wherever possible the more
                            flagrant of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> acts to undermine
                            the effectiveness of the government. In these developments, the Army has
                            had the cooperation of First Minister Djuanda and the prominent
                            anti-Communist elements mentioned above. The most striking development
                            in Indonesia in the past one and a half years has been the rapid
                            consolidation of the organs of political expression into the hands of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Since
                            promulgation by decree of the present constitution of July 5, 1959, and
                            the formation of a new cabinet in which <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> assumed for himself the post of Prime Minister,
                            other top level government policy-forming organs, such as the
                            Parliament, the Supreme Advisory Council, the National Planning Council
                            and the People’s Consultative Congress, have been either re-vamped or
                            established on the President’s terms, including appointments made
                            personally by the President. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> thus is now in a position to impose his policies
                            on the nation through a legalistic facade of his own making. All of the
                            government organs mentioned above, with the exception of the cabinet,
                            contain Communist representation and thus are consonant with <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s concept of “Gotong
                            Rojong— mutual cooperation” as a means of developing his unique theory
                            of guided democracy. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                            remains Indonesia’s most prominent political element. He retains his
                            position due to a number of factors. The first of these is the role that
                            he played in the Indonesian revolution and the symbol that his person
                            constitutes as an embodiment of the Indonesian state. He retains the
                            respect of the Javanese masses and to a lesser extent that of common
                            Indonesians in the outer islands. Another reason for <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s position is his
                            extraordinary, almost mystic, ability as a political practitioner. In a
                            nation with many contending internal forces, <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> alone continues to be a
                            meeting point for the conflicting ideologies and through his balancing,
                            maneuvering, encouraging and rejecting <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575"
                                facs="0601"/>he has made himself politically indispensable. Still
                            another reason for <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            prominence, a reason related to his personal popularity, is that all of
                            the diverse political elements in the nation hope to exploit his
                            personal stature to achieve their own ends, and one of his political
                            techniques is that the door is never quite closed to the possibility
                            that this or that group might be able to achieve this aim. Despite
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s position, he
                            keenly feels the lack of a strong organized mass political base loyal to
                            him personally. Unlike other national leaders in Asia, <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is neither the titular nor
                            actual head of a political party machine. Several previous attempts to
                            establish such a political organization, such as through the medium of
                            the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, have not been
                            successful. A current campaign to develop such a political base for
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> may be found in
                            the plans now being formulated for the establishment of a national
                            political front, in which will be represented the various political and
                            power forces of the nation. It appears that technical formation of the
                            front may be delegated to the Army, and it may be anticipated that this
                            will sharpen to a degree the struggle for power between <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and the anti-Communist Army
                            leadership. Although a substantial segment of the educated elite of
                            Indonesia questions <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s
                            ability to provide constructive leadership for Indonesia, his ability as
                            a balancer of forces, his position vis-à-vis the masses, and the lack of
                            attainable alternatives combine to further his indispensability. He is a
                            living national monument, a political fact of life which must be lived
                            with.</p>
                        <p>9. The Indonesian Army is the largest element of the Indonesian armed
                            forces. The Army and the predominantly non-Communist orientation of its
                            officer corps represent the principal obstacles to the continued growth
                            of Communist strength in Indonesia. This situation derives to a
                            considerable degree from the favorable impressions made on the several
                            hundred Indonesian officers trained in U.S. service schools, many of
                            whom now hold responsible positions. These officers have accepted U.S.
                            organization, equipment, and training methods and, upon return to their
                            homeland, have exerted a strong influence in orienting the Army toward
                            the West and toward the United States in particular.</p>
                        <p>10. Under the leadership of the anti-Communist General <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>, the Army has assumed an
                            increasingly powerful position in the political arena including a
                            growing policy-making role. The Army is likely to continue to exercise
                            considerable authority in civil affairs barring an open break between
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGAH1">Nasution</persName>. The Army’s increased power
                            has in part resulted from two factors: the considerable authority it is
                            permitted under the present “state of emergency,” and the prestige
                            accruing from its success in suppressing the regional revolt. The Army’s
                            objective is to steer a middle-of-the-road course designed to implement
                            both in domestic and international terms Indonesia’s neutralist position
                                <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0602"/>in the cold war, a
                            fundamental concept widely approved even among those Indonesians most
                            apprehensive over the advances of the <gloss target="#t_PKI1"
                                >PKI</gloss>. In these terms, the Army will continue to suppress and
                            frustrate <gloss target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> aims, recognizing them as
                            inimical to the welfare of the nation. At the same time, the Army will
                            not accede to the demands of the extreme Moslem right which favors a
                            theocratic state and a large measure of local autonomy. Although Navy
                            and Air Force leaders have in the past had relatively minor influence in
                            national affairs, their role in this respect now is increasing and they
                            may be expected in the future to demand a more prominent part in policy
                            decisions. Unlike the Army, which has preferred to obtain matériel
                            support mostly from Free World sources, the Air Force in the past and
                            more recently the Navy have turned to the Soviet Bloc for large scale
                            assistance in procuring military hardware. There is strong evidence,
                            however, that the decisions to obtain Soviet Bloc equipment have in part
                            been made with some misgivings and have resulted in the recent past from
                            an inability to obtain such items in desired quantities from the Free
                            World.</p>
                        <p>11. Until recent years the Indonesian armed forces were equipped with
                            weapons, aircraft and ships of varied origin and type, including Dutch,
                            British, United States and Japanese, primarily of World War II vintage
                            or earlier. Spurred on by the impending rebellion and the fear of a
                            would-be Dutch attack in late 1957, the Indonesian Government began to
                            make major purchases of military equipment abroad. Because the United
                            States and other Free World countries were generally unwilling to sell
                            military equipment to Indonesia at that time, approaches were made to
                            the Soviet Bloc and an Indonesian military procurement mission was
                            dispatched to Bloc countries. Since that time Indonesia has procured
                            over $200 million of Bloc military equipment on long term credit terms,
                            primarily for the Air Force (jet fighters and bombers, transports and
                            trainers) and the Navy (patrol craft, destroyers and submarines). Army
                            purchases of Bloc equipment (mostly standard hardware) have been
                            relatively modest. The Indonesian Navy is currently negotiating an
                            additional credit purchase agreement with the Soviet Union which would
                            cover a number of heavy warships, submarines, patrol and service vessels
                            and training reportedly totaling approximately $300 million. In view of
                            Indonesia’s “active and independent” policy and the generous Bloc
                            offers, continuing Indonesian purchases of military equipment from the
                            Bloc can be expected.</p>
                        <p>12. In view of the emerging importance of the military as a stabilizing
                            and anti-Communist force in Indonesia, the United States since mid-1958
                            has been furnishing modest quantities of military equipment to Indonesia
                            in response to long-standing Indonesian requests. Since Indonesia is
                            unwilling because of its policy of non-alignment to conclude a standard
                            military assistance agreement with the United States, this assistance
                                <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0603"/>has been provided under a
                            sales agreement concluded on August 13, 1958, whereby military equipment
                            has been delivered to Indonesia for its internal security and
                            self-defense in return for token payment in local currency. The
                            necessary Presidential Determinations under the appropriate section of
                            the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, have been obtained to
                            provide military programs for Indonesia not to exceed $22 million in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, $20 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 and $21 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961. The large part of the U.S.
                            equipment furnished has gone to the Indonesian Army since we regard this
                            service as the best vehicle for maintaining a measure of stability and
                            anti-Communist alertness in Indonesia. Smaller amounts of equipment have
                            been furnished to the Navy and the Air Force to minimize inter-service
                            jealousies and to avoid spotlighting the Army as an instrument of U.S.
                            policy. U.S. assistance is believed to have contributed in part to the
                            growing anti-Communist posture of the Army, and assistance to the Navy
                            has helped in some measures to enhance U.S. ties with that service. U.S.
                            relations with the leftist Air Force leadership continue to leave much
                            to be desired although recent Air Force inquiries about U.S. equipment
                            may possibly indicate a greater receptivity toward the procurement of
                            U.S. military items. Taking into account the uncertainties of the
                            Indonesian situation, U.S. military assistance to Indonesia is limited
                            and selective and subject to continuing review in light of developments
                            in that country. The United States also takes into account the concerns
                            expressed by the Netherlands and Australia about a military build-up in
                            Indonesia and the possibility of Indonesian armed action against West
                            New Guinea; In this connection, Indonesia has now furnished the United
                            States with written assurances that U.S.-furnished equipment will not be
                            used against West New Guinea. In addition to the United States, other
                            Free World countries including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany
                            and Japan have sold substantial quantities of military equipment to
                            Indonesia since 1958.</p>
                        <p>13. U.S. policy has for a number of years called for the provision of
                            both technical assistance and economic aid to Indonesia. Since 1950 U.S.
                            assistance to Indonesia in the economic sphere has totaled approximately
                            $372 million and may be divided into three categories: <list>

                        <p rend="flushleft">In the past few years Indonesia has become increasingly
                            receptive to U.S. economic assistance and is now actively seeking such
                            assistance. While generally quite satisfied with the substance of U.S.
                            assistance, Indonesia has occasionally expressed dissatisfaction with
                            the lengthy and complicated negotiations involved in U.S. aid
                            transactions. Indonesia also receives various types of technical and
                            economic assistance from Free World nations through the Colombo Plan. In
                            addition, Indonesia is receiving war reparations from Japan through an
                            agreement concluded in 1958. Since 1956, the Soviet Bloc has offered
                            Indonesia almost a half billion dollars in economic assistance. Bloc
                            offers have taken the form of announcements of willingness to make
                            available large sums in the form of long-term, low interest rate credits
                            without any indication of the specific uses of the funds. These
                            announcements are exploited vigorously for their propaganda value,
                            although the subsequent negotiations over the use of the funds have
                            sometimes been considerably protracted. The initial Soviet offer in 1956
                            was not accepted by the Indonesians until 1958. Actual expenditures
                            under the Bloc economic credits have to date totalled only about $80
                            million. Bloc equipment furnished under the programs has not always been
                            satisfactory, although deliveries have been prompt once country
                            decisions were made as to the nature of the goods to be imported.
                            Considerable numbers of Bloc technicians are employed in Indonesia on
                            these projects.</p>
                        <p>14. The Indonesian Government fiscal and financial situation, although
                            recovered slightly from the depths suffered approximately one year ago,
                            remains a matter of major concern. In the past three years, additional
                            heavy burdens have been imposed on the already unstable economy by a
                            series of developments: the outer island rebellion of 1958 which,
                            although no longer a military threat to the central government,
                            continues in the form of acts of economic attrition such as large-scale
                            smuggling of rubber and copra and inciting of turmoil in the countryside
                            which prevents the development of productive agriculture; the anti-Dutch
                            campaign during which Dutch-owned assets were seized by the Government
                            and thousands of Dutch nationals, many of them technicians, departed
                            from Indonesia; and the decree effective January 1, 1960, forbidding
                            aliens, most of whom were Chinese, to transact retail business in rural
                            areas. Added to the above is the demonstrated inability of the
                            Indonesian Government to develop and pursue a realistic attainable
                            economic or fiscal plan. Such planning as has been accomplished <pb
                                n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0605"/>has failed to meet economic
                            needs. The Indonesian masses, especially those outside metropolitan
                            areas, live on a subsistence economy and are relatively unaffected by
                            this situation, but the absence of economic development and the
                            inability of the Indonesian Government to provide needed public
                            services, such as schools, hospitals, roads and inter-island
                            communications, have contributed to dissatisfaction and political
                            unrest. These conditions have been exploited by the Communist Party,
                            particularly on the overcrowded island of Java, to win popular support.
                            Ultimately, actions to defeat Communism in Indonesia must, if they are
                            to have any hope of success, be supplementary to long-range effective
                            programs to improve the living standards of the masses and to
                            demonstrate capacity for progress in solving Indonesia’s serious
                            economic and social problems.</p>
                        <p>15. The shortage of trained professional men, administrators, and
                            technicians is an underlying obstacle to progress in the solution of
                            Indonesia’s manifold political, economic and social problems. The
                            Indonesian Government is making strenuous efforts to remedy this
                            deficiency, and this is one field in which U.S. assistance can pay great
                            long-range dividends.</p>
                        <p>16. In the 1958 rebellion, the regional leaders and their rebel forces in
                            the outer islands were no match for the government forces in regular
                            military operations. However, the rebels are proving to be effective
                            guerrilla fighters and are seriously harassing the government forces and
                            hampering there-establishment of effective civil authority in North and
                            Central Sumatra and North Celebes. Although the rebels lack the military
                            capability and the political following to re-establish their control of
                            major populated areas, they have some local support and can continue
                            guerrilla warfare for a prolonged period, creating serious economic and
                            political problems for the central government. Although most responsible
                            Indonesian elements will agree privately that the final solution to the
                            1958 rebellion lies not in military action but in political and economic
                            concessions and reform, an unyielding attitude of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> makes it politically
                            impossible for this realization to be stated publicly. There are
                            recently indications, however, that secret negotiations between the Army
                            and the rebels have taken place and that some measure of settlement
                            ultimately may be achieved. Since Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes produce a
                            major portion of Indonesian export earnings, they are of great
                            significance to the Indonesian economy. Regional distrust of the central
                            government, however, is likely to continue.</p>
                        <p>17. The unresolved dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands over
                            West New Guinea has become in Indonesia a major liability not only to
                            the United States and its European allies, but also to moderate elements
                            in Indonesia favoring a rapprochement with the Netherlands and closer
                            ties with the Free World. It has poisoned <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580"
                                facs="0606"/>Dutch-Indonesian relations, and undermined Indonesia’s
                            otherwise excellent relations with Australia. Internationally the Soviet
                            Bloc, by strongly supporting Indonesia’s position in the dispute, has on
                            frequent occasions successfully exploited Indonesia’s basic policy on
                            neutralism in the cold war by defining issues so as to practically force
                            Indonesia’s support as a matter of principle. Domestically, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PKI1">PKI</gloss> has used its strong support of the
                            Indonesian position as a major implement of policy. <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> is again agitating the New
                            Guinea issue, and the new Indonesian military purchases plus other
                            evidence suggest that the Indonesians will adopt a more activist and
                            threatening posture toward New Guinea, though overt military
                            intervention still seems unlikely.</p>
                        <p>18. The United States cannot expect to reap the full benefits of aid to
                            Indonesia while at the same time appearing to oppose Indonesian
                            aspirations on the one international issue which has aroused great
                            nationalist emotion in Indonesia and is a personal idée fixe with
                                <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>. Not to support
                            Indonesia on this issue is to leave this key gambit to the Communist
                            Bloc. On the other hand, a reversal of U.S. policy would create grave
                            complications with the Netherlands and Australia, with unforeseeable
                            results. However, it should be recognized that U.S. support of Indonesia
                            on the West New Guinea issue probably would not deflect Indonesia from
                            pursuing a basically neutralist course.</p>
                        <p>19. Our present policy has been followed because of the serious adverse
                            consequences which would ensue if the United States supported either the
                            Dutch or the Indonesian position. The former would drastically reduce if
                            not eliminate U.S. influence in Indonesia, deal a serious blow to

                                <item>A subsequent approach related, even with utmost subtlety, to
                                    our Military Assistance Program with Indonesia might be strongly
                                    resented by <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                    as an unacceptable implicit condition to United States
                                    assistance. There is a real danger that he might reject not only
                                    the plea on behalf of Mr. Pope but United States assistance as
                                    well. United States military assistance has been directed toward
                                    strengthening, in particular, the Indonesian Army, which is
                                    western-oriented. The point which is most important in
                                    considering the merits of this approach is that our military aid
                                    program has steadily enhanced our position with these
                                    anti-Communist elements as a counter to the instability of the
                                    President. <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>
                                    might actually welcome an issue of this emotional nature to
                                    justify the refusal of United States aid to his forces and turn

                                <item>Mr. Pope has not exhausted legal avenues for amelioration of
                                    his death sentence available to him under Indonesian law.
                                    Although the Appellate Court has confirmed the death penalty
                                    imposed by the lower court, he has a right either to appeal to
                                    the Supreme Court or to petition the President of Indonesia for
                                    executive clemency. An appeal to the Supreme Court would not act
                                    as a bar to a subsequent plea for executive clemency. On the
                                    basis of a report from our Ambassador, it appears that Mr. Pope
                                    intends to perfect an appeal to the Supreme Court. President

                                    is powerless in the matter until a formal appeal for executive
                                    clemency is made to him in accordance with Indonesian law. An
                                    approach now might lessen the effectiveness of such action as we
                                    might wish to take at a later date.</item>

                            this information without delay to the Indonesian Government, the

                                    stand on principle to do so without being submerged by the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>To Embassy it is obvious that only third alternative is practicable and
                            offers any hope of protecting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> national
                            interest in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Embassy has sought to point out at every opportunity that the problem
                            confronting the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is not whether
                            Indonesia will some day have an army, navy and air force befitting the
                            great power it intends to become, but only the direction from which help
                            will be derived in achieving this military strength.</p>
                        <p>It is unrealistic to expect Indos to reject offers of bombers, long-range
                            artillery, paratroop equip, capital ships and other offensive weapons
                            merely because these come from a Communist country. Certainly the army,
                            navy and perhaps even air force would prefer to avoid contagion of
                            communism if there were free world alternatives. There are none at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>In this situation all we can hope to do is prevent the Soviet drive from
                            destroying the influence of our friends utterly. This means that we must
                            be prepared to offer positive program contributing to goals Indos seek
                            without being led into excessive support of those things we regard as
                            unnecessary frills or purely offensive in character. At same time, if we
                            insist upon being too squeamish on either ground, we invite still
                            further Soviet offers.</p>
                        <p>Since navy is most critical immediate problem, Embassy has given most
                            attention to countering Soviet effort in this field.</p>
                        <p>Embassy, <gloss target="#t_MILTAG1">MILTAG</gloss> and Attachés have
                            considered what means might serve counter Soviet program and remain
                            within limitations established reference B. In connection this

                                >US</gloss> unwilling provide what they want. Case in point is Ratai

                        <p>There is no likelihood entirely heading off acceptance Soviet’s offer to
                            navy in view <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName>’s desire

                            foreign policy and his desire for prestige ships. Furthermore,
                            Indonesian naval leaders are determined to get on with their program of
                            building a navy suitable to their archipelago nation. However, it is
                            noteworthy that they have (as have army and initially <gloss
                                target="#t_AURI1">AURI</gloss>) consistently turned first to <gloss

                            offer only as second alternative.</p>
                        <p>Embassy believes naval leaders would respond favorably to reasonable
                            proposal which would serve as alternative to acceptance all vessels
                            Soviet Union has offered. Such proposal would have to be designed assist
                            them in beginning to develop a navy adequate to achievable national
                            objectives, which include not only coast guard and inter-island
                            shipping, but also internal security and self defense. In Indonesia
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> cannot, as it may be able do in
                            some countries heavily dependent upon <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            assistance, establish mission for navy, but can perhaps lead <gloss

                        <p>One positive way of doing this would be offer to assist <gloss

                            schools and assistance in supply and logistics essential for development
                            of sound navy. Greater use of <gloss target="#t_MTTS1">MTTS</gloss> will
                            not only serve military purposes but also materially aid <gloss

                            elsewhere for far less than outlay for Soviet equipment. Time required
                            to carry out such program, which would take several years, would afford
                            time for experience to temper exaggerated expectations this youthful
                            navy. If so, in spite of <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"

                        <p>In absence more positive approach as outlined above we will be left with

                        <p>In the course of his briefing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6"
                                >Gray</persName> dwelt on the West New Guinea problem and asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> to comment on the
                            pros and cons of our policy on this issue, on available alternatives to
                            present U.S. policy, and on possible solutions to the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said West New Guinea
                            represented a case where the national interests of the Netherlands and
                            Indonesia were in direct conflict. It would be difficult to exaggerate
                            the amount of emotion engendered in each country by this question.
                            Powerful arguments could be adduced for the support of either the Dutch
                            or the Indonesian position but, on balance, the Department of State
                            believed that the West New <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0617"
                            />Guinea case was similar to the Kashmir case in that the U.S. must
                            adopt a neutral attitude and endeavor to persuade both parties to
                            “de-fuse” the issue. The Netherlands was our loyal ally in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Indonesia was an important country
                            in Southeast Asia and although it tended at times to move toward the
                            Communist Bloc, it would probably move faster in that direction if we
                            supported the Dutch. Another factor in this situation was the impression
                            Indonesia had created in the Afro-Asian anti-colonial bloc, an
                            impression that the Western countries, including the U.S., were
                            “colonial powers.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName>
                            then noted that the U.S. had already begun extraordinarily secret
                            conversations with the Australians, looking toward a solution which
                            might eliminate Indonesia’s irritation with the Dutch and reconcile the
                            Dutch to the situation in Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> said defense
                            officials in the Netherlands were convinced that the Indonesians sooner
                            or later would attack West New Guinea. He wondered what the U.S. would
                            do in such an eventuality. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                >Merchant</persName> said the U.S. had many times warned Indonesia
                            against taking military action. Recently we had written pledges from
                            Indonesia that it would not use U.S. equipment for aggressive purposes
                            against West New Guinea. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> felt one
                            difficulty in West New Guinea lay in the fact that we have no U.S.
                            official constantly in the area and are hence not in a good position to
                            get early intelligence of a major military move.</p>
                        <p>The President wondered who would be the aggressor in the event of a clash
                            over West New Guinea. We would want to arrive at an accurate
                            identification of the aggressor. However, the Soviets and the Communist
                            Chinese would have a canned answer to the question of who is the
                            aggressor. The President added that the Dutch hope West New Guinea has
                            some value but he was unable to entertain such a hope. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> said West New Guinea was
                            mostly a national fetish, a symbol of the old Dutch Empire. He added
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JHP1">Jones</persName> and Mrs.
                            Pope had had a favorable interview with <persName corresp="#p_Sukarno1"
                                >Sukarno</persName> yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said that one of the fliers for the
                            Indonesian rebel forces had recently redefected to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_Sukarno1">Sukarno</persName> government. If he confesses
                            to his activities in the rebellion, Pope’s case may be prejudiced.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GTSJ1">Gates</persName> wondered whether
                            we could get Pope out of Indonesia. Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName> said
                            the matter was under study. However, if we made an attempt in this
                            direction and failed, Pope’s case for clemency would be destroyed.</p>
                        <p>The President felt it was necessary to devise better ways of finding
                            trustworthy people for government service. He was thinking about the
                            redefector mentioned by Mr. <persName>Dulles</persName>. Such a person
                            should not have <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0618"/>enough
                            information so that his confession upon redefection would be damaging.
                            The Martin–Mitchell case<note n="8" xml:id="d296fn8">Bernon F. Mitchell
                                and William H. Martin were two crytography experts at the National
                                Security Agency who defected to the Soviet Union in August
                                1960.</note> indicated that we did not succeed in keeping unreliable
                            people out of sensitive jobs. The President wondered whether we were
                            sufficiently aware of the problem and whether we were compartmentalizing
                            the information we provided some individuals to avoid their having too
                            wide a knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG6">Gray</persName> then concluded the
                            discussion of Indonesia by reading the last half of Page 3 and all of
