                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans, researches,
                    compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Official regulations codifying
                    specific standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series
                    were first promulgated by Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.
                    These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName>George Bush</persName> on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 USC 4351, <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
                    volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s administration. This

                </p>
                <p>The editor of the volume sought to present documentation illuminating
                    responsibility for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. Government, with
                    emphasis on the President and his advisers. The documents include memoranda and
                    records of discussions that set forth policy issues and options and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the
                    details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>The editor tried to document as much as possible the roles of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> and his key foreign policy
                    advisers, particularly his White House assistants <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W.
                        Rostow</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert
                        S. McNamara</persName>, and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName>, in the administration’s consideration of a wide range
                    of national security issues. Major topics covered in the volume include:
                    analyses of the Soviet military threat, the development of new U.S. weapons, the
                    question of U.S. development and deployment of an anti-ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) system, chemical and biological weapons,
                    tactical nuclear weapons, counter-insurgency policy, improvement of command and
                    control systems, and military force structure.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by
                    high-level policymakers, especially those that were made available to President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>has been supplied by the editors for each document included in
                    the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in
                    the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently
                    corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are corrected by
                    bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman
                    type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics.
                    Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the source text, and a
                    list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets that appear in
                    the source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                    monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises
                    on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The
                    Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes
                    in the series, but it makes recommendations on problems that come to its

                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1996 and was
                    completed in 2001, resulted in the decision to withhold about 3.5 percent of the
                    documentation proposed for publication; 9 documents were withheld in full. The
                    editor is confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing this
                    volume, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here provide an
                    accurate account of U.S. national security policy.</p>

                <p>Since 1861, the Department of State’s documentary series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> has constituted the official

                    the Office of the Historian collect, select, arrange, and annotate the principal
                    documents that make up the record of American foreign policy. The standards for
                    preparation of the series and general guidelines for the publication are

                <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>The main topics covered in this volume are the nuclear capabilities and
                    intentions of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, the status of
                    U.S. nuclear preparedness, issues of chemical and biological weapons, and
                    contingency plans in case of attack on the United States.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam war remained a preoccupation for the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration and affected its officials’ thoughts on
                    national security decisions, but the war itself is rarely mentioned in this
                    volume. Because the war affected both budgetary and personnel concerns among all
                    the armed services, it is referred to on occasion in documents dealing with
                    budget and force level issues. Readers desiring more specific information on the
                    Vietnam policies of the administration should consult <ref target="frus1964-68v01">volumes I</ref>–<ref target="frus1964-68v07">VII</ref> of the <ref target="frus1964-68v01">

                        I</ref>–<ref target="frus1964-68v04">IV</ref>, covering 1964–1966, have been
                    published.</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume convey a sense of the dangers and uncertainty in the
                    world situation. Both U.S. and Soviet leaders understood that a general war
                    between the two superpowers could quickly escalate into a destructive nuclear
                    war. In a December 10, 1965, memorandum to the President’s Special Assistant for
                    National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge Bundy</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Spurgeon Keeny</persName> of the National
                    Security Council Staff summarized the latest intelligence on Soviet
                    anti-ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>)-type systems. While
                    noting that there did not seem to be any realistic threat to the United States,
                    he added, “this isn’t to say you shouldn’t still be scared.” (107) Further, a
                    year later, <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Donald Hornig</persName>, the
                    President’s Special Assistant for Science and Technology, sharing his
                    observations with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, the
                    President’s Special Assistant, on a likely Soviet reaction to a U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, commented that “in judging possible
                    Soviet reaction, one cannot underestimate the extent to which they apparently
                    feel themselves ‘under the gun’.” (156)</p>
                <p>The issue of U.S. development and deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system became controversial during the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration. The Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>) were its main promoters,
                    periodically making their case for the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                    system, variously named Nike-Zeus, Nike-X, and Sentinel. (21, 22, 61, 101, 102,
                    104, 105, 152, 153, 155, 160, 161, 163, 165, 190)</p>
                <p>One of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>’s favorite arguments in favor of
                    deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, such as Nike-X, was
                    the fact that the Soviets had apparently already developed one. U.S.
                    intelligence was initially unable to classify the system, named Tallinn and
                    centered around Moscow, as air defense, <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, or
                    dual-purpose. The ambiguity served the Chiefs well, as they cited intelligence
                    estimates and analysis on the system as proof of the Soviet Union’s hostile
                    intent and reasons for the United States to develop Nike-X fully. This early
                    intelligence ambiguity would return to haunt them, however, as more information
                    was gathered about the Tallinn system. The conclusion was that it was a weak and
                    rather ineffective system and posed no major threat to America’s assured
                    destruction capability. (68, 73, 88, 103, 106, 107, 130, 146, 147, 156, 161)</p>
                <p>Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert McNamara</persName>, who
                    was skeptical not only of Nike-X’s efficacy and expense but also its actual
                    deterrence value, staunchly resisted any firm commitment to an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. There was in fact widespread agreement
                    in the U.S. Government that an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would
                    not be capable of fully defending the United States from an all-out Soviet
                    attack. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> argued that saving some lives
                    and affording some protection to the U.S. retaliatory capacity would justify the
                    expense. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> countered that the
                    Soviet Union would only increase its offensive capability enough to overwhelm
                    Nike-X, with the result that the United States would have to spend many more
                    billions of dollars for no real increase in protection. The United States, he
                    argued, should instead depend on the deterrence already provided by American
                    capacity to inflict assured destruction on the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The political objections to the deployment of the Nike-X system were almost equal
                    to the military defense concerns. Protecting only 25 cities would be politically
                    indefensible, and a “thin” system would further leave the administration open to
                    attacks from both those in favor of and opposed to an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. As <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Spurgeon
                        Keeny</persName> observed: “the anti-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                    forces will consider it a foot in the door, and the pro-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> forces would consider it a grossly inadequate system which
                    fails to protect the US population against the Soviet threat.” (198) The
                    difference implied by the terms “thick” and “thin” regarding a Nike-X deployment
                    is misleading. The “thin” system would cover 15 or 25 U.S. cities, while the
                    “thick” system would cover 25 or 50 cities, with overlap among sectors. This
                    limited number of protected cities was one of Nike-X’s greatest domestic
                    shortcomings. While it was predicted the American public would complain about a
                    perceived weakness in the nation’s defense system, residents of the cities and
                    areas not specifically protected by Nike-X would demand protection equal to
                    their counterparts. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued
                    to counsel President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> against
                    Nike-X deployment, telling him that while Congress might “crucify” him for
                    testifying against a full <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, he
                    nevertheless felt deployment was wrong. (167) Further, there were concerns not
                    only about the Soviet reaction, but also Allied reactions. To its critics,
                    Nike-X seemed to be perhaps a clever idea militarily, but politically
                    ill-starred.</p>
                <p>The proponents of Nike-X revealed the strong emotions behind their arguments.
                    General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> pithily espoused
                    strongly negative feelings about the Soviets in a December 6, 1966, meeting when
                    he reminded his colleagues that “we are dealing with the descendants of Genghis
                    Khan. They only understand force.” (150) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> realized that politically a decision rejecting Nike-X
                    would be troublesome for the nation, emotionally as much as rationally.</p>
                <p>While the Soviet threat remained preeminent, as evinced by the number of
                    documents in this volume dedicated to estimates of its offensive and defensive
                    capabilities, retaliatory ability, and weapons development, the Chinese threat
                    also received increased attention. The <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> administration did not wish unintentionally to grant
                    China a higher status militarily simply because of its developing nuclear
                    weapons program, yet it did not want to leave the nation vulnerable to potential
                    attack by the Chinese Communists. While the general consensus was that it would
                    be “suicidal” for the Chinese to launch a nuclear attack on the United States
                    (166), <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and his allies in the
                    national security establishment considered the Nike-X system as a limited
                    defense system primarily against the Chinese threat, not the Russian threat for
                    which it had been conceived as a deterrent.</p>
                <p>The debate on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system also impacted on
                    U.S. arms control policies. Arms control proponents in the administration
                    worried that a U.S. decision to deploy the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                    would fuel a new arms race with the Soviet Union, while deferral of that
                    decision would facilitate the administration’s efforts to reach agreement with
                    the Soviet Union to begin negotiations on the control of offensive and defensive
                    strategic missiles. Additional documentation on the debate on the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> issue and its relationship to arms control is
                    in <ref target="frus1964-68v11">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume XI</ref>, Arms
                    Control and Disarmament, published in 1997.</p>
                <p>Within the administration, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and
                    the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> battled on other strategic weapons
                    programs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> opposed development
                    of an Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (<gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>), instead opting for the FB–111 and retention of some B–52s in the
                    defense inventory. (1, 10, 31) He also vetoed development of a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, preferring to upgrade Minuteman III; of
                    penetration aids for both Minuteman and Poseidon; and of a ballistic missile
                    ship, on the ground that Polaris submarines were much more survivable. He also
                    chose to upgrade the F–106 instead of developing the F–12, a new fighter
                    aircraft, and deferred deployment of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-D, a
                    continental air defense system. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                    also resisted <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> efforts to increase the number
                    of deployed Minuteman missiles (21, 31) and to develop higher-yield nuclear
                    warheads. (25, 28, 29)</p>
                <p>During this time, the SR–71 reconnaissance aircraft was developed, and President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> decided to make its existence
                    public, as well as the U.S. capacity to destroy satellites using nuclear armed
                    missiles. (5, 53) Atlas and Titan <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s were
                    gradually phased out, and the B–52 airborne alert was ended. (109) An extensive
                    study by the President’s Science Advisory Council found the Navy poorly
                    organized, with insufficient capabilities to conduct effective anti-submarine
                    warfare, and steps were taken to improve performance. (99, 124, 201)</p>
                <p>Another complex military-political issue was the U.S. position on chemical and
                    biological weapons. The United States had not signed the 1925 Geneva accord
                    calling for “Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, and Other Gases
                    and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare,” and the administration was facing
                    increasing pressure to define its stance on such weapons. While there was little
                    disagreement over publicly stating a “no-first-use” policy, the question of
                    so-called incapacitating agents, such as riot control gases and defoliation
                    agents being used by American forces in Vietnam, caused debate. Were such agents
                    considered to be chemical and biological weapons? How could the United States
                    claim a no-first-use policy while still using such agents? Such questions were
                    raised both inside and outside the government, providing yet another example
                    where the issue of Vietnam crept into the debate on national security issues.
                    (121, 122, 127, 153, 154, 173, 178, 220)</p>
                <p>Still another sensitive topic for the administration was crisis management.
                    Various departments within the administration were tasked with creating or
                    updating plans for the handling and management of crises. Plans were drafted to
                    improve command and control support for the President, in times of either
                    general or nuclear war, as well as to ensure the survivability of the National
                    Command Authority, i.e., the President and his successors as well as senior
                    officers within executive departments, such as State and Defense. Senior
                    policymakers would eventually decide that the nature of the crisis would dictate
                    not only where the President would go, but whom he would want with him. (62, 64,
                    77, 86, 87, 89, 92, 177)</p>
                <p>Despite initial opposition from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the
                    civilian Defense Department leadership developed plans for a Deep Underground
                    Command Center (<gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss>) in the Washington, DC
                    area. The <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> was presented as an emergency
                    command post, capable of functioning as a war-time government headquarters, much
                    as London’s Cabinet War Rooms had during World War II. This site, however, was
                    to be much larger. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> noted that a 50-man
                        <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> would serve only as a survival
                    facility, as it would be inadequate to house the National Command Authority and
                    the minimum staff needed to support them. The Chiefs argued, however, that a
                    300-man <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> would be inadequate for military
                    purposes. (3) Many were skeptical, not only about the sheer size and feasibility
                    of such a project, but also because the President had the National Emergency
                    Airborne Command Post (<gloss target="#t_NEACP1">NEACP</gloss>) and the National
                    Emergency Command Post Afloat (<gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss>) at his
                    disposal in time of crisis. Some also pointed out that the President might
                    choose to stay in Washington in time of crisis. (77) A further drawback to the
                        <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> plan was the 5 years required to
                    create such a site and make it functional, and the construction cost of $310
                    million. Congress, was skeptical too, and provided only limited funding; by 1966
                    the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> project was virtually dead. (3, 4, 52,
                    92)</p>
                <p>Crisis planning included fine-tuning procedures to be followed for use of nuclear
                    weapons under emergency conditions, particularly where American allies were
                    directly involved. (16, 17, 20, 62, 81, 90, 96, 114, 219) One eventually
                    agreed-upon requirement involved installation of permissive action link (<gloss target="#t_PAL1">PAL</gloss>) devices on nuclear weapons located in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries in Europe, and eventually other
                    areas of U.S. concern. The <gloss target="#t_PAL1">PAL</gloss> device would
                    require some sort of programmed code or card to allow the weapon to release and
                    fire, thus preventing an accidental nuclear incident, and minimizing the dangers
                    of deliberate and harmful weapons crew action. (123, 193)</p>
                <p>While there was no disagreement that U.S. nuclear forces should be capable of
                    assured destruction of the Soviet Union and China, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> took it as a given that the damage-limiting mission
                    (counterforce) should be assured as well. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was not so certain. He first questioned the scale of
                    counterforce needed, and further held that the damage-limiting mission needed to
                    be part of a more balanced program including fallout protection (shelters) and
                        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities. He continued to distance
                    himself from the idea, and by the end of 1968, his successor, <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark Clifford</persName>, was questioning the feasibility
                    of damage limitation entirely, much to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>’s
                    consternation.</p>
                <p>This debate extended also to tactical nuclear weapons, which the Kennedy
                    administration had not resolved. (21) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thought that their use would lead to rapid escalation
                    to general nuclear war, while the State Department detailed studies of their
                    deterrent utility in both Europe and the Far East. Further, the concept of
                    limited war with the Soviets remained unresolved. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> felt that the Soviet Union was unlikely to use tactical nuclear
                    weapons in a limited war (43), and the State Department was concerned that
                    sufficient conventional forces be maintained to reassure the Europeans of the
                    ability to repulse a Soviet attack without resort to nuclear weapons. This
                    debate was subsumed as a more flexible response plan gained widespread
                    acceptance.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> emerges as the dominant figure
                    in many documents in this volume. Far from creating his own policy within the
                    Defense Department, he was keenly aware of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s views, priorities, and public stances, as well as his
                    own role as conduit between the White House and the military establishment. He
                    realized his job was to rein in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the
                    military services, and also to present defense policy to America, thereby
                    serving as a level of insulation for the President, particularly when the
                    decision was not likely to be popular, such as the decisions against a Nike-X
                    deployment. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> remained in close
                    contact with <persName>Johnson</persName>, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Dean Rusk</persName>, and other top policymakers to ensure
                    the appropriateness of Defense Department actions on a world stage involving
                    more than simply military force.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s speech to a United Press
                    International meeting in San Francisco in September 1967 confirmed his central
                    position on national security policy. In his speech he explained the nuclear
                    situation as the United States understood it and announced America’s intentions
                    to develop and refine an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system to defend
                    against Communist China. His speech had been carefully examined and discussed in
                    advance in several parts of the administration, and had been vetted by President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> himself, who was supportive
                    of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s clear outline of American
                    policy. (192)</p>
                <p>Other Kennedy administration preoccupations also continued, notably those
                    involving formulation of a Basic National Security Policy, as well as
                    counter-insurgency. The Basic National Security Policy idea, begun during the
                        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration and which
                    had languished during the Kennedy presidency, resurfaced several times (19), but
                    the resurrections produced nothing concrete. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> felt that while a single document clearly formulating
                    American’s concerns would be “desirable in principle,” it might quickly become
                    so broad as to be meaningless. (75) One attempt to formulate a basic doctrine
                    was <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>’s 1965 paper, “Some
                    Reflections on National Foreign Policy,” which summed up America’s most basic
                    concerns within the global diplomatic scene and concluded with a call for a
                    “clear US sense of direction, quiet leadership, and persistence.” (80)</p>
                <p>The administration also tried to improve the coordination and handling of
                    intelligence. The Net Evaluation Studies Committee (<gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>), which had been created in 1958 to provide “integrated
                    evaluations of the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the event of general war, to inflict direct injury upon the
                    Continental United States and to provide a continual watch for changes which
                    would significantly alter those net capabilities,” was abolished and its
                    functions transferred to the Defense Department. (71, 82) As <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out to
                        <persName>Johnson</persName>, neither the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> nor the Office of the Secretary of Defense had a capability to
                    perform such studies at that time. (72) As chairman of the President’s Foreign
                    Intelligence Advisory Board (<gloss target="#t_PFIAB1">PFIAB</gloss>), General
                        <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> later tried to revive the net
                    evaluation studies, but Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark
                        Clifford</persName> successfully resisted the proposal. (211, 214, 215,
                    218)</p>
                <p>The administration also renamed the Special Group 5412, which had considered
                    covert actions, the 303 Committee. One of the issues the 303 Committee
                    considered was the administration’s response to the public exposure of the
                    covert funding for several well-known institutions, such as the Asia Foundation,
                    the National Student Foundation, and Radio Free Europe. (132, 134, 171, 176,
                    180, 209) The 303 Committee scrambled to find alternative funding for these
                    valued organizations, while minimizing the negative impact the revelations of
                    covert funding provoked. Additional documentation on these intelligence issues
                    will be included in <ref target="frus1964-68v33">

                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> budget priorities would not disappear. The
                    North Korean seizure of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> in January 1968,
                    causing an indefinite temporary deployment of Air Force resources to northeast
                    Asia, confirmed <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concerns that U.S.
                    commitments in Asia severely limited strategic options. (202) The Chiefs noted
                    that B–52 deployments to the western Pacific and Korea meant that there was a
                    200-target degradation from the military’s targeting plans, as set forth in the
                    Single-Integrated Operations Plan (<gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>).
                    Moreover, there were no major army forces ready to reinforce <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> without redeployment from Southeast Asia, or
                    a Reserve callup. Redeployment did not seem likely, however, as President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had told the National
                    Security Council in 1966 that, despite pressure from various “generals” about
                    appropriate actions in Vietnam, he had chosen his course and was “absolutely
                    determined to see it through. No one should be under any illusion that we will
                    be pulling out.” (129) Additional <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concerns
                    centered on the fear that U.S. military forces might be needed for other crises,
                    both international and domestic (such as having to cope with “civil disturbances
                    stemming from racial disorders and anti-draft/anti-Vietnam movements.” (202) The
                        <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposed significant budget increases,
                    but the approaching 1968 Presidential campaign and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s decision not to seek re-election put
                    further action on hold.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the Foreign Relations series include all records needed to provide
                    comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files for these
                    years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, those that the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or
                    are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other
                    Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. <pb n="XII" xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0012"/>The
                    bulk of the foreign policy records at the Johnson Library are in the relevant
                    component parts of the National Security file. Within the National Security
                    file, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Meetings file, the Agency file,
                    and the Subject file proved to be of particular value. The editor also made
                    extensive use of the files of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt W. Rostow</persName> and <persName>Charles
                        E. Johnson</persName>, a member of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    staff with primary responsibility for national security issues. Transcripts of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s telephone
                    conversations, especially with Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, added important depth to the record.</p>
                <p>Second in importance to the White House records at the Johnson Library were the
                    records of the Department of Defense, particularly the records of the
                    Secretaries of Defense, the Assistant Secretaries of Defense for International
                    Affairs, and other major assistants and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Some important documents are found only in the Department of State lot files. The
                    conference files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain briefing
                    materials as well as records of conversations.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides the Department of State historians
                    access to intelligence documents from records in its custody and at the
                    Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, part of the Center for the
                    Study of Intelligence, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.</p>
                <p>All of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of those
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives.</p>

                        <item>At their meeting with the President on 30 December 1963, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff were asked to review and provide their comments on
                            certain recommendations by the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force,
                            concerning a proposed follow-on manned strategic weapon system.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">See <ref target="frus1961-63v08#d154">

                                    Document 154</ref>.</note> Accordingly, the basis for these
                            recommendations is provided below for the consideration of the Joint

                        <item>By the end of 1972, the B–52 will be twenty-one years beyond its
                            design date and the last production B–52 and B–58 will be ten years old.
                            With the passage of time, we have had to rely increasingly on tactics
                            which these aircraft were not designed to employ. Even with the planned
                            modifications to the B–52 fleet these aircraft will be subject to the
                            combined effects of continued structural fatigue and a diminishing
                            capability for effective mission performance in an environment of modern
                            offensive and defensive Soviet weapon systems. If there is further delay
                            in initiating action toward the provision of a suitable replacement
                            capability, there will be no recourse for the nation but to place
                            principal reliance for its security in the 1970s on ballistic missiles.
                            In my judgment, such reliance is both dangerous and militarily
                            unsound.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I am in complete agreement with the need for a modern effective
                            ballistic missile force as an element of our deterrent posture. These
                            weapons provide the quick time to target delivery capability which is
                            essential to underwrite the time urgent nuclear threat targets.
                            Additionally, a secure ballistic missile force, in concert with other
                            survivable strategic forces, provides the strongest possible incentives
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to abstain from attacks on
                            the population centers of the United States, either in an initial attack
                            or as a rational option during conflicts of lower intensity.</item>

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>It is important to recognize, however, that ballistic missile forces
                            represent both the U.S. and Soviet potential for strategic nuclear
                            warfare at the highest, most indiscriminate level, and at a level least
                            susceptible to control. The employment of these weapons in lower level
                            conflict would be likely to escalate the situation, uncontrollably, to
                            an intensity which could be vastly disproportionate to the original
                            aggravation. The use of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and
                                <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s is not, therefore, a rational
                            or credible response to provocations which, although serious, are still
                            less than an immediate threat to national survival. For this reason,
                            among others, I consider that the national security will continue to
                            require the flexibility, responsiveness, and discrimination of manned
                            strategic weapon systems throughout the range of cold, limited, and
                            general war. Specifically, there will be a continuing requirement for: <list>

                                <item>A system that can be used to provide visible evidence, through
                                    increased alert and dispersal and show of force flights, of
                                    national determination as an element of diplomatic maneuver and
                                    negotiating strength in times of international crisis.
                                    Regardless of the size of the force, <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and Polaris missiles have no meaningful
                                    utility for this purpose.</item>

                                    below those which would warrant the employment of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. Manned strategic systems
                                    have a capability for selective and discriminate application of
                                    force which is not provided by ballistic missiles.</item>

                                    approximating actual combat as opposed to ballistic missiles
                                    which must function perfectly the only time they are ever called
                                    upon. In 1963, strategic bombers flew more than 80,000 missions
                                    involving 700,000 flying hours, and the crews performed nearly
                                    150,000 scored bomb runs. With <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s a very small statistical sample will be fired
                                    annually from special test sites which do not correspond to the
                                    operational environment. Further compounding the risk of placing
                                    undue reliance on ballistic missiles is the ever-present
                                    possibility, based on several examples to date, that a single
                                    unanticipated failure may negate or drastically reduce the
                                    capability of the entire force. Last year, for example, all Wing
                                    I Minuteman missiles were determined to be unreliable for a
                                    period due to difficulties with the re-entry vehicle.
                                    Concurrently, all Wing II Minuteman missiles, comprising the
                                    remainder of the force, were considered unreliable by the Atomic
                                    Energy Commission as a result of warhead deficiencies. Finally,
                                    the reliability of the Polaris A–1 fleet, during a period in
                                    1963, was suspect in its entirety due to bonding problems with
                                    the propellant. Although these difficulties all have been
                                    corrected, <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0029"/>they are
                                    indicative of the vulnerability of the total capability to a
                                    single unforeseen system deficiency. Such far reaching effects
                                    have not been encountered with manned systems. Temporary
                                    difficulties may cause restrictions for peacetime flight safety
                                    purposes but they have no immediate repercussions upon our war

                        <item>Throughout the period of the last year, various study groups within
                            the Air Force have analyzed the requirement for a follow-on strategic
                            aircraft. From these efforts, the prescribed characteristics of an
                            improved manned strategic system have evolved. The aircraft would be
                            designed primarily for low level penetration at subsonic speeds but also
                            would be capable of dash speeds in excess of Mach 2.0 at high altitude.
                            The basic armament would consist of internally carried, short range air
                            to surface missiles with variable yield warheads. A reconnaissance
                            subsystem consisting of side-looking radar, infra-red, and photographic
                            sensors also would be integral to this system. This aircraft would have
                            intercontinental range, unrefueled, and would be compatible with the
                            KC–135 tanker for range extension through aerial refueling.</item>

                            125 probably in operation. While this was a lesser number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s than we had, we must always bear in
                            mind that they are very large and carry warheads in the several megaton
                            range and this gives me concern.</item>

                            supplied by the Corona satellite, which has been primarily a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> development.</p>

                            pictures are taken from an altitude of about 100 miles over targets in
                            the Soviet Union and elsewhere when required. The satellites stay in
                            orbit [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        <p>The Corona/Search satellite first returned film from orbit in August
                            1960, and has performed successfully 29 times since then out of 46
                            attempts. It is launched from a Thor-Agena at a total cost of about [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            dollars per shot. The Corona can cover three million square miles per
                            mission in stereo, mowing a two hundred mile wide strip below its
                            trajectory.</p>
                        <p>We are able to blow these film strips up to 40–60 times their original
                            size and produce photographs of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            sites and other critical targets which are truly remarkable. The quality
                            of photographs that we get is especially highly classified.</p>
                        <p>This type of photography provides a major source of raw intelligence data
                            and is one of the most important inputs for our national estimates of
                            Soviet strategic capabilities. So far, we have covered over 100 million
                            square miles of the earth’s surface. 95% of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been filmed to date. In this year alone, we have
                            covered 65% of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and 45% of
                            China. From all of this photographic coverage we have identified some 18

                            surface-to-air missile sites have also been located and reported.</p>
                        <p>We are now looking at ways to improve the present system further and to
                            invent a successor with greatly improved capabilities. In the meantime,
                            we have constructed the National Reconnaissance Plan so as to provide
                            one Corona/Search flight each month indefinitely.</p>

                                    program, planned to establish an effective and survivable system
                                    of command and control facilities, is exemplified best when
                                    viewed in relation to the long-term aspects of the program. The
                                    proposed funding for the Five-Year Program (<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965–69) indicates that
                                    approximately $860 million may be committed to the <gloss target="#t_NMCS1">NMCS</gloss>. The cost estimate for a
                                    300-man <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> is approximately
                                    $310 million which represents over 36 per cent of the total
                                    budget proposed for the <gloss target="#t_NMCS1">NMCS</gloss>.
                                    The $310 million basically provides for only construction costs,
                                    and does not include in-house or entrance communications
                                    equipment or operational support systems essential to the
                                    realization of initial operational capability. If the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> were to be included in the
                                        <gloss target="#t_NMCS1">NMCS</gloss> program, there are
                                    indications that it would absorb in future years considerably

                                    hardened antennas, the probability of survival of <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> communications depends
                                    primarily on redundancy of antennas. Various means of

                        create a limited interdepartmental committee to study the problem from the
                        point of view of the civilian top level of Government; and at the same time
                        suggest to the Secretary of Defense that he request the Joint Chiefs to give
                        their views on the nature of their relations with both the
                        President-Secretary of State-Secretary of Defense level and the CINCs in a
                        crisis situation toward the end of the sixties. The target date for this is
                        the 15th of March.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this would be to get the Chiefs to deal explicitly with their
                        view of the relations between the top civilian level and the operational
                        commanders during the period of crisis, and make clear both their ideas of
                        what kinds of crisis situations they are thinking of and the amount and
                        character of communication they would expect in both directions from and on
                        location.</p>
                    <p>The interdepartmental study group would try to answer four questions, against
                        the background of some likely scenarios of crisis in which a thermo-nuclear

                            are convincing to <persName corresp="#p_BH8">Harold Brown</persName> and
                            me. First, if there is to be a fight with the Congress, the President
                            himself must be convinced of the need for the proposed facility, and
                            this can best be done through the participation of his own staff.
                            Second, there is not within the Pentagon the kind of experience that the

                    <p>Program 437 involves the attainment of an anti-satellite capability based on
                        the employment of [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        worldwide satellite tracking system, provides target satellite position data
                        from which an intercept point is determined. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] In general, the system will have at

                        intercept from Johnston Island any satellite which passes over the United
                        States. The response time of the system is determined by the ability of
                            <gloss target="#t_SPADATS1">SPADATS</gloss> to provide the necessary
                        satellite position prediction data. Presently the system requires
                        approximately 36 hours of tracking to provide sufficiently accurate data.
                        Performance of the <gloss target="#t_SPADATS1">SPADATS</gloss> system is
                        being improved and further evaluated to determine feasible improvements in
                        response time and accuracy.</p>
                    <p>Program 437 is a concurrent effort with the research and development and
                        operational implementation actions occurring simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>The research and development phase, which was funded at $7.9 million in
                        Fiscal Year 1963 and $16.0 million in Fiscal Year 1964, has reached the
                        point of launch demonstration. [<hi rend="italic">9 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] Other than the radio frequency interference problem,
                        all elements of the system have demonstrated a capability to support a
                        successful intercept up to the point of launch. <gloss target="#t_SPADATS1">SPADATS</gloss> has completed five targeting exercises, each time
                        providing sufficiently accurate satellite position predictions within the
                        36-hour system capability.</p>
                    <p>On June 27, 1963, the Secretary of Defense directed that Program 437 achieve
                        a short reaction operational capability by June 1964. Subsequently, the 10th
                        Aerospace Defense Squadron has been activated with duty station at
                        Vandenberg Air Force Base. It is planned that launch teams from this
                        squadron will rotate on temporary duty at Johnston Island, thereby providing
                        a full standby alert capability. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text

                    <p>Required training facilities have been completed at Vandenberg Air Force
                        Base. Necessary technical data is in final stages of preparation. The first
                        launch team has completed individual training and is in crew-training status
                        as of January 13, 1964, with completion programmed for March 1, 1964. An
                        actual launch by this crew is scheduled between completion of the research
                        and development launches and the directed operational date.</p>
                    <p>On December 2, 1963, the Secretary of Defense approved investment
                        expenditures of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        will be required for operations and maintenance. At this point, all actions
                        concerning the operational phase of Program 437 are on schedule, and no
                        significant difficulties in meeting the directed June 1964 date are

                        press coverage of reconnaissance satellites but, with the exception of the

                        significance. We plan to query selected U.S. Embassies in an effort to
                        determine more clearly the level of public and official awareness of the
                        U.S. satellite program and attitudes toward it. If our experience with
                        recent proceedings of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Outer Space
                        Committee is a valid indicator, most non-Bloc states tend to accept space
                        reconnaissance as a fact of life and to view attendant political
                        considerations with indifference. This situation is satisfactory from our
                        standpoint.</p>

                            Reconnaissance Program:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Over the past 18 months we have noted a decline in Soviet press articles and
                        statements on U.S. satellite reconnaissance. The Soviet press regularly
                        reports “secret” launches of U.S. “spy” satellites, but these are only two
                        or three sentence summaries of U.S. press agency stories, usually without
                        Soviet comment. We have seen little else in the Soviet press since last
                        summer on any aspect of reconnaissance satellites, and certainly nothing to
                        compare either with earlier Soviet assaults on such activity or with recent
                        U.S. articles on this subject. There has been no Soviet commentary yet on
                        these U.S. articles adverting to extensive U.S. space reconnaissance
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Outer Space Committee negotiations,
                        the Soviets have relaxed (but not abandoned) their position of long standing
                        on banning reconnaissance satellites, at least to the extent of making
                        agreement possible last fall on general principles of space law, without
                        reference to reconnaissance. It is clear that the Soviets have taken this
                        action without prejudice to future negotiations, but it does represent a
                        significant shift in Soviet tactics.</p>
                    <p>The new Soviet attitude may result in part from experience they have acquired
                        with reconnaissance satellites. In the last year the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has launched a large number of
                        recoverable satellites, some of which carried low resolution cameras. We
                        have intercepted Soviet video transmissions of pictures from these cameras.
                        It is quite possible, given the 10,000 lb. weight of the Soviet Cosmos
                        vehicles, that higher resolution cameras were aboard as well. Khrushchev
                        hinted as much when he told Spaak last summer that the Soviets were
                        photographing the U.S. and even offered to show Spaak some pictures.
                        Adzhubey is reported to have made a similar statement in Finland in
                        September 1963.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the inconclusive evidence we have acquired in the last year
                        or so, we believe that (a) the Soviets are certainly aware of the program,
                        although probably still uncertain of its precise scope and quality; (b) they
                        are prepared for the moment to live with it, in part <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0042"/>because there is no feasible alternative
                        open to them to stop it, and (c) they are probably engaged in a
                        reconnaissance effort of their own. As they acquire first hand experience,
                        their awareness of the strength and weaknesses of space reconnaissance may
                        have some influence on their future proposals in space and disarmament
                        matters.</p>

                    <p>A separable first stage proposal on strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and

                        our Allies and domestically. Until a U.S. position on this matter is fully

                        <p>The United States has developed an observation satellite system which is
                            now able to furnish reasonable quality and reasonably timely photography
                            of any area in the world which may be of interest. This unilateral
                            capability effectively provides the “open skies” coverage of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which was requested by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in 1955 as part of
                            a disarmament agreement. It is clear that possession of this photography
                            changes the requirements for ground or other types of inspection as part
                            of the verification of a number of different proposed arms control

                        <p>Currently the most important single U.S. intelligence asset is satellite
                            photography. Since the first successful recovery of a Keyhole vehicle in
                            August 1960, there have been about 30 recovered missions, providing
                            cloud-free, usable photography of approximately 90 percent of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The quality of the photography has
                            now reached the level, in some instances, of early U–2 photography, and
                            long focal-length camera systems, first successfully used in the summer
                            of 1963, can now provide even better materials on selected targets. With
                            photography from the normal search mode, using the KH–4 camera system,
                            photo-interpreters can detect objects as small as 8 to 10 feet on a
                            side. [<hi rend="italic">8 lines of source text not

                        <p>Satellite photography will be of particular value in the investigation of
                            suspect locations. It is particularly well suited for the identification
                            of new construction activity, for example, and existing photo
                            interpretation procedures include, as a matter of course, the
                            examination of comparative photographic coverage of a given area to
                            detect changes. Tunneling and digging operations, requiring the dumping
                            of spoil, would be readily apparent, for example.</p>
                        <p>The appearance of new transportation nets, even if only a few dirt roads
                            into a relatively inaccessible area, is readily identifiable.</p>
                        <p>For nearly four years photography from earth satellites has been an
                            important source of information on the ground force in the Soviet Union.
                            The extensive high level photography from aircraft (Talent) of military
                            installations and training areas acquired during the period from
                            mid-1956 to mid-1960 is still useful to photo-interpreters for
                            comparison with photography from satellites (Keyhole). Usable Keyhole
                            photography acquired since mid-1960 covers virtually all of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, East Germany, Poland, and Hungary.
                            This photography is good enough to locate and describe military
                            installations including such details as the dimensions, and probable
                            functions of buildings. It can reveal whether installations are
                            currently in use, although the extent of usage at any time cannot be
                            determined. Military training areas, firing ranges, tank moving-target
                            ranges, and vehicle driving courses are easily discerned, and the
                            photography can reveal whether such facilities have been in recent
                            active use. However, it cannot pick up major land combat equipment.
                            Enhanced image resolution offers the hope for sufficient further
                            improvement to eliminate this difficulty. However, there is no certainty
                            that overhead photography can provide a complete and independent
                            confirmation of the existence of a unit or of its strength in manpower
                            and equipment.</p>

                                    United States and the Soviet Union, has already been detected in
                                    photography. The major deterrent to effective use of satellite
                                    photography is likely to be lack of adequate coverage resulting
                                    from weather conditions or long time lapses between photography.
                                    Few areas in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> remain
                                    which have not yet been photographed, and none of these is
                                    readily accessible by existing transportation facilities.
                                    Certain portions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                                    however, provide more information than others. In far northern
                                    latitudes, light conditions generally preclude much usable
                                    photography during winter months. Meteorological conditions also
                                    hamper interpretation in places—the Kamchatka Peninsula and the
                                    Kuriles, for example, are nearly always cloud covered, as is the
                                    Baltic area. On the other hand, desert areas between the Caspian
                                    Sea and Lake Balkhash are nearly always cloud-free.</p>
                                <p>The time between photographic missions covering a given area
                                    varies considerably, depending on the location of the area under
                                    study. Although to date an average of at least one mission per
                                    month has been orbited, the areas covered by each mission vary,
                                    and few areas receive repeated coverage on consecutive missions.
                                    With the added factor of unfavorable cloud conditions, it is
                                    frequently possible that a specific target may not be covered
                                    more frequently than every six to eight months. On the other
                                    hand, some areas located near significant targets, such as
                                        <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites or known <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> facilities, and in desert
                                    areas where cloud conditions are generally good, are covered
                                    nearly every time a satellite is programmed.</p>

                                    control agreement on the cut-off of production of fissionable
                                    material. Installations capable of contributing significantly to
                                    the fissionable material stockpile of any of the nuclear powers
                                    would, of necessity, be sufficiently large and characteristic to
                                    be detectable by all present reconnaissance systems. In fact it
                                    is believed that essentially all of the important elements of
                                    the Soviet AE production complex have been so photographed and
                                    identified. Thus Soviet declarations of production sites could
                                    be confidently checked by satellite photography and decisions
                                    made on the Soviet compliance. A solid basis would be provided
                                    for reaching a decision on inspection to locate an undeclared
                                    facility. Construction of a new AE production facility could
                                    also be detected and probably identified well in advance of
                                    actual operation.</p>

                    <p>Reference (a) recommends approval of an Air Force proposal to reprogram
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 and apportion <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 Air Force funds to initiate a program
                        definition for a follow-on manned strategic aircraft system and to initiate
                        advanced technology on “long-lead-time” development items, including
                        avionics and propulsion, to reduce the time required to achieve an
                        operational capability. This recommendation is derived from two basic
                        considerations: (1) That strategic aircraft in general can be justified on
                        the basis of diversity, flexibility, responsiveness, reliability and the
                        need for timely reconnaissance; and (2) that the B–52/B–58 force will be
                        reaching the end of its effective service life in the early 1970’s.
                        Specifically what is being proposed are budgetary actions, in <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0049"/>advance of programmatic decisions, beyond
                        the funds currently being applied to the over-all program concerning
                        strategic aircraft.</p>
                    <p>The present program relating to strategic aircraft includes: (1) aircraft
                        design studies to further delineate possible characteristics of a new
                        strategic aircraft; and (2) a rather extensive advanced technology program
                        including avionics, propulsion, and sensors.</p>
                    <p>The aircraft design studies will serve as the basis for a specific proposal
                        (or proposals) by the Air Force. The Air Force proposal, when available,
                        will provide something concrete on which to base a decision whether or not
                        to proceed with a Project Definition Phase. It is to be noted that the basic
                        objective of a Project Definition Phase is to provide detailed technical and
                        management data upon which incentive or fixed price contracting can be
                        based. It is not a substitute or supplement to the studies required to
                        establish the basic design and utility of a proposed system.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the program on avionics and propulsion, I would welcome
                        specific suggestions as to what are possible deficiencies and improvements.
                        These suggestions must, of course, be judged on a case-by-case basis in
                        comparison with other claims for resources.</p>
                    <p>In my view, the case has not yet been made that the additional capability
                        that would be provided by an Improved Strategic Aircraft warrants a decision
                        to proceed with the development program recommended by the Air Force. First,
                        the detailed studies by the Air Force have not progressed to the point where
                        detailed aircraft specifications are available. When they are, the potential
                        superiority of the now proposed aircraft can be compared to the B–52. This
                        superiority must be such as to warrant the large expense of replacing the
                        B–52. It is to be noted that the investment in the B–52/B–58 fleet, along
                        with the KC–135, is over $15 billion. Second, I have not been presented with
                        convincing evidence that this fleet will, from the standpoint of air vehicle
                        wear-out, be at the end of its useful service life in the early 1970’s. This
                        question is currently being studied by the Air Force and by my own staff.
                        Third, the Air Force has not yet submitted the information requested in
                        CM–1132–64 dated 16 January 1964, Subject: Requirement for Follow-on Manned
                        Strategic Aircraft.<note n="5" xml:id="d10fn5">A copy is ibid.</note> In
                        that memorandum the Chiefs asked the Air Force to provide an analysis
                        setting forth the reasons why a strategic bomber system is required as a
                        follow-on of the B–52/B–58 systems and why such a bomber system should have
                        the characteristics of the aircraft described in <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 1478/104–1.<note n="6" xml:id="d10fn6">Not found.</note>
                        The Chiefs pointed out that: “Such an analysis should undertake to determine
                        whether any follow-on manned bomber system of attainable characteristics is
                        justified in view of the competing systems in the time period in question,
                        and, if so, <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0050"/>whether the particular
                        system proposed with its specific characteristics is the preferred follow-on
                        system.”</p>
                    <p>I can see no advantage to pre-judging proposals not yet received by now
                        taking budgetary actions beyond those already in force. Certainly it is not
                        necessary to make a decision now on <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65
                        apportionment. As to reprogramming of current year funds, that is possible
                        at any time.</p>
                    <p>I will want the views of the Chiefs on the specific proposals of the Air
                        Force when they are available.</p>

                    <p>Two subjects on which we must reach an agreed policy decision are (a) the
                        surfacing of the Ox and (b) the management of NRO.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the former, I reviewed the “visibility” of the Ox on
                            Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">February 7.</note> I find that Drs.

                            Jackson Maxey, Chief of the Special Projects Staff, Central Intelligence
                            Agency.</note> are agreed that the improved Soviet radar capability
                        makes the Ox visible both to the long range search radar and the radars
                        associated with the surface-to-air missile systems. Therefore it is
                        impossible to fly the Ox over Soviet territory without detection. Originally
                        it was thought—and as recently as 18 months ago—that the Soviet radar would
                        not pick up the Ox. The findings of Dr. <persName>Wheelon</persName>
                        disprove this and this fact bears heavily on the future use of the Ox.</p>
                    <p>If the decision is made by higher authority not to use the Ox for the
                        purposes originally planned—i.e., clandestine surveillance of the Soviet
                        Union—then it must be considered as a “quick reaction” surveillance <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0051"/>asset to be used in times of danger,
                        under circumstances of heightened tension, with the full appreciation of the
                        risks and the provocations.</p>
                    <p>This raises the question of whether in its reconnaissance configuration it
                        should continue as a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> asset or be turned
                        over to the Air Force. This question must be examined carefully and, quite
                        naturally, the use of the Oxcart over non-Soviet denied territory such as
                        Communist China, Southeast Asia and even Cuba should be taken into
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>The above problem is one of the important questions associated with surfacing
                        the Ox—probably<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn4">The word “probably” is inserted
                            by hand, and the words “but is not” are crossed out.</note> the most
                        important long term question from the standpoint of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, our budget, etc.</p>
                    <p>I feel it must at some time be surfaced because of the military versions.
                        Also we are sure to have an accident or forced landing at a public airport,
                        or a “leak”, which will have the effect of surfacing. Timing is of
                        importance as well as method, and these should be studied and an in-house
                        decision reached for guidance in talking with the Secretary of State,
                        Secretary of Defense and Director, NRO and higher authority.</p>
                    <p>The second question is the management of NRO. My last discussion with a
                        representative of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> was with Fubini about
                        three weeks ago at which time he drafted a memo which I felt outlined a very

                        <item>The Soviet Union will increase pressures on the Free World as
                            opportunities present themselves, and will relax pressures when it is to
                            her advantage to do so. Any US or Allied retreats in critical situations
                            will intensify Soviet tactics aimed at achieving advantages, including
                            their inclination to employ force or threats of force. The Chinese
                            Communists will seize every opportunity to undermine US standing; when
                            they judge that circumstances permit, they will supplement political
                            warfare with guerrilla action by indigenous forces as well as by higher
                            intensity military action if they consider that the attendant risks are
                            not too great. Both the Soviet Union and Communist China individually
                            and possibly in concert will continue to instigate and support what they
                            term “wars of liberation” with the aim of weakening the position of the
                            West and establishing communist-oriented governments. Means used to
                            support dissidents will probably range from political and economic
                            assistance to providing military equipment, military training, military
                            advisors, and even cadres. Other communist nations and communist parties
                            in the Free World nations, with the support and encouragement of the
                            Soviet Union, and/or Communist China, will attempt increasingly to
                            embarrass and harass the United States and nations of the Western
                            Alliances. The Soviet and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>

                        <item>Disarmament, nuclear testing and international agreements for the
                            exploitation of space are likely to remain active subjects of
                            international importance. Efforts by the United States to negotiate with
                            the Soviets on disarmament will be continued in an effort to effect some
                            reduction in armaments without jeopardy to US security. Despite any
                            future Soviet willingness to negotiate either an arms agreement or an
                            unlimited nuclear test ban, her basic motive will remain one of
                            subverting the world to international communism. There appears to be
                            little reason to believe that any such agreement can be achieved which
                            will not be predicated on the assumption by the Soviet Union that the
                            Soviet Union and her allies will derive some advantage. Communist
                            China’s eagerness for a voice in world affairs and her unwillingness to
                            abide by international agreements reached without her participation
                            probably will continue to inhibit the effectiveness of any agreement on
                            these subjects.</item>

                        <item>The inclination toward neutralism or relaxed military efforts in many
                            nations may have these effects: (1) create therein a political climate
                            susceptible to communist internal and external influence; (2) weaken
                            Western Alliances; (3) restrain newly emerging nations from adopting
                            pro-Western policies; and (4) discredit US leadership. Individual
                            differences, divergent national objectives, nationalistic drives and
                            personal ambitions of their leaders should prevent the neutralist
                            nations from becoming a cohesive military and political entity.</item>

                        <item>Newly emergent nations will continue to be characterized by
                            nationalism, internal dissension, instability in political and economic
                            institutions, and a tendency to concentrate disproportionately on
                            external affairs in order to assert their independence. Political,
                            military, and economic weaknesses will offer the communists
                            opportunities, at relatively minor risk, for supporting subversive
                            insurgency, political, and economic exploitation, including restrictive
                            trade agreements, and the supply of arms and technicians. It is expected
                            that many new nations will identify themselves with “anti-imperialistic”
                            causes. However, Free World assistance, disenchantment with Soviet forms
                            of assistance, and the political, economic, military and cultural ties
                            between former colonialist powers and their former colonies will tend to
                            counter Bloc efforts. Success of Western efforts to maintain a
                            non-communist alignment among these new nations will depend largely upon
                            the methods and the initiative displayed by Free World nations in
                            combating communist subversion and persuasion. Communist control of a
                            nation, once established, is unlikely to end except through introduction
                            of outside military force.</item>

                            offer some opportunities for exploitation by the Free World. In any
                            event, the Sino-Soviet dispute will continue and will present the Soviet

                            marked by subversion and opportunism. Communist leaders undoubtedly will
                            continue to seek new developments favorable to their <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0057"/>interests in a number of areas, but more
                            especially in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
                            They probably intend to give particular attention to establishing a
                            strong presence in Africa, to stimulating and exploiting leftist and
                            revolutionary movements in Latin America, and to encouraging the growth
                            of a radical anti-American mass movement in Japan and elsewhere as
                            expediency dictates. The communists will use any form of enticement and
                            pressure which they consider advantageous and appropriate to any
                            particular time. These pressures will include political, diplomatic,
                            cultural and economic, as well as propaganda and the threat of military
                            action. The communists will continue to drive aggressively for the
                            control of peoples and areas through subversion and inspiration or
                            capture of insurgent movements. Although the Soviets for propaganda
                            purposes, will label such activity as “wars of liberation,” they will be
                            attempting to bring the non-aligned nations into the communist camp.
                            Above all, however, the Soviets intend to build up their national base
                            of power in the belief that they can improve their over-all power
                            position. They will continue to believe that, as they do so, more
                            opportunities for readily exploitable communist expansion will open up
                            for them. <list>

                                <item>Soviet thinking about military policy is influenced by a
                                    general outlook which asserts that historical forces are moving
                                    inexorably in the direction of communism. In theory, this
                                    movement is carried forward by the struggle of the “masses,” led
                                    by the communist parties, to overthrow the existing
                                    social-economic order during an indeterminate period of
                                    “peaceful coexistence” rather than by the direct use of the
                                    military power of the Soviet Bloc. Soviet leaders see military
                                    power as serving two basic purposes: defense of their system and
                                    support for its expansion. Thus, one of the most important
                                    objectives of Soviet military policy is to deter general war
                                    while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prosecuted its
                                    foreign policies by means short of actual hostilities involving
                                    Soviet forces. Military power is constantly brought into play in
                                    direct support of these policies, through the threats which give
                                    force to Soviet political demands, through the stress on its
                                    growing power which is intended to gain respect for the Soviet
                                    state and its communist system, and through the military aid and
                                    support rendered to allies, friendly but neutral regimes, and
                                    anti-Western movements. Despite a strong Soviet military
                                    posture, the relative strategic balance of forces is in favor of
                                    the West and as long as this condition exists it is doubtful,
                                    except through miscalculation or misadventure, that the Soviets
                                    would initiate general war. There is, however, good evidence
                                    that the Soviets, in recognition of this imbalance, are striving
                                    for weapon systems which could, in the future, enhance their
                                    capabilities relative to the West.</item>

                                <item>The Soviets wish to have the forces to fight wars effectively
                                    should they occur. One of the most important objectives of
                                    Soviet policy is to deter general war. Except for so-called wars
                                    of national liberation, their political outlook, their military
                                    programs of recent years, and intelligence on their current
                                    intentions all suggest that the Soviet leaders do not regard war
                                    as desirable. They realize their deterrent must be credible in
                                    the sense that it rests upon powerful military forces. Moreover,
                                    they recognize that deterrence may fail in some key
                                    confrontation in which, despite their best efforts to retain
                                    control over risks, either they or their opponents come to feel
                                    that vital interests are under challenge. Against this
                                    contingency they wish to have a combination of offensive and

                                    conciliation which would protect the interests of all parties.
                                    The other limit, which puts a check upon this aggressiveness, is
                                    the Soviet leaders’ awareness that their own nation and system
                                    would face destruction in a general nuclear war. Both their
                                    statements and their actions in recent years have demonstrated
                                    their unwillingness to run any considerable risks of this
                                    eventuality. This does not mean, however, that they would always

                                    risk of nuclear war. Barring the development of a decisive
                                    weapon system, the Soviets almost certainly consider that
                                    neither side will deliberately initiate a general war or react
                                    to any crisis in a manner which would gravely risk such a war,

                                    to achieve local gains. They would probably employ Soviet
                                    forces, as necessary, if some Western military action in areas
                                    adjacent to a communist country threatened the integrity of the
                                    Bloc itself. Even in the latter case, however, they would
                                    attempt to use their forces in a way calculated to achieve their
                                    local objectives, to end hostilities rapidly and to control
                                    risks of escalation. At a much lower level, they will almost

                                    “wars of national liberation, or popular uprisings.” Such
                                    internal wars, ranging pro-Soviet or anti-Western forces against
                                    colonial or pro-Western regimes, were declared to be “just” and
                                    deserving of communist support. They were carefully vague,

                                    usher in a new phase of vigorous Soviet incitement of such

                                    This charge is a major component of the Chinese attack upon the
                                    correctness of Soviet policies and, therefore, upon the
                                    legitimacy of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s
                                    traditional leadership of the communist movement. It is also

                            over-all military relationship, in which each side can exert a strong
                            deterrent upon the other, will continue for some time to come. The
                            Soviets do not view this situation as a stalemate, but rather as an
                            opportunity to conduct aggressive maneuvers of many sorts and to
                            undertake a comprehensive effort aimed at attaining a military
                            technological breakthrough. They are clearly determined to maintain and
                            improve their strong military posture. The Soviets are vigorously
                            pursuing programs for research and development in advanced weapons,
                            hoping if possible to create a strategic imbalance favorable to them. It
                            is estimated that these research and development efforts include defense
                            systems against ballistic missiles, the military application of space
                            vehicles and very high yield warheads. It is possible that some future
                            technological breakthrough could lead them to believe that they had
                            acquired a decisive advantage and that they could, therefore, be far
                            more aggressive toward the West. It is not beyond the realm of
                            possibility that, under these circumstances, a decision to initiate a
                            first strike might be made. It is not believed, however, that the
                            Soviets base their policies upon the expectation that they will be able
                            to achieve, within the foreseeable future, a military posture which
                            would make the deliberate initiation of general war a rational decision;
                            the Soviets realize that the West is determined to maintain
                            second-strike capabilities which would inflict intolerable destruction
                            upon them. In any case, their policies rest on the proposition that
                            communist victory can be won without resort to general war.</item>

                            pre-emptively. Such conviction, however, on the part of any country
                            about the intentions of another is extremely unlikely. The Soviet
                            leaders have probably concluded that it would be impossible to count
                            upon incontrovertible advance evidence that the enemy was irrevocably
                            committed to an imminent attack. Moreover, the compulsion to strike
                            first, if the threat of hostile attack is still ambiguous, declines as
                            missile systems become more important and less vulnerable, and if the
                            net military advantage to be derived from a first strike decreases. This
                            trend of Soviet thinking is suggested by assertions that an aggressor
                            cannot neutralize the retaliatory capability of a powerful opponent.
                            Nevertheless, a surprise attack—that is to say, one delivered in a
                            period of no particular tension and after entirely secret military
                            preparations—is the only one which would give the Soviet Union a chance
                            of destroying any significant part of the Western nuclear strike
                            capability before it could be launched. Therefore, in spite of its
                            unlikelihood, it remains a possible, though improbable, course of action
                            for the Soviet Union.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Escalation</hi>. A number of Soviet statements in
                            recent years have expressed the view that limited war involving the
                            major nuclear powers would inevitably escalate into general war. While
                            such statements are intended in part to deter the West from local use of
                            force, this official view also reflects a genuine Soviet fear of the
                            consequences of becoming directly engaged in limited war involving
                            Soviet and US forces. This probably also extends to involvement of
                            Soviet forces with certain Allied forces in highly critical areas,
                            notably Western forces in the European area. Nevertheless, they might
                            employ their own forces to achieve local gains in some area adjacent to
                            Bloc territory if they judged that the West, either because it was
                            deterred by Soviet nuclear power or for some other reason, would not
                            make an effective military response. They would probably employ Soviet
                            forces as necessary if some Western military action threatened the
                            integrity of the Bloc itself. Should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> become directly involved in a limited war with the US
                            or Allied forces, it is believed that the Soviets would not necessarily
                            expand it immediately into general war, but that they would probably
                            employ only that force which they thought necessary to achieve their
                            local objectives. They would also seek to prevent escalation by
                            political means.</item>

                            in defense of its own or satellite borders or, in the absence of

                            support of local revolutions will continue to be Peiping’s primary mode

                            this goal, however. The Chinese at present are probably unable to
                            produce even MIG–17’s entirely by themselves, and it will be a number of
                            years before they can design and produce more advanced types of military
                            aircraft. Indeed they may have chosen instead to concentrate their
                            limited resources on missiles. Their wholly domestic naval shipbuilding
                            capacity is likely to be restricted to surface ships of the smaller

                            policy has always been characterized by caution in undertaking
                            initiatives in the face of superior power. Hence, the decline in the
                            relative effectiveness of its military equipment and weapons is likely
                            further to temper its policy, especially in circumstances where it might
                            confront US armed power or US-equipped Asian air forces. However, the
                            Chinese Communist Army will continue to be the strongest in Asia and
                            will provide a powerful backing for Chinese Communist foreign policy.
                            The Sino-Soviet dispute will probably place additional demands on
                            Chinese military dispositions and capabilities, since one of the
                            consequences of China’s new “independence” from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be the need to keep a closer
                            watch than previously on the long China-Russia border—which the Chinese
                            still consider a “difficult” and “unsettled” question. Her slowly
                            developing nuclear weapon and missile capability will increase an
                            already considerable military advantage over Asian neighbors. However,
                            for the foreseeable future she will not approach the advanced weapons
                            might of the United States or <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            particularly in the field of long-range striking power. For this reason,
                            among others, Peiping would be unlikely to attribute a decisive
                            importance to modern weaponry. They would probably continue to rely
                            primarily on a huge ground force and, unless confident of Soviet
                            support, would try to avoid hostilities which might escalate into
                            nuclear war. Considering the chances of retaliation, it is difficult to
                            conceive of any situation in which Peiping would be likely to initiate
                            the use of nuclear weapons in the next decade or so.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Foreign Policy</hi>. Communist China’s foreign policy
                            objectives can be distinguished roughly by the amount of risk the regime
                            is prepared to take. The obvious first rank objective is the
                            preservation of the regime and the protection of its existing
                            boundaries. For these purposes the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are willing to go to war, almost regardless of the
                            odds. If US or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> troops approached
                            its borders through Laos or North <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0067"/>Vietnam, they would almost certainly be ready to commit their forces
                            openly, unless in the particular circumstances they saw greater
                            advantage in more covert military operations. The acquisition of Taiwan
                            falls in the second rank of objectives—those for which they are fully
                            prepared to use overt military force, but only when the prospects of
                            success are judged to be high. To achieve this goal, they are prepared
                            to run fewer risks and are particularly anxious to avoid direct conflict
                            with the United States. They almost certainly will not attempt to seize
                            by military force either Taiwan or any of the major offshore islands
                            which they believe the United States would help defend. It is not
                            believed that the explosion of a nuclear device, or even the acquisition
                            of a limited nuclear weapons capability, will produce major changes in
                            her foreign policy in the sense that they will adopt a general policy of
                            open military aggression, or even become willing to take significantly
                            greater military risks. China’s leaders recognize that their limited
                            capabilities will not alter the real power balance among the major
                            states and could not do so in the foreseeable future. In particular,
                            they will recognize that they remain unable either to remove or
                            neutralize the United States’ presence in Asia. Nevertheless, the
                            Chinese would feel very much stronger and this mood would doubtless be
                            reflected in their approach to conflicts on their periphery. They would
                            probably feel that the United States would be more reluctant to
                            intervene on the Asian mainland and thus the tone of Chinese policy
                            would probably become more assertive. Further, their possession of
                            nuclear weapons would reinforce their efforts to achieve Asian hegemony
                            through political pressures and the indirect support of local “wars of
                            liberation.”</item>

                            range goal of spreading communism throughout the under-developed world,
                            Communist China is probably not prepared to accept any substantial risk,
                            although it must be noted that it tends to estimate the risks involved
                            in supporting “wars of national liberation” much lower than does Moscow.
                            It apparently does not intend to undertake overt conquests of foreign
                            lands in the name of communism, but intends to let indigenous
                            revolutionaries do the fighting and the “liberating.” The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are prepared to train foreign

                    <p>3. I told the President we had completed an extended Corona coverage of the
                        Soviet Union involving the photographing of about 54% of the Soviet
                        landmass. I explained this was the first time in which we had returned two
                        reels of film from one satellite. This gave me an opportunity to discuss the
                        Corona J development. I said that the photography had not been completely
                        studied but the evidences were that the Soviets were slowing up or stopping
                        construction of soft <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites and were
                        emphasizing the construction of hard sites. I explained that after
                            Penkovsky<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Colonel <persName>Oleg
                                Penkovsky</persName> was a KGB agent who provided U.S. and British
                            intelligence sources with information on Soviet missile forces and
                            technology, among other things, beginning in 1961 until 1963 when the
                            Soviets arrested, tried, and executed him.</note> was apprehended,
                        Khrushchev had stated, and we had learned, that he had told the Presidium
                        that Penkovsky had revealed the location of their missile sites, therefore
                        he had to spend an enormous amount of money—50 billion rubles—to relocate
                        the missiles because we now knew where they were. This was untrue because
                        Penkovsky had not told us the location of a single missile site. However
                        Khrushchev knew that through satellite photography we were learning the
                        exact location of missile sites. He was not relocating them—what he was
                        doing, he was hardening them, and this was costing them an enormous amount
                        of money. The President expressed great interest in the subject of satellite
                        photography and I asked for an hour’s time to go over the program, the
                        pictures and other details. He agreed. I suggested perhaps when he was
                        flying some place I go with him and we could spend an hour or so together on
                        this one subject. This he felt might be a good idea.</p>

                    <p>4. I then discussed the surfacing of the Oxcart and advised him that Chairman
                        Vinson and Senator <persName>Russell</persName> felt that their Committees
                        should be fully informed by them and they wished to do this in advance of
                        the <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0069"/>announcement and also stated that
                        Mr. <persName>Cannon</persName> wished me to meet with his Subcommittee
                        prior to the announcement and that <persName>George Mahon</persName> wished
                        to inform his committee prior to the announcement. I recommended that this
                        be done but it be timed so the Committees would be advised practically
                        concurrently with the announcement so that the press would not get the news
                        before the President announced it. I said that if, for instance, he was to
                        make the announcement Saturday<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">February
                            29.</note> morning (which he did not confirm at the time), then all of
                        the Congressional actions should be taken Saturday morning. Thus the
                        Congressmen would know in advance but not so much in advance that the press
                        would get hold of the story. The President was very much against this. He
                        felt that if the announcement was made on Saturday, we could inform the
                        Committees on Monday. I stated that this would cause the Committee Chairmen
                        and the Committees a great deal of trouble. With this
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> picked up the phone to call Senator
                            <persName>Russell</persName>; however the call was not returned and I
                        did not get a final decision.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <hi rend="italic">Action:</hi> Later I mentioned the question to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> and he said that he
                            would have to get to the President and get a decision. Until this
                            decision is forthcoming we should take absolutely no action with respect
                            to the Hill. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> and I
                            discussed the problem several times during the day, including a brief
                            discussion at Mrs. J.F. Kennedy’s residence when the President was
                            there. However, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName> did not
                            think it appropriate to discuss it with the President on the particular
                            occasion at Mrs. <persName>Kennedy</persName>’s residence. This should
                            be followed up with <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">Bundy</persName>

                        until the President does make an announcement. In the case of European

                        <item>I opened the meeting by explaining briefly the background of the
                            development of the Oxcart, the features which were applicable to
                            military aircraft, contribution the plane would make to supersonic
                            transport and the reasons why it was necessary to surface the
                            development at this time. I explained there was a growing danger that it
                            would surface itself through a leak, accident or forced landing and this
                            would be more awkward <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0072"/>than if we
                            announced it in advance. I avoided any reference to the reconnaissance
                            mission, however, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added very considerable amount of information
                            bearing on the reconnaissance development which brought out some
                            discussion [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] the amount of flying, the number of planes, etc.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> made a point of the
                            fact that a total of over 40 planes, together with the entire
                            development cost of the plane and engine, had been accomplished in a
                            remarkably short time, 4 or 5 years, and at a cost of about $1 and 1/2
                            billion. He compared this to the B–70 on which there has been about $2
                            billion spent and the plane is still not out of the hangar. Both during
                            the meeting and afterwards he spoke with great enthusiasm on the
                            performance of the Agency, Lockheed and other contractors in the
                            development and he expressed a wish that the Department of Defense could
                            perform in the same way. He attributed the performance to people who
                            were doing the job and actually knowing what was going on in detail in
                            the areas of their responsibility.</item>

                            invoke it in departments and also in the White House itself. There was
                            no dissension to the surfacing, although it was known that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> had dissented at the

                        developed in response to the <gloss target="#t_BNSP1">BNSP</gloss> Planning

                    <p>While this document was prepared in consultation with other interested

                        Kennedy Administration, it has not been subjected to formal
                        interdepartmental clearance. I assume that, if formal interdepartmental
                        clearance is desired, you will initiate this. Within the Department,
                        however, the paper has been formally cleared with the appropriate bureaus
                        and consequently officially represents the Department’s organization for
                        internal defense policy and related activities.</p>

                        <p>The thesis of the <gloss target="#t_USOIDP1">USOIDP</gloss> document is
                            that subversive insurgency represents primarily a Communist attempt to
                            retard, exploit and/or gain control of the development process in
                            underdeveloped countries, and that this threat requires an effective
                            response by the threatened <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0077"/>government covering a wide spectrum of political, economic, military,
                            psychological, and other measures. The U.S. role in countering this
                            subversive threat is regarded as ancillary to the local government’s.
                            The way in which the U.S. Government organizes itself to assist in this
                            task in any given situation will normally be a reflection of the degree
                            of U.S. influence and freedom of action the U.S. may enjoy in the
                            country threatened by subversive insurgency.</p>

                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>The functions of the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) are to insure: proper recognition of the
                                    subversive insurgency threat; reflection of such recognition in
                                    training, equipment, and doctrine; marshaling of resources to
                                    deal with the threat, and development of programs aimed at
                                    defeating it. In addition, its purpose is to insure the
                                    development of adequate programs aimed at identifying,
                                    preventing, or defeating subversive insurgency and indirect
                                    aggression in countries and regions specifically assigned to it
                                    by the President, and to resolve any interdepartmental problems
                                    which might impede their implementation.</p>
                                <p>In performing the above functions, the members of the Special
                                    Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) act on behalf of their
                                    respective departments and agencies, and depend for staff
                                    support upon their own staffs, and upon such country, regional,
                                    or functional interdepartmental committees (normally chaired by

                                    Consequently, the Special Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) itself has no permanent organizational
                                    structure except for its Subcommittee on Training. This has the

                                    training conducted by all departments and agencies. Agency
                                    training requirements have been established by National Security

                                    their various “roles and missions” as set forth in “United

                            has been mounted and executed by and large within the framework of
                            existing governmental organization. It is believed that by adhering to
                            the traditional lines of organization and by its determination not to
                            recreate an <gloss target="#t_OCB1">OCB</gloss>-type structure,
                            President Kennedy gave the Foreign Affairs agencies an opportunity to
                            develop a more vigorous response to the problem of Communist subversion
                            and insurgency. To insure this, the Administration created the Special
                            Group (<gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss>) and confined its role
                            primarily to finding the weak spots in our internal defense effort and
                            to spurring governmental action where necessary. On reflection, it
                            appears from this vantage point in time, that the determination of the

                            to thrust the primary responsibility for internal defense policy and
                            programs on the appropriate departments and agencies has proven to be
                            sound.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, it is concluded that the official Washington community has
                            effectively responded to the organizational requirements set forth under
                            the basic National Security Policy Planning Tasks II (E). The present
                            organization for internal defense provides the U.S. Government a far
                            better ability to cope with the growing problem of subversive insurgency
                            today as compared to the general situation prevailing in Washington in
                            early 1961. Although the success or failure of a particular course of
                            action can not be a valid test of whether the organization supporting it
                            is adequate, the ability to develop, plan and initiate programs
                            responding to newly developing problem situations is testimony to
                            effective organization.</p>

                    <p>After a review of the currently approved Instructions for Expenditure of
                        Nuclear Weapons in Emergency Conditions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                        recommended approval of redrafted instructions which are in simplified
                        format and which have been updated to make them editorially compatible with
                        the terminology employed in current plans. A copy of these updated

                            addressed. Section B contains force objectives, deployments, expansion,
                            and selected reserve tables in the normal <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss> format. Section C consists of situational analyses
                            which were designed to assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their

                            and B. Although logistic implications were considered in the situational
                            analyses (see paragraph 5, Section C, Volume II of Part VI), specific
                            logistic guidance will be recommended to you in the Logistic Annex to
                                <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-69 on 1 April 1964. The Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff will provide their views on personnel in conjunction
                            with their comments on your tentative decisions on all programs by 15
                            June 1964, as required by your schedule for Calendar Year 1964. The
                            individual views of the Chief of Staff, US Army, the Chief of Naval
                            Operations, the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, and the Commandant of the
                            Marine Corps are briefly and clearly summarized in the Tables of Section
                            A and footnotes thereto. The rationale associated with these Tables
                            provides additional explanation of these views.</item>

                        <item>The objective force levels herein are considered essential for
                            national security in support of the US military strategy delineated in
                            Parts I through V, <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-69. In
                            considering objective force requirements, <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0084"/>the Joint Chiefs of Staff were agreed in many areas as
                            to the degree to which <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 programmed
                            forces meet our basic military objectives. In other areas, however,
                            there exist major unresolved questions and divergencies regarding forces
                            and weapon systems which are reflected in differences in individual and
                            collective force recommendations. As concerns our general war posture,
                            there is the problem of the optimum balance of offensive and defensive
                            means. In connection with our limited war posture, issues exist
                            concerning: force levels; mix of land, sea, and air capabilities;
                            weaponry to be used; rates of modernization; and the use of tactical
                            nuclear weapons and the degree of reliance to be placed on them. <list>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Strategic Retaliatory Forces</hi>. There is
                                    agreement that the United States should maintain a clear margin
                                    of strategic superiority as a deterrent. A major issue is
                                    whether or not the Minuteman force should be increased above the
                                    programmed level. This issue stems from differing views
                                    concerning relative emphasis as between counterforce,
                                    damage-limiting operations, and assured destruction of the enemy
                                    as a modern industrial society. A related issue concerns
                                    planning factors and the application thereof to translate
                                    differing target lists into delivery system requirements. A
                                    second major issue is whether an advanced manned strategic
                                    aircraft should proceed beyond the program definition phase at
                                    this time.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Continental Air and Missile Defense</hi>. The
                                    Joint Chiefs of Staff are agreed that programmed force levels do
                                    not provide sufficient capability for <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> defense in the mid-range period against the
                                    threat of manned bombers and missiles. They further agree that
                                    the defense should be composed of a balance between active and
                                    passive defense; a balanced air and missile defense, to include
                                    antisubmarine forces; and a proper mix of air defense weapons
                                    systems. There are significant differences with respect to the
                                    balance and mix and the selection of specific air defense
                                    weapons systems. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agree to continue
                                    with the development of the Nike X system, as a matter of
                                    priority. One issue, however, is whether a decision can be taken
                                    now for production and operational deployment, as justified by
                                    research and development progress, or whether final selection of
                                    a system for defense against <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s
                                    should be deferred pending evaluation of further research and
                                    development and completion of the study now underway regarding
                                    the integration of all components affecting the defense of
                                        <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>. They agree that
                                    research to pursue other approaches for missile defense should
                                    also be emphasized and that development of increased capability
                                    against <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s must continue,
                                    both in antisubmarine and antimissile capabilities. A second
                                    issue relates to the <gloss target="#t_IMI1">IMI</gloss>—whether
                                    to proceed with deployment beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 with related phase-down of Century series

                                    <hi rend="italic">General Purpose Forces</hi>. The specific
                                    major issues pertaining to General Purpose Forces center on the
                                    number of Army divisions, the numbers and concept of employment
                                    of attack carriers, concept of employment of Marine Corps
                                    forces, and Air Force tactical aircraft required to carry out
                                    the strategy in the mid-range period. The individual force level
                                    recommendations vary from proposals for significant increases
                                    above the program level to those for substantial reductions.
                                    Underlying these recommendations are the differing views
                                    regarding the levels and mix of forces required to provide, with
                                    an acceptable level of risk, the capability to meet the
                                    estimated requirements of a separate major contingency operation
                                    while maintaining the readiness to reinforce <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. A matter which makes the
                                    problem more complex is the difficulty of forecasting accurately
                                    whether or not it would be advantageous for the United States to
                                    use tactical nuclear weapons and, if so, the relative
                                    effectiveness and timing of their use. The current intensive
                                    study being given these questions should assist in the
                                    continuing evaluation.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Airlift and Sealift Forces</hi>. The Joint
                                    Chiefs of Staff agree that there is a continuing need to improve
                                    our airlift and sealift capability in order to permit the rapid
                                    deployment of our combat forces. An issue in this regard is
                                    whether <gloss target="#t_MSTS1">MSTS</gloss> troopships should
                                    be in active status or are sufficiently responsive when retained
                                    in ready reserve. Fundamentally, the basic problem with respect
                                    to the levels of these forces is the appropriate balance and mix
                                    of sealift and airlift with due consideration being given to
                                    selective pre-positioning of supplies and equipment. Continuing
                                    studies will assist in better understanding of their
                                    relationship.</item>

                        <item>The scenarios used in the situational analyses are illustrative,
                            designed to test alternative degrees and types of response with varying
                            levels of combat and support forces. The conclusions derived are valid
                            to the extent that they provide useful information to the
                            decision-making process. Certain assumptions, which necessarily had to
                            be made, and the concepts and factors used, are critical in the
                            derivation of the forces employed in the postulated situations.
                            Individual comments regarding the limitation and usefulness of the
                            scenarios are included in the footnotes. There are differing views
                            regarding the value of the scenarios for deriving forces. One view holds
                            that the scenarios of Section C, prepared separately from Sections A and
                            B, provided an insufficient and inappropriate basis from which to
                            develop over-all objective force levels. The other view, while
                            recognizing limitations, utilized the situational analyses insofar as
                            practicable as a basis for developing and evaluating the force
                            structures for each program and for quantifying support and logistics
                            requirements.</item>

                        <item>The divergent views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stem primarily from
                            the same issues as those reviewed last year in <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-68,<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">Not found.</note> i.e.,
                            the extent of counterforce targeting in the future, the optimum balance
                            between strategic offensive and defensive systems, uncertainties as to
                            the effect of tactical nuclear operations on the requirements for
                            general purpose forces, and the rate and extent of modernization of all
                            forces. During the past year, these problems were the subject of
                            additional study, and they were given further consideration in the
                            situational analyses, or scenarios, which comprise <ref target="frus1964-68v02">Volumes II</ref>–<ref target="frus1964-68v05">V</ref> of Part VI, <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-69.</item>

                        <item>The scenarios were designed to assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
                            their determination of objective force levels. As indicated in the
                            footnotes throughout the analyses, the Service Chiefs have many
                            reservations concerning the assumptions, factors, concepts of employment
                            and conclusions of these analyses. Nevertheless, in my opinion, they
                            have been a valuable asset in bringing additional light to bear on these
                            major issues which all Services are earnestly endeavoring to

                        <item>After review of the scenario on strategic retaliatory forces, and
                            other studies on this subject during the last year, I am impressed by
                            the uncertainties regarding the value of a more extensive counterforce
                            effort and hence am not convinced as to the need for additional
                            strategic missiles over and above the present program of 1,200
                            Minutemen.</item>

                            <p>a. Although there are many reservations concerning the scenario on
                                continental air and missile defense forces, I am convinced that the
                                force levels now programmed will not provide adequate <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> defense in the mid-range
                                period. In looking forward to that period, we are presently faced
                                with a choice, in my opinion, between (1) primary reliance on
                                strategic offensive forces as a means for effecting deterrence or
                                for limiting damage if deterrence fails (without major improvement
                                of defensive means); and (2) a balance of offensive and improved
                                defensive forces which, while also providing for deterrence, will
                                afford the optimum practicable capability for limiting damage. In
                                view of the greater loss of life and productive capacity shown in
                                war games based upon the first choice, I am convinced that it is the
                                second alternative which we should adopt.</p>
                            <p>b. In order to resolve this issue with understanding, there is an
                                immediate requirement to determine the optimum balance between
                                offensive and defensive systems. Hopefully, the studies now underway
                                in both your office and the Joint Staff will be of assistance in
                                this determination. In the interim, feeling that some requirement
                                will be validated for such programs as Nike X, Phase II <gloss target="#t_SOSUS1">SOSUS</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_IMI1">IMI</gloss>, I recommend proceeding with these
                                programs in such a way as not to delay <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0088"/>their time of availability, but without attempting
                                to establish force objectives at this time. Finalization of the
                                optimum total numbers of the various strategic offensive and
                                defensive systems will require prior determination of the optimum
                                balance among the systems involved.</p>

                            <p>a. With respect to the limited war operations considered in the
                                scenarios, a point of particular interest is that upon the outbreak
                                of major hostilities in Europe, we could not continue operations in
                                Southeast Asia beyond a possible holding action employing about four
                                divisions. If, on the other hand, a decision were made to continue
                                the limited war operations with a force of eight divisions as
                                planned in the Southeast Asia scenario, any buildup in Europe, over
                                and above the five divisions now there, would be limited initially
                                to no more than seven divisions for a total of twelve divisions in
                                Western Europe, and this could only be done by transfer of the two
                                divisions from Korea. Further expansion of the US ground force
                                contribution in Europe would have to await the availability of the
                                six Army ready reserve divisions which could not be made combat
                                ready, deployed and committed to battle until sometime during the
                                period M+120-M+180.</p>
                            <p>b. A second point of importance brought out in the examination of the
                                scenarios is that an apparent imbalance exists between Army combat
                                forces and the associated combat support and logistic support units.
                                These Army support units appear to be the limiting factor in the
                                ability of the United States to respond on the postulated scale and
                                timing to major contingencies.</p>

                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The limited war scenarios also indicate possible deficiencies in
                            logistic support in the form of personnel, supplies and equipment for

                        This policy, based on overriding operational and security considerations,
                        has since 1958 been reaffirmed on several occasions, and remains basic US

                    <p>Danger is that such requirement may offer superficial appeal to certain

                        of, would seek to have us divulge the deployment of our nuclear deterrent,

                        components and seek to embarrass some of our Allies who do not wish to draw
                        attention of their publics to presence of nuclear weapons in their
                        territories.</p>

                    <p>Ceylonese requirement of assurances on nuclear weapons has already been
                        strongly endorsed by TASS News Agency, and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> PriMin Chou En Lai joined with Ceylonese Prime Minister

                        at end of visit to Ceylon in exhorting other states take similar action.</p>
                    <p>There is distinct possibility that Ceylonese requirement may be placed on
                        agenda for Second Non-Aligned Conference in Cairo next September by planning
                        group for conference meeting in Colombo March 23. If expected support for
                        requirement grows, Ceylonese may also later introduce resolution in UNGA
                        calling for adoption by member states in interest halting “spread of nuclear
                        weapons.” However, the Dept has no evidence yet that the Ceylonese have this
                        in mind.</p>
                    <p>Last summer Mexican President Lopez Mateos, in announcing Joint Declaration
                        of five LA states on proposed formation of nuclear free zone, stated that it
                        was Mexican policy to deny national territory for transportation of nuclear
                        weapons (although declaration itself silent on transport of nuclear
                        weapons). GOM, however, is not known to have formalized this policy.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Basis for US Policy</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our policy is based on overriding operational and security considerations. We
                        consider armament of naval ship or aircraft to be an integral part of it and
                        not being “transported” into national territory in sense which Mexico has in
                        mind, or increasing “spread of nuclear weapons” in Ceylonese sense. We
                        cannot accept any requirement that we identify or deny nuclear armament of
                        naval ship or aircraft, for to do so would breach important information
                        regarding extent of our deterrent, and seriously hamper the mobility of the
                        US Forces by dividing them into nuclear and non-nuclear elements. We
                        consider that any conventional <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0093"/>ship
                        or aircraft can be fitted with nuclear weapons and given nuclear delivery
                        capability; and, furthermore, that any ship or aircraft can be “equipped for
                        nuclear warfare” if only to defend itself. We are not prepared give blanket
                        assurance to any government, in order gain approval for port entry of naval
                        ships or landings of military aircraft, that no nuclear weapons are carried
                        or would be carried in the future. We consider that such self-imposed
                        limitation on types of aircraft or ships for which we might wish request
                        port entry or landing right neither realistic or in best interests of
                        US.</p>
                    <p>If any such assurance or requirement is made a precondition of port entry, we
                        would plan to hold the visit in abeyance, leaving original request
                        outstanding until host government in prepared approve visit without
                        reference to any such requirement.</p>
                    <p>In connection with any denuclearized zone which may be established, we would
                        consider it important to reserve our right of transit for all naval ships or
                        aircraft without having to identify those armed with nuclear weapons or
                        having nuclear delivery capability.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have initiated preliminary informal exchange of views in Dept at staff
                        level with Embassy representatives of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                        Canada, Australia and New Zealand on Ceylonese requirement. We are exploring
                        whether it may be possible find some common approach to problem.</p>
                    <p>We have advised <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> informally that we do not
                        believe that their initial approach to problem is either realistic or
                        helpful. British tactic thus far has been to have informal assurances given
                        by Mountbatten to PriMin Bandaranaike that no British ship (he inadvertently
                        omitted aircraft) carrying nuclear weapons would ever visit Ceylon. Although
                        GOC has permitted one British military transport land without giving such
                        assurances, GOC has categorically informed <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                        none will be permitted land in future in absence such assurance in each
                        case. The British HiCom has informed GOC that Mountbatten’s overall
                        assurances were intended to apply to aircraft as well, and are awaiting
                        clarification from GOC whether <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military
                        aircraft will be able land in future based on Mountbatten’s assurances to
                        PriMin Bandaranaike.</p>
                    <p>Canadians have destroyer visiting Ceylon at end of March during planning
                        meetings in Ceylon for Second Non-Aligned Conference. Since approval for
                        Canadian ship visit given prior issuance Ceylonese requirement on nuclear
                        weapons, Canadians have not had to give assurances and do not intend to do
                        so. Neither Australia or New Zealand have any immediate requirement for
                        visits to Ceylon by naval ships or military aircraft. While both governments
                        fear that refusal furnish Ceylonese with information on nuclear weapons they
                        request will <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0094"/>damage their position
                        with non-aligned states, they have indicated interest informally in finding
                        some agreed formula which would be helpful to us.</p>
                    <p>Dept believes it would be unwise at present to initiate any discussions on
                        this subject which would tend to give Ceylonese requirement undue
                        importance. We do not intend to acknowledge circular note informing us of
                        requirement or to seek “clarification” of it as France apparently has done
                        with respect to the meaning of the phrase “equipped for nuclear warfare”. We
                        believe, however, it would be profitable for us to acquaint friendly
                        governments selectively with our position in order to give them basis on
                        which they can decide not adopt Ceylonese requirement. Dept will issue
                        specific instructions in this regard to certain posts once we have received

                    <p>In reply to your memorandum of March 20, 1963, appropriate officers of the
                        Department of State have reviewed the referenced Acting <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> memorandum and the annual <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee report.</p>
                    <p>1. The Department would first like to comment on the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> memorandum of March 12 which in part deals with audio
                        countermeasure activities. The Department’s primary role in the field of
                        audio countermeasures is based on the authority and responsibility of the
                        Department as the major foreign affairs agency of the United States
                        Government. We are strongly opposed to any change of leadership in the audio
                        countermeasure community and we object to relinquishing our role as Chairman
                        of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee or of any
                        resultant new committee that may evolve. The Department of State has been
                        the leader in the U.S. audio countermeasures community since the late 1940’s
                        and continues to hold this position today. The Department’s position of
                        leadership in the audio countermeasures field has been established by the
                        fact that the Office of Security of the Department of State is responsible

                        establishments. The Department of State cannot delegate the authority to
                        guide and coordinate audio countermeasures activities to any other agency in
                        view of the Department’s responsibility for the security of the greatest
                        bulk of penetration target areas.</p>

                    <p>The Department’s position is further supported by having in effect the
                        largest number of trained engineers and technicians in the field supported
                        by a major research and development effort under the guidance of experienced
                        engineers. The present Department of State research and development efforts
                        have been in effect since 1961 and these efforts have been successfully
                        translated into operational countermeasure equipments and techniques. A few
                        specific examples of Department of State accomplishments in this area are
                        the acoustic conference room, the panoramic receiver, the signal recognizer
                        system and standardization of a secure telephone system. Further evidence of
                        the Department’s leadership in the audio countermeasures field is witnessed
                        by the fact that Department of State security engineers have been
                        responsible for over 95 per cent of all U.S. Government “finds”, including
                        six additional microphones and one transmitter discovery since the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee report of August,

                    <p>For the same reason [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        any audio countermeasures body in view of the Department’s primary role in
                        this field.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Sections 7(c) and 7(d) of the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>

                    <p>The question of coordination of “sweeps” or technical inspections as stated
                        in the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> memorandum does not exist.
                        Clear-cut areas of responsibility for the security of our overseas military
                        and diplomatic missions have been long established. The Office of Security
                        of the Department of State is clearly responsible for the over-all security
                        of all U.S. diplomatic representation and has provided security services to
                        all tenant agencies operating within U.S. diplomatic missions abroad.
                        Security within U.S. military installations is clearly a military
                        responsibility and conflict between military and the Department of State
                        interests does not exist. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not

                    <p>The Department of State feels that the coordination of countermeasures
                        equipment requirements are best resolved directly in the committee
                        responsible for the coordination of research and development efforts as
                        provided for in the present <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special
                        Committee. A division of the operational elements from the research and
                        development elements of any countermeasures body can serve only to delay
                        translation of these requirements into tangible results. This condition
                        characterizes the confusion and lack of progress of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee during the initial period
                        of its formation.</p>
                    <p>It is the Department’s opinion, therefore, that the proposal for a new
                        technical subcommittee to coordinate inspection schedules and stimulate
                        requirements has little foundation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Department of State is in favor of coordinating countermeasure
                        development, equipment and procedure requirements and believes the present
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee on Technical
                        Surveillance Countermeasures has made significant progress in this regard
                        within the last three years. The impetus gained by this Committee in
                        translating these requirements into realistic development objects is, in the
                        opinion of the Department of State, a direct result of (a) the growing
                        awareness of all member agencies of the need for close cooperation in
                        establishing policy and program guidelines, and (b) technically competent
                        and experienced leadership of the Special Committee by the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State recognizes the need for expansion of basic and
                        applied research within the countermeasures field and for greater
                        coordination of this research among the member agencies. The inability of
                        the present <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee to achieve
                        greater progress can be attributed to (1) its lack of member representation
                        of a sufficiently high level of individual authority and technical
                        competence and (2) the unavailability of information concerning current U.S.
                        advances in positive audio surveillance equipment and techniques. The offer
                        by the Acting <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> of cooperation in regard
                        to this latter impeding factor is warmly accepted.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State can see no need for the proposed transfer of the
                        present Special Committee from the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to
                        the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>. Analysis of the Special
                        Committee’s structure has not revealed any deficiencies in this body that
                        can be attributed to its relationship with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. However, if such a transfer is determined as being in the
                        best interests of the United States, the Department of State feels that any
                        audio countermeasures body established under the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> should occupy full committee status. The importance of the
                        efforts of any body concerned with the problem of audio surveillance
                        countermeasures, in view of known existing threats, is of far too major a
                        magnitude to be relegated to subcommittee status.</p>
                    <p>2. We concur with the recommendations contained in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Special Committee report of August 14,
                        1963. These recommendations have in fact been enacted during the past three
                        years by the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State feels that the Special Committee’s report is both
                        timely and comprehensive in view of present day threats against the security
                        of the U.S. Government. However, the Department considers the list of
                        recommendations generated by the Special Committee lacking in one major
                        respect. Specifically, there is needed a recognition of and an appropriate
                        recommendation for action on the present lack of cooperation and exchange of
                        information between the positive Intelligence and the Counter Surveillance
                        Communities.</p>

                        two [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        compatible with dual carriage in the B–52. There is [<hi rend="italic">less

                        effectiveness between [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        we should not develop a high yield warhead for present missiles. The
                        additional expense is not justified by the increase in the capability of

                        also recommends that we should continue to conduct a vigorous program of

                        Strategic Retaliatory Forces, December 6, 1963,<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">For text, see <ref target="frus1961-63v08#d151">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, vol. VIII,
                                Document 151</ref>.</note> I believe that our Strategic Retaliatory
                        Force requirements should be based on two objectives: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>“Assured Destruction.” An essential test of the adequacy of our
                                posture is the assured capability to destroy the Soviet [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                                after absorbing a well planned and executed Soviet surprise attack.
                                The purpose of such a capability is to give us a high degree of
                                confidence that, even under conditions extremely favorable to the
                                Soviets, we can deter a calculated deliberate nuclear attack.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>“Damage Limiting.” Beyond the force required to meet the test of
                                “Assured Destruction” additional forces may be justified for
                                counter-force targeting if they could reduce the damage to the U.S.
                                in the event of a Soviet attack by an amount sufficient to justify
                                their added costs.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I do not believe that there can be any reasonable doubt about the adequacy of
                        our forces to achieve the first objective. As I showed in last <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0111"/>December’s Memorandum to the President,
                        referred to above, the approved 1969 Strategic Retaliatory Forces including
                        1000 Minutemen could be expected to be able to destroy about [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] in a second
                        strike after a surprise attack. Even under extremely favorable assumptions
                        from the Soviet viewpoint, which now seem even more unlikely than they did
                        last December, these forces could destroy about [<hi rend="italic">1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>]. Therefore, I believe that the
                        adequacy of our forces, with 1000 Minutemen rather than 1200 for “Assured
                        Destruction” has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
                    <p>As for additional Strategic Retaliatory Forces for the “Damage Limiting”
                        objective, it is clear that they must be considered in relation to our other
                        programs intended for the same purpose, e.g., Continental Air and Missile
                        Defenses and Civil Defense. Moreover, to the extent that we buy additional
                        Strategic Retaliatory Forces for “Damage Limiting”, they should be justified
                        as part of a balanced program, that is, a program that maximizes the number
                        of lives saved for the amount of money spent. There are several studies
                        under way now in the Department that are examining this matter, including: <list>

                            necessary full fallout shelter program is still uncertain.</item>

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Moreover, even if we were to go ahead with a full fallout shelter
                            program and deployment of Nike-X beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966, it has not been established that additional
                            Minuteman <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s would form a part of a
                            balanced damage limiting program.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Furthermore, even if it were established that additional Minutemen
                            were a part of a balanced program that included full fallout protection
                            and a Nike-X deployment, these missiles must be time-phased to match the
                            availability of other damage limiting forces.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Finally, because of the Minuteman II retrofit program, we will be
                            continuing production of Minuteman missiles. Therefore, if a larger
                            force is required at a later date, we retain the option to buy it with
                            no loss in lead time or production re-start costs.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Therefore, I request that the Air Force submit a <gloss target="#t_PCP1">PCP</gloss> which levels off the Minuteman force at 1000 missiles. I
                        recognize that the previously approved retrofit schedule was designed on the
                        basis of a 1200 rather than a 1000 missile force objective and that
                        therefore, in all probability, it should be modified. I would like the Air
                        Force to reconsider the deployment of Minuteman II in light of this change
                        and to recommend one that is consistent with achieving the ultimate force
                        objective economically.</p>
                    <p>The previously approved decisions on spare missiles, missile motor shelf
                        life, extended survivability of Wings I and II are unaffected. In addition,
                        missile-away indicator, radio-launch overlay, improved launch enable system,
                        time-on-target and squadron status reporting subsystems approved for <gloss target="#t_RDTE1">RDT&amp;E</gloss>, production, and retrofit into Wings
                        I–V will be implemented. Initiation of the retrofit of the Minuteman II
                        system could become necessary in the 1972–1973 period because of the shelf
                        life of the system. Studies should continue determining the best follow-on
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Last year the Air Force proposed the siting of a squadron in a location which
                        would allow peacetime launches under conditions as near as possible to
                        operational reality. A possible location was the Hunter Liggett reservation
                        north of Vandenberg AF Base. The basis for the proposal was to provide
                        actual operational tests of missile, launcher, control systems, human
                        factors, and technical data. It also would provide a control sample from
                        which to determine bias in test launches and control system, and anomalies
                        introduced by and during shipment of missiles from operational sites to
                        Vandenberg missile range. If the Air Force still recommends such a plan, I
                        request that its Minuteman <gloss target="#t_PCP1">PCP</gloss> include this
                        siting as an alternative to the basic plan that would not include isolated
                        siting, together with a cost comparison and an evaluation of its cost and
                        effectiveness in relation to such alternatives as an additional flight at
                        Vandenberg AF Base.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend no change in the B–52 force structure
                        through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0113"/>1970. The phase-down of this force
                        beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 was contingent upon the
                        phase-in of an Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft proposed by the Air
                        Force.</p>
                    <p>The issue of the force level is related to the structural integrity of the
                        B–52. Last year the Air Force proposed a comprehensive modification program
                        to correct all known faults of the B–52. At that time, I approved the
                        program for all B–52s except the “B” series. Recently my staff with the
                        cooperation of the Air Force and other agencies has completed a review of
                        the structural problems. It now appears that additional modifications will
                        have to be undertaken to assure the integrity of this force into the
                        ′70’s.</p>
                    <p>I have requested that the Secretary of the Air Force provide me with
                        alternative bomber force levels, their effectiveness over the planning
                        period, and the associated costs and schedules for the modification program
                        necessary to sustain these alternatives. These studies will provide a basis
                        for a decision at a later date.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff show in their proposed force a faster attrition in
                        the B–58 force beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. Unless
                        there are compelling reasons to show that the quantities of command support
                        aircraft available cannot support the recommended quantities, no change
                        should be made. If a change is required, I request that the Air Force submit
                        an appropriate <gloss target="#t_PCP1">PCP</gloss>.</p>

                        and pylons, engines, etc., are required only to support peacetime training

                    <p>With respect to a follow-on aircraft, the Chiefs of Staff, less the Chief of

                        review of the program definition phase. The Chief of Staff, Air Force,

                    <p>I support the view of the majority that the decision on the development and

                        should be submitted. However, I believe that a decision on deployment would

                        <hi rend="italic">Atlas D, E and Titan I</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I understand that the Air Force has given serious consideration to the early
                        phase-out of Atlas D and E, and Titan I. I agree that such a plan merits
                        careful attention and request that the Air Force submit a <gloss target="#t_PCP1">PCP</gloss> which phases out these missiles by end
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965 and Atlas F by end <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968.</p>
                    <p>The Atlas D is configured in a soft, three missile complex and has a slow
                        reaction time. The first missile cannot be launched until fifteen minutes
                        after an execution order; the second missile not before eight minutes later;
                        and the third missile after still eight minutes later. The Atlas E,
                        configured one missile per site, is hardened only to 25 psi and has a
                        reaction time of fifteen minutes. The Titan I is configured three missiles
                        per complex. Theoretically, it is hardened to between 150–200 psi, but the
                        great complexity of the system makes its actual survival potential very
                        uncertain and most probably lower. Moreover, the reaction time of Titan I is
                        also slow—the first missile fifteen minutes after an execution order; the
                        second missile eleven minutes later; and the third missile eleven minutes
                        later, a full 37 minutes later, a full 37 minutes after the order to fire is
                        given. The survival probability of these missiles has been estimated by the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to be very low. Since large
                        quantities of Minuteman missiles will be in the inventory, it seems
                        appropriate to phase out these complex and unsatisfactory first generation
                        systems in order to realize cost savings that can be applied to more
                        effective systems. Studies should be initiated which examine the possibility
                        of using the fully hardened silos for other missile systems.</p>
                    <p>Atlas F procurement beyond <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 is no
                        longer required since Atlas E missiles can be converted into Atlas F
                        missiles with very little modification. In addition, Atlas E assets could
                        also be used for other space booster requirements. Atlas F and Titan II
                        follow-on operational reliability tests are reduced to six firings each per
                        year, as opposed to 12 firings previously approved, bringing the proportion
                        of missiles expended into line with the Minuteman and Polaris test
                        programs.</p>

                        <item>Khrushchev on Reconnaissance Satellites</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Twice in two weeks Khrushchev has raised the subject of satellite
                        reconnaissance in conversations with Americans—Drew Pearson and Senator
                            <persName>Benton</persName>. The Soviet Premier probably has two things
                        in mind. First and most immediate, to maximize pressure on the US to cease
                        overflights of Cuba; second, over time to gain acceptance for the idea that
                        satellite reconnaissance obviates the need for extensive disarmament
                        controls.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Cuban Overflights</hi>. In both the Pearson and Benton
                        conversations Khrushchev raised the subject of satellite reconnaissance in
                        the context of threatening to shoot down a U–2. As Khrushchev described
                        them, the flights were not only increasingly dangerous but unnecessary, a
                        point similar to Castro’s May Day argument that the U–2 flights were
                        unnecessary because the US had reconnaissance satellites.</p>
                    <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0116"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Argument Against Disarmament Controls</hi>. Although the
                        current emphasis is on Cuba, the idea that satellites obviate the need for
                        disarmament controls appears to have been in Khrushchev’s mind longer. On
                        July 8, 1963 Khrushchev raised the subject in a conversation with Belgian
                        Foreign Minister Spaak, arguing that satellites made aerial inspection
                        unnecessary for a European arms control system. Since then the argument has
                        been taken up by lower-ranking Soviet officials, for example by Viktor
                        Karpov of the Soviet Embassy here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Legitimacy of Satellite Reconnaissance.</hi> Like
                        Khrushchev’s May 1960 suggestion in Paris that he would not have objected to
                        US use of a satellite instead of a U–2, Khrushchev’s statements to Spaak,
                        Pearson, and Benton all suggest that Moscow is seeking to legitimize
                        satellite reconnaissance.</p>
                    <p>The degree of Soviet acceptance to date of satellite reconnaissance should
                        not be overstressed, however. For example, in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Outer Space Committee the Soviets have been willing to
                        forego discussion of the subject but they have not made explicit statements
                        accepting the practice. Moreover, the Soviet media have not published
                        Khrushchev’s remarks, Adzhubei’s boast in Helsinki last September about
                        Soviet pictures of New York and Castro’s May Day statement. Moscow is also
                        apparently reluctant to suggest to the home audience that the Soviet Union
                        is vulnerable to American surveillance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Next Moves.</hi> Khrushchev’s semi-public references to
                        reconnaissance satellites could reflect his intention to pursue more formal
                        discussions in this field. He could formally put to the US the proposition
                        on Cuba he has put informally to Pearson and Benton. More broadly, he could
                        seek to inject new momentum into old disarmament debates by formally
                        proposing use of satellites instead of traditional forms of inspection.</p>
                    <p>For the moment, however, we would expect Khrushchev to continue his
                        semi-public remarks to foreigners: they avoid formally accepting US
                        satellite programs as legitimate while showing Khrushchev as seeking a way
                        out of a crisis over Cuba. At the same time they permit him to make threats
                        about the Cuban overflights without putting them formally on the record. He
                        may be calculating that he can with his present tactics maneuver the US into
                        a position where it must choose between three relatively awkward alternative
                        responses: (1) it could remain silent and appear adamant in face of his
                        “reasonable” suggestion; (2) it could agree with his arguments and stop the
                        U–2s; or (3) it could counter his simple proposition with a complex
                        technical, and possibly revealing, argument about the limitations of
                        satellite photography.</p>
                    <p>If Khrushchev finds that his tactics backfire—i.e. that the US welcomes his
                        acceptance of the legitimacy of satellite photography but continues flying
                        the U–2s—it would become more likely that he would make a formal, high-level
                        approach to us to get us to substitute satellites for U–2s.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I recently submitted to The President a report about the progress that has
                        been made on the Supply-Requirements Study for Nuclear War and
                        Reconstruction that is currently being carried out by the Office of
                        Emergency Planning in cooperation with a number of Federal agencies,

                        On June 4, 1964, the Honorable <persName>Walter Jenkins</persName>, Special

                        kept advised periodically of your progress,” and added that “Because of the
                        obvious need for nuclear war objectives to provide guidance for stockpile
                        policy, the participating Federal agencies should give high priority to this
                        work.” A copy of Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>’ memorandum is

                    <p>The Department of State, under guidance issued by the Office of Emergency
                        Planning, is contributing to this study through the development of estimates
                        covering the supply of and requirements for various major resources
                        following a nuclear attack on the United States. The study was explained at
                        a special meeting of the Interdepartmental Emergency Planning Committee on
                        October 1, 1963.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        Since that date, all departments and agencies having either resource or
                        claimant responsibilities for specific materials, products, or services
                        during emergency periods have been conducting detailed evaluations in their
                        assigned areas.</p>
                    <p>The results of the study will be invaluable in our planning for the

                        needs of a conventional war. We are currently being urged, both by members
                        of the Congress and representatives of industry, to develop stockpile
                        objectives which will meet the needs of nuclear war and reconstruction.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>A Soviet military reconnaissance satellite program appears to be well under
                        way with possibly as many as 12 flights since 1962. The program uses
                        recoverable vehicles launched from Tyuratam under the mantle of the Cosmos
                        series. The camera system, providing an estimated resolution between 10 and
                        30 feet, probably is carried in the 10,400-pound Vostok vehicle. The program
                        is expensive, possibly costing as much as 500 to 700 million dollars so far,
                        and places added demands on resources available for Soviet space programs. A
                        requirement for precise targeting information on US targets, not obtainable
                        through other collection means, seems to be the primary reason for the
                        program. Also, Soviet collection of other military intelligence on the US
                        could be usefully supplemented by satellite photography. Khrushchev’s open
                        acknowledgments of the program have been aimed at stopping U–2 flights over
                        Cuba, but also imply a desire for a tacit understanding on reconnaissance
                        satellites. The existence of the Soviet program tends to reduce the
                        likelihood of a Soviet attempt to attack a US satellite.</p>

                        <item>We have concluded that the Soviet military reconnaissance satellite
                            program may have involved as many as 12 flights since 1962. The evidence
                            is convincing that these were military reconnaissance satellites, <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0119"/>although they may have had
                            additional missions. Their launch times and orbits were ideally suited
                            for reconnaissance coverage of the US during daylight hours, the payload
                            was recovered, they were earth oriented and stabilized within the
                            requirements of a sophisticated camera system, and telemetry from them
                            reflected payload activity like that of a reconnaissance photographic
                            payload.</item>

                            Tyuratam between 26 April 1962 and 10 June 1964 leads us to believe that
                            four of them were military reconnaissance satellites, eight others
                            probably were, and four probably were not.</item>

                            reconnaissance photography with the limited data now available. On the
                            basis of what we know about Soviet optical competence and film
                            technology and the operational characteristics of these satellites, we
                            estimate that the camera system could provide resolution between 10 and
                            30 feet. Telemetry from some of the Cosmos satellites suggests that they
                            employed three framing cameras plus an indexing camera.</item>

                            that different types of vehicles were being launched from two different
                            rangeheads, Kapustin Yar and Tyuratam, and the characteristics of the 14
                            satellites successfully orbited from Kapustin Yar rule out a

                            examined are believed to have used the basic 10,400-pound Vostok
                            vehicle, with the possible exception of Cosmos 22 and 30. All were
                            recovered in the Soviet Union three to ten days after launching. The
                            most recent in the series, Cosmos 32, had an inclination of 51 degrees
                            to the equator, while all previous Tyuratam Cosmos satellites had
                            inclinations of 65 degrees. This change suggests that the Soviets are
                            improving their reconnaissance program because the inclination of Cosmos
                            32 permitted greater coverage of the US each day.</item>

                        <item>The series launched from Tyuratam may have had other missions in
                            addition to photographic reconnaissance. The presence of a small
                            radiation package aboard most vehicles is one example of such a
                            secondary mission. Four meteorological satellites in the series
                            transmitted cloud pictures from orbit but this photography was not of
                            military reconnaissance quality. Two of these could also have provided
                            geodetic mapping data. Other research work probably is involved, such as
                            development of lunar and planetary mapping.</item>

                                    applied. The way in which the four mechanisms observed on Cosmos
                                    20 functioned was consistent with the operation of a small
                                    indexing camera and three higher resolution cameras. (see Figure

                            launched from Tyuratam have a reconnaissance mission, it would seem that
                            Moscow is devoting a substantial share of its space effort to the
                            collection of military intelligence. According to preliminary estimates
                            based on the costs of US scientific satellites, the cost of Tyuratam
                            Cosmos operations to date may have amounted to the equivalent of about
                            700 million to one billion dollars, roughly 20 percent of total
                            expenditures estimated for all observed Soviet space programs. As a
                            rough proportion of this estimate, the costs of a military
                            reconnaissance program including the 12 satellites launched so far would
                            be on the order of 500 to 700 million dollars.</item>

                            Strategic missile systems require precise information on the geodetic

                            hundreds of targets in the US is only obtainable by satellite
                            photography. The resolution we estimate the Soviets can achieve—10 to 30
                            feet—would be sufficient to obtain such targeting information when

                            develop a limited capability at an early date so as to be able to
                            retaliate if the US should interfere with a Soviet satellite. In our
                            view, however, the existence of a Soviet reconnaissance satellite
                            program tends to reduce the likelihood of a Soviet attempt to destroy or
                            neutralize a US satellite.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>With more warning of my departure from the arena of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff,<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> was appointed Ambassador to Vietnam on July

                        unfinished business which I must leave behind. Given the circumstances of my
                        reassignment, I have been unable to complete or even expedite work in many
                        of the important areas where I had hoped to make a contribution during my
                        terminal years of military service. The purpose of this letter is to note
                        and comment upon some (but clearly not all) of the important issues which
                        are still unresolved.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">a. The effectiveness of the Joint Staff.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In spite of the many able and dedicated officers who serve on the Joint
                        Staff, I leave it with a feeling that it is still marginally effective. It
                        continues to be hampered by an uneven and sometimes excessively heavy
                        workload, by cramped working conditions, and by inadequate <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0124"/>recognition of its members by their Service
                        of origin. While some progress has been made in giving greater incisiveness
                        to Joint Staff papers and in preserving the integrity of the Joint Staff
                        input from distortion by Service views, there is still an inherent slowness
                        in the Joint Staff operations which often affects adversely the timeliness
                        of the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and thus dulls their impact. An
                        excessive concern over Service representation among the incumbents of the
                        various key posts is another factor which works against continuity of
                        assignment and flexibility in the use of Joint Staff personnel. Finally, the
                        Services are still not putting their best people on the Joint Staff—not
                        always. These factors in combination work against its effectiveness and
                        require correction. J–1 has this whole field presently under study and will,
                        I hope, come forward soon with constructive suggestions.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">b. Proportionate distribution of assignments by
                            Service.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I mentioned the disadvantage of the current practice of distributing
                        important jobs in the Joint Staff rigidly by service. I am opposed to this
                        practice in principle in filling any and all important posts within the
                        Department of Defense. While we should follow the general policy of roughly
                        proportionate Service sharing of participation in the important functions of
                        the Department, we should not accept a strait-jacket policy which prevents
                        choosing the best man for the job regardless of Service. I would favor
                        calling for nominations from all Services to fill all important positions
                        and then endeavor to pick the best qualified man from among the nominees. In
                        the long run, I do not believe this practice would work against an adequate
                        and fair representation of all the Services in the key billets within the
                        Department of Defense.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">c. The readiness of contingency plans.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In working on the Cuba and Southeast Asia plans, I have been impressed by the
                        incompleteness of our past contingency planning. With the exception of these
                        two plans which have lately received a great deal of special attention, our
                        other contingency plans are little more than outlines which could not be
                        expanded for implementation other than on a “crash” basis without months of
                        additional staff work both in the field and in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As
                        I leave the Joint Staff, it is not yet clear whether <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s 32 series can be supported
                        without considerable mobilization and within an acceptable time frame. Once
                        these <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> plans are put in order,
                        the same kind of treatment should be accorded all of the contingency plans
                        which have a reasonable possibility of implementation.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">d. Inadequacy of Army support units.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>From this examination of contingency plans, it is becoming quite clear that
                        the force structure of the Army is out of balance. There are <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0125"/>insufficient support type units to permit
                        the deployment of the combat forces as they become ready for commitment to
                        action. The implementation of virtually any contingency plan will require
                        some mobilization, if not to meet the needs of the immediate contingency
                        then to replace units deployed from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>
                        reserves. There are three alternatives open to us; either (a) to increase
                        the size of the regular Army to permit the formation of the missing support
                        units, or (b) to reduce the combat structure to a proper balance with the
                        existing support structure, or (c) to accept the fact that partial
                        mobilization will be indispensable in any contingency situation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>A further byproduct of the study of contingency plans is a growing
                        recognition of the need for rational logistic guidance to assure the combat
                        readiness of the forces required to execute the approved strategy. We should
                        re-read paragraph 40, Part IV, <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>-69,<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">See <ref target="#d12">Document 12</ref>. Part IV is not printed.</note> and decide
                        whether or not we really mean the language contained therein. If we do, we
                        should then formulate the logistic guidance which will permit the creation,
                        maintenance, and combat support of the general purpose forces described
                        therein. General Meyer has considerable work in progress directed toward
                        this end. He needs full support to carry it forward to completion.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>I regret to report that the relations between the Army and Air Force in
                        Washington have not improved—indeed, I believe that they are worse than when
                        I arrived on my present tour of duty. We are paying the price today of
                        unsound and incomplete decisions and uncoordinated doctrine developed over
                        past years. The immediate need is for the approval of a statement
                        differentiating between organic Army aviation and that Air Force aviation
                        provided in support of the Army. I have made a recommendation to you on this
                        subject with which you are familiar. The second requirement is to make clear
                        that sustained land combat is the primary function of the Army to which the
                        Air Force is in a supporting relationship. The Army commanders responsible
                        for conducting sustained land combat must always have available under their
                        operational control that indispensable element of air power necessary for
                        the success of the land battle. If necessary, the attachment of Air <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0126"/>Force units should be made without
                        hesitation. If such procedures are not adopted, I would consider an overhaul
                        of the statement of roles and missions to be indispensable.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">h. Review of roles and missions.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>With regard to the possible requirement for a review of roles and missions, I
                        would point out that the last statement of roles and missions was effected
                        in 1947 and was based largely upon the capabilities of the Services at that
                        time. Since then, there have been many changes in weapons, in warfare, and
                        in the capabilities of the Services so that a review would appear to be
                        timely. When it takes place, specific consideration should be given to the
                        desirability and feasibility of the following adjustments of roles and
                        missions: <list>

                    <p>During my service as Chairman, I have worked to the best of my ability to
                        attenuate or, if possible, to eliminate the differences—sometimes real,
                        sometimes imaginary—between the civilian and military authorities in the
                        Department of Defense. I hope that our own personal relationship of which I
                        have been very proud has set an example for those around us and has
                        contributed to proper team play. Inevitably, however, there are areas of
                        potential friction where there is an overlap or gray zone of common interest
                        between subordinate elements of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. Insofar
                        as the business of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is concerned, it
                        is the Comptroller’s office and <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> which by

                        likely to impinge upon the responsibilities of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                        While informal discussions have tended in the past to remove most of the
                        abrasive corners, there are still potential difficulties arising from the
                        fatal attraction which some of our civilians find in military planning. To
                        cite a recent example, I suggest a look at DEF 975264 to Vientiane.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">Not found.</note> I feel that it is very important

                        military planning and are not a rival source of military advice in
                        competition with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                    <p>In closing, let me say what a pleasure it has been to have been associated
                        with you in the last year and nine months. In my former unhappy days as
                        Chief of Staff of the Army, I cried out for a decisive Secretary of Defense
                        to end the unending conflicts. I got one and am now content. If you will
                        only stay with your present job and not allow yourself to be diverted to
                        other tasks, I have no concern over the soundness of the future policies and
                        programs of the Department of Defense.</p>

                    <p>Accordingly, the President approved a total of [<hi rend="italic">number not

                        warhead elements) as the stockpile composition for the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966. The President also approved a total of

                        elements) as the adjusted stockpile composition for the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965. This will mean a planned production by

                    <p>The President has authorized the Department of Defense, in coordination with
                        the Atomic Energy Commission, to make such minor changes (plus or minus10%)

                        because of adjusted delivery system assets or changes in strategic,
                        tactical, air defense or anti-submarine warfare concepts. The President
                        directed that any changes indicative of a major shift in defense policy or
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> production capability will be
                        submitted to him for his approval.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to the submission of the Proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 Nuclear Weapon Stockpile decisions were made within the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> which would affect some of the
                        pegpoints set forth therein. These decisions should now be confirmed and
                        appropriate adjustments made to the pegpoints under the authority granted by
                        the President. The adjusted pegpoints are identified in the inclosure<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">Entitled “Adjusted Weapons Overbuild for Quality

                                        alert. The other five aircrews on federal active duty are in
                                        a crew rest status. The aircrews of the squadron which are
                                        not on federal active duty cannot participate in nuclear air
                                        defense operations under present arrangements until they
                                        have been federalized and the squadron has been notified of
                                        the federalization.</item>

                                <p>The time required for federalization of National Guard air
                                    defense units has not been specifically war gamed or tested. The
                                    Joint Staff has estimated that it could be accomplished quickly,
                                    within six to ten minutes after receipt of <gloss target="#t_BMEWS1">BMEWS</gloss> warning. However, there is
                                    no assurance that federalization will be accomplished on this
                                    time schedule or even within the estimated 15 minute period of
                                    time between receipt of warning and missile impact. If
                                    federalization were not accomplished prior to arrival of weapons
                                    on <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> targets, conditions
                                    subsequent to the attack might preclude federalization for a

                    <p>2. I then reviewed orally the results of recent satellite reconnaissance
                        photography and advised the President that what we were seeing was a dynamic
                        developmental program in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, which had
                        brought three new missiles into being in the last two years. We did not know
                        what the three missiles were for but we believed that they could deliver <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0133"/>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] warheads. This did not seem to
                        explain this very expensive program satisfactorily to me. They might be
                        experimenting with multiple warheads, each of which would have its own
                        guidance. If they were successful with such a development it might possibly
                        redress the present balance of numbers. I said we saw continued expansion of
                        nuclear materials production and no cutbacks. Some of the expansion did not
                        seem to be associated with earlier policy decisions and hence I questioned
                        the veracity of Khrushchev’s statements concerning the cutback. I said he
                        may shut down two reactors, but they would be obsolete designs and new
                        reactors were under construction.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of items 3 and 4.]</p>
                    <p>5. I asked the President if he was receiving satisfactory intelligence
                        reports and he said, yes he was very satisfied. I said I would like the
                        opportunity to sit down with him occasionally to exchange views on matters
                        of importance to him, that he had in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        the most competent group of intelligence experts and analysts that existed
                        anywhere in the world and that he was not getting the full benefit of their
                        views and judgments through the written word. I said that any time that his
                        calendar would permit and he was so disposed, I would like to discuss
                        personally with him any problems of interest to him which were within our
                        competence. I took this occasion to tell the President that in my experience
                        in many departments in government and in industry I had never encountered as
                        high level of competence or intellectual capability as I found in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>

                            7–28, the preliminary phase of it taking place Sept. 7–20, in which the
                            situation is developed. This exercise, which is a command post exercise
                            involving senior government officials, somewhat coincides with a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> exercise called Fallex 64 and a

                            which precipitate action and consultation on our part; and finally on
                            Sept. 24 the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and the
                            Secretary of State displace to the National Military Command Post afloat
                            which will be just off Annapolis.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff requested that the President participate with them,
                        leaving the White House by helicopter about 8 a.m. and arriving at Annapolis
                        at 8:20, returning to the White House no later than noon. They want his
                        participation because it will give him a chance to supervise the command and
                        control functions that would be used in an emergency.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would like to do anything the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        wanted him to do but that they must think about this in the atmosphere of
                        the campaign, that there are aspects of this, in spite of the public
                        relations preparation for it, that could be misinterpreted.</p>
                    <p>On the international scene, he also pointed out that it could precipitate a
                        certain amount of uneasiness and even drastic action unless it were very
                        carefully explained that this is a normal exercise which is held regularly
                            <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0135"/>and that other Presidents have
                        participated in similar ones. The President made it clear that even in spite
                        of their best public relations efforts, certain people would draw certain
                        conclusions that would not be beneficial.</p>
                    <p>The President directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to give this careful
                        consideration, outline the public relations approach they would choose and
                        consult with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,
                        then come back to him with a further recommendation.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed out that there
                        could be some positive results from this participation in that people would
                        know that in spite of the preoccupation with the campaign, the President was
                        still vitally concerned with his obligations as President and
                        Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                    <p>The President directed General <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>
                        to mention this to Mr. <persName>Valenti</persName> and if possible to make
                        sure that this was programmed into the President’s schedule on that date so
                        that if he finally decided to do it we will be available.</p>

                    <p>On the initiative of the State Department, the “<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> Working Group” since early June has been
                        developing recommendations for future courses of action in light of probable
                        Soviet knowledge of and attitude toward photographic satellite
                        reconnaissance and our long-range policy objectives relating to the best
                        exploitation of our satellite reconnaissance capabilities.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Two memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis

                    <p>Among various courses of action discussed was the early briefing of the North
                        Atlantic Council on the U.S. and Soviet satellite reconnaissance programs.
                        It is fair to say that most of the working group favored this course of
                        action and the result was a draft briefing document that appeared to satisfy
                        all the members of the group (although the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives made it clear that they could not guarantee
                        a favorable response from the Director).</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to the last meeting of the group Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> that he could not, for security reasons, agree to a
                        briefing of the North Atlantic Council and indicated his intention of
                        personally briefing the heads of State in October as an alternative to the
                            <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> briefing. His proposed briefing
                        reportedly is much less complete than the proposed draft for <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and contains little that has not appeared
                        in the press.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> informed
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>’s position and found that the
                        Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                        reportedly for “political reasons” that the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> should not be briefed at this time.</p>
                    <p>The specific reasons behind Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>’s and the Secretary’s position are not clear and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KSMJ1">Spurg Keeny</persName> and I are of the
                        opinion that the decision on this matter should be reviewed by the President
                        because of its extremely important foreign policy and domestic political
                        implications.</p>
                    <p>For your background, here are some of the pertinent considerations that
                        prompted <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> to initiate
                        this exercise in the first place: <list>

                                has been steadily increasing. Last December Howard Simons printed a
                                feature article in the Post that compromised the general capability
                                although, of course, the extent to which we use the capability and
                                how refined it is is still highly secret and closely protected by
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Other publications have

                                with the possibility that the Soviets may be pushing the question to
                                attack the need for aerial reconnaissance of Cuba.</item>

                                exploiting the capability to our national advantage without

                            <item>The U.S. capability has been basic in the thinking underlying our
                                principal arms control and disarmament proposals. Certain of these
                                proposals would not be advanced or negotiated unless we could depend
                                on the continued existence of satellite reconnaissance. If our
                                disarmament policies become subject to partisan political attack, it
                                might be difficult to defend them without revealing the assurances
                                we gain from satellite reconnaissance in the absence of other
                                satisfactory inspection arrangements. Similarly, satellite
                                reconnaissance underlies much of our military planning for the
                                defense of Europe and the deployment of U.S. forces in connection
                                therewith. This also might enter into the political debates over the

                                been an integrated presentation concerning our reconnaissance
                                program, indicating how extensive it is, something of its technique,
                                a comparison with the Soviet observation program, specific analysis
                                of satellites in relation to Cuba, and the relationship of
                                reconnaissance satellites to military defense and arms control and
                                disarmament programs. The working group felt that such an integrated
                                briefing was needed to bring our Allies up to date and to provide
                                them with an organized body of information instead of the bits and
                                pieces they now have. It would also be an interim step in the
                                ultimate releasing of increasing amounts of knowledge concerning the
                                U.S. program—since many on the working group feel that disclosure
                                will be inevitable in any case and therefore it should be planned
                                rather than capricious or accidental.</item>

                                    military power will remain a constant threat. The Asian

                                    attendant risks are acceptable, they will supplement political
                                    warfare with organized and externally directed and supported

                                    what they term “wars of liberation,” with the aim of weakening
                                    the position of the West and establishing communist-oriented
                                    governments. Means used to support dissidents will probably
                                    range from political and economic assistance to providing
                                    military equipment, training, and advisors. Other communist
                                    nations and communist parties in the Free World nations, with
                                    the support and encouragement of the Soviet Union and/or
                                    Communist China, will attempt increasingly to embarrass and

                                    continue their advocacy of general and complete disarmament, but
                                    basic differences continue to block any substantive agreement.
                                    Disarmament conferences, along the lines of the current Eighteen
                                    Nation Disarmament Conference, will in all probability continue.
                                    Recognizing that agreement on a comprehensive general and
                                    complete disarmament treaty cannot be achieved in the
                                    foreseeable future, both East and West are expected to continue
                                    to seek agreement on separable, more limited measures following
                                    the precedent established by the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the
                                    “Hot Line” Agreement, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    resolution prohibiting the orbiting of weapons of mass
                                    destruction in space. A major bar to the adoption of substantive
                                    proposals has been the unwillingness of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to agree to adequate
                                    verification measures necessitating inspection on or over Soviet
                                    territory. There is little possibility that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s position on verification
                                    will make possible major disarmament agreements during the
                                    period of this plan. A basic objective of Soviet disarmament
                                    policy has been, and is expected to continue to be, elimination
                                    of the nuclear threat at the outset of disarmament without
                                    materially reducing the preponderant conventional capability of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. As long as the
                                    Soviets hold to this position, any substantive disarmament
                                    agreement would be possible only at the expense of United States
                                    nuclear superiority. Unilateral measures coincident with
                                    fulfillment of military requirements or budgetary considerations
                                    are expected to be announced by both sides from time to time for
                                    their political impact as steps toward peace, and in the hope
                                    that the announcement will stimulate a similar response by the
                                    other side. Such measures might include shut-down of fissionable
                                    material production, destruction of obsolescent equipment, and
                                    total or selected cessation of weapon system production. Each
                                    side may seek propaganda advantages by selecting measures which
                                    the other side will find politically difficult or undesirable to
                                    implement. The pace, nature, and scope of arms control and
                                    disarmament measures during the period will be dependent largely

                                    burden of armaments, concern over stability of the world balance

                                    undertake tacit agreements resulting in some degree of arms

                                <item>During the period of this plan the neutralists will fall into
                                    different degrees of neutrality and on many issues will tend to
                                    have conflicting positions among themselves. Nevertheless, the
                                    aggregate effect of neutralism favors the communists because the
                                    latent fear of the aggressive policies of the communist nations
                                    leads neutralists to condone communist actions which they would
                                    condemn in the West. It is probable that the period will be
                                    marked by an intense East-West struggle to attain degrees of
                                    influence over the neutralists. Thus neutralism frequently will
                                    prolong existing tensions or create new ones. If the present
                                    trend toward neutralism of some nations which are currently
                                    Western oriented is not reversed, it will become so strong that
                                    during the period of this plan it may draw nations away from the
                                    West. This development might come about through revolutions in
                                    countries such as Iran or South Vietnam with seizure of power by
                                    neutralist forces, through decisions by existing regimes in
                                    quest of the supposed benefits of neutralism, or through loss of
                                    confidence in the ability and/or willingness of the United
                                    States to support them and safeguard their sovereignties. The
                                    neutralist posture of some of these countries may produce
                                    serious security problems for the United States. Aside from the
                                    possibility of their withdrawing from Western alliances and of
                                    their efforts to balance Western with Soviet or Chinese
                                    influence, there will be continual pressures imposed on the
                                    United States for economic aid and political support;
                                    denunciations of colonialism; concessions on disarmament; and
                                    withdrawal from positions of predominance or influence. Pure
                                    neutralism, as a principle, is fundamentally incompatible with
                                    the Soviet objective of complete world domination. Nevertheless,
                                    neutralism will provide the communists with greater
                                    opportunities for penetration and subversion. Particularly in
                                    the new states, the communists will energetically foster
                                    neutralist leanings and seize upon rivalries among nations and
                                    tribes, upon the need for economic and technical aid, and upon
                                    the naivete and weaknesses of inexperienced leaders. They will
                                    thus increasingly attempt to capitalize on the fact that when a
                                    previously pro-West nation becomes neutralist, it symbolizes a
                                    defeat for the West. This provides the communists with more
                                    direct opportunities to subject these neutralist nations to new
                                    pressures and inducements.</item>

                                    that by 1976 at least half of these leaders will have
                                    disappeared from the world scene, and others may no longer be

                                    the patterns of governmental authority. Thus, the departure or
                                    fall from power of these leaders may be marked by internal
                                    struggles for power, adjustments in national objectives and

                                    concentrate disproportionately on external affairs to assert
                                    their independence and bid for world status. Political,
                                    military, social, and economic vulnerabilities will offer the
                                    communists opportunities, at relatively minor risk, for
                                    supporting subversive insurgency, for political, psychological
                                    and economic exploitation, including restrictive trade
                                    agreements, and for the supply of arms and technicians. It is
                                    expected that many new nations will identify themselves with
                                    revolutionary and “anti-imperialistic” causes. However, Free
                                    World assistance, disenchantment with Soviet and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> forms of assistance, and

                                    counter communist efforts. Success of Western efforts to prevent
                                    a communist alignment among these new nations will depend
                                    largely upon the methods, resoluteness, and initiative displayed
                                    by Free World nations in combating communist subversion and
                                    persuasion. Full communist control of a nation, once
                                    established, is unlikely to end except through introduction of

                                    tractability in the attempt to gain advantage. They will

                                <item>The international communist movement as a whole is likely to
                                    be characterized by increased dispersion of authority and by
                                    more independent conduct by various parties. Although Soviet
                                    power remains a major factor in Eastern Europe, further
                                    manifestations of autonomous and nationalist behavior will
                                    probably occur. Among world-wide communist parties a trend
                                    toward regionalism is foreseen in the Far East, and perhaps in
                                    Western Europe and Latin America. The Sino-Soviet competition
                                    for influence will in some cases lead to further splits within
                                    individual parties. At the same time the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China will
                                    remain powerful sources of material support for their respective
                                    followers, and will retain considerable operational influence.
                                    For the noncommunist world this situation offers important
                                    advantages and some dangers. The assertion of divergent national
                                    interests by communist powers offers an opportunity for the West
                                    to deal profitably with some of them individually. The
                                    Sino-Soviet conflict increasingly is absorbing the energies of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China
                                    and diverting them from sharp contentions with the major Western
                                    powers. Among the non-governing communist parties, a few have
                                    already suffered severe setbacks as a result of the conflict. On
                                    the other hand, some communist parties will become more
                                    effective and will gain greater freedom of action and
                                    respectability because of their more independent status. While
                                    in some countries the parties will tend to lose their rationale
                                    and elan, in others they will probably emerge as more formidable
                                    revolutionary organizations, though more national than
                                    international in character. Regardless of internal quarrels,
                                    Communists will retain an underlying enmity toward the West if
                                    only because their convictions are in so many respects
                                    incompatible with traditional Western concepts of political and

                                    Critics of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will be

                                    Alliance. New national leaders will undoubtedly emerge, perhaps
                                    bringing new policies and proposals. Future developments within
                                    the Common Market (EEC) will have implications for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Such questions as

                                    which will present complex problems within the Alliance. France
                                    can be expected to continue to press forward her concepts of

                                    suggest the development of European policies less responsive to
                                    US leadership. Similarly, there may be criticisms or agitation

                                    opportunism. Soviet and Chinese Communist leaders undoubtedly
                                    will continue to seek, instigate and support new developments
                                    favorable to their interests, particularly in Africa, Latin
                                    America, SE Asia, and the Middle East. Both Communist China and
                                    the Soviet Union will continue to compete in establishing a
                                    strong influence in Africa, in stimulating and exploiting
                                    leftist and revolutionary movements in Latin America, and in
                                    encouraging the growth of a radical anti-American mass movement
                                    in Japan and elsewhere as expediency dictates. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China will use
                                    forms of enticement and pressure which they consider

                                    propaganda and the threat of military action. Both the Soviets
                                    and the Chinese Communists will continue to drive aggressively
                                    for the control of peoples and areas through subversion and

                                            certainly continue to occur in Latin America throughout
                                            the period. For the most part, based on the assumption
                                            of continued US support, the area will almost certainly
                                            remain US-oriented, although in the face of internal and
                                            external communist pressures, some nations can be
                                            expected to adopt an increasingly independent position.
                                            In addition to the already established Cuban communist
                                            government, the coming to power of a communist

                                            republics during this time frame is possible. In this

                                            economy have recently reached an acute stage. Over-all
                                            growth is lagging, various sectors of the economy are
                                            intensifying competition for scarce resources,
                                            agricultural production is falling far short of needs,
                                            large wheat purchases in 1963 have greatly aggravated
                                            the hard-currency deficit, and gold stocks are nearing a
                                            critically low level. This situation is due in part to
                                            chronic Soviet mismanagement, but mainly to the burdens
                                            imposed on the economy by a series of programs too
                                            ambitious for available resources. The demands of
                                            defense and space have greatly encumbered economic
                                            growth since 1958. Recently, industry has been adversely
                                            affected, as well as agriculture and the production of

                                        <item>Soviet leaders have now launched a new effort to cope
                                            with their most intractable economic problem—the
                                            stagnation of agriculture—through a large expansion of
                                            the chemical industry, especially for the production of
                                            fertilizer. They apparently expect to finance this
                                            program from the expansion they anticipate in the
                                            economy, from cutbacks in some non-defense programs, and
                                            from large and long-term Western credits. But it is also

                                        <item>Soviet thinking about military policy is influenced by
                                            a general outlook which asserts that historical forces
                                            are moving inexorably in the direction of communism.
                                            Soviet leaders see military power as serving two basic
                                            purposes: defense of their system and support for its
                                            expansion. Thus, one of the most important objectives of
                                            Soviet military policy is to deter general war while the
                                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> prosecutes its
                                            foreign policies by means short of actual hostilities
                                            involving Soviet forces. Military power is constantly
                                            brought into play in direct support of these policies,
                                            through the threats which give force to Soviet political
                                            demands, through the stress on its growing power which
                                            is intended to gain <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0153"/>respect for the Soviet state and its
                                            communist system, and through the military aid and
                                            support rendered to allies, friendly but neutral
                                            regimes, and anti-Western movements. As long as the
                                            relative strategic balance of forces is in favor of the
                                            West, it is highly unlikely except through
                                            miscalculation or misadventure, that the Soviets would
                                            initiate general war. There is, however, good evidence
                                            that the Soviets, in recognition of this imbalance, are
                                            striving to enhance their capabilities relative to the
                                            West.</item>

                                            effectively should they occur. Except for so-called
                                            “wars of national liberation,” their political outlook,
                                            their military programs of recent years, and
                                            intelligence on their current intentions all suggest
                                            that the Soviet leaders do not regard war as desirable.
                                            They realize their deterrent must be credible in the
                                            sense that it rests upon powerful military forces.
                                            Moreover, they recognize that deterrence may fail in
                                            some key confrontation in which, despite their best
                                            efforts to retain control over risks, either they or
                                            their opponents come to feel that vital interests are
                                            under challenge. Against this contingency they wish to
                                            have a combination of offensive and defensive
                                            capabilities which will enable them to seize the

                                            logically they must think that a deliberate Western
                                            attack on them is improbable, they appear to have

                                            domination is assured, and to the view that power—in its

                                            priority objective as constantly trying to change the
                                            East-West balance of power and the world conception of
                                            that balance in their favor. To this end they
                                            persistently endeavor to enhance the components of their
                                            economic, military, and scientific strength and no less
                                            important, their political position in the world arena.
                                            Soviet boasts of military prowess and superiority over
                                            the West are designed to back up their political
                                            initiatives by exploiting present and future Soviet
                                            power potential. At the same time, the Soviets do what
                                            they can to undermine and denigrate the power of the

                                            defines one limit of Soviet foreign policy; so long as
                                            it persists, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                            will regard international issues as opportunities
                                            progressively to weaken and undermine its opponents, and
                                            not as occasions for conciliation which would protect
                                            the interests of all parties. The other limit, which
                                            puts a check upon this aggressiveness, is the Soviet
                                            leaders’ awareness that their own nation and system
                                            would face destruction in a general <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0154"/>nuclear war. Both their
                                            statements and their actions in recent years have
                                            demonstrated their unwillingness to run any considerable
                                            risks of this eventuality. This does not mean, however,
                                            that they would always estimate the risks correctly, nor
                                            does it mean that they would abandon interests they
                                            considered vital in order to avoid grave risk of nuclear
                                            war. Barring the development of a decisive weapon
                                            system, the Soviets almost certainly consider that
                                            neither side will deliberately initiate a general war or
                                            react to any crisis in a manner which would gravely risk
                                            such a war, unless vital interests were considered to be

                                        <item>It is believed that the Soviets are unlikely as a
                                            matter of general policy, to assume the military and
                                            political risks involved in using their own forces in
                                            overt military operations to achieve local gains. They
                                            would probably employ Soviet forces, as necessary, if
                                            some Western military action in areas adjacent to a
                                            communist country threatened the integrity of the Soviet
                                            Bloc itself. Even in the latter case, however, they
                                            would attempt to use their forces in a way calculated to
                                            achieve their local objectives, to end hostilities
                                            rapidly and to control risks of escalation. At a much
                                            lower level, they will almost certainly encourage and
                                            support the use of force by pro-communist forces when
                                            they believe that a local situation is ripe for forceful
                                            exploitation and that the challenge to Western interests
                                            is not direct enough to involve uncontrollable risks of
                                            a direct encounter between United States and Soviet
                                            forces.</item>

                                        <item>This estimate of Soviet views on general and local war
                                            is generally consistent with their officially announced
                                            positions. They also distinguish a category of “Wars of
                                            national liberation, or popular uprisings.” They are
                                            carefully vague, however, in discussing the forms their
                                            support would take, and in particular, have neither

                                            qualitative improvement will be emphasized; it is
                                            believed that the Soviets will introduce follow-on
                                            systems characterized by better accuracy, larger
                                            payloads, better reliability, and easier handling and
                                            maintenance. It is believed that they will also attempt
                                            to improve survivability by deploying a greater
                                            proportion of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in hard sites, by providing their
                                            submarines with the recently developed submerged launch
                                            ballistic missiles which have longer range than their
                                            present surface launched missiles and by increasing the
                                            readiness of their strategic forces. If current
                                            estimates are correct, it would appear that the Soviets
                                            would not be able during the period of this plan to
                                            pursue successfully a strategy of attacking US nuclear
                                            striking forces prior to launch to such an extent that
                                            damage inflicted by US retaliatory strikes could be
                                            considered acceptable, but they will have a force
                                            capable of attacking major US cities and a portion of US
                                            nuclear delivery forces or, alternatively, of varying
                                            the relative weight of effort on these two target
                                            systems. Similarly, the Soviet Union probably would have
                                            a significant capability for retaliation even after an
                                            initial US attack. It is believed that Soviet strategic
                                            attack forces intended for Eurasian operations are
                                            nearing planned levels. The large missile forces
                                            deployed primarily against Europe will probably remain
                                            at about their present size, but survivability will be
                                            enhanced through hardening and possibly by the
                                            introduction of ground mobile systems. The medium bomber
                                            force will probably decline in size over the next
                                            several years, but capabilities will probably improve
                                            with the continued introduction of supersonic aircraft.
                                            Thus, the Soviets will maintain massive forces for
                                            strategic attack in Eurasia and will improve these
                                            forces.</item>

                                            great concern for the period of this estimate. The
                                            massive defenses deployed over the past several years
                                            provide a measure of the Soviets’ concern with this
                                            problem, and evidence indicates that the Soviets are
                                            continuing to strengthen these defenses. The total
                                            number of interceptor aircraft will probably decline,
                                            but a larger percentage of the remaining force will be
                                            all-weather types. Deployment of the SA–3 for
                                            low-altitude defense probably will continue in order to
                                            supplement the existing medium and high altitude
                                            defenses around the more important targets and astride
                                            what the Soviets consider to be the more likely
                                            peripheral penetration routes. It is possible that more
                                            attention will be given to sheltering the civil
                                            population from fallout, but in view of construction
                                            needs in the economy, it is doubted that a large-scale
                                            shelter program will be undertaken. The Soviets might
                                            hope through development and deployment of an
                                            antimissile system to offset US strategic <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0156"/>superiority to some
                                            extent. The available evidence leads to the conclusion
                                            that the Soviets have not yet been successful in
                                            developing effective and reliable systems for defense
                                            against strategic missiles. It is believed that the
                                            Soviets would not regard as acceptable for wide-scale
                                            deployment any <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                                            system that does not have continuous readiness and an
                                            almost instantaneous reaction time together with a very
                                            high level of accuracy, reliability, and discrimination.
                                            Considering the effort devoted to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> development, it is
                                            possible, though by no means certain, that the Soviets
                                            will achieve such a system within the period of this
                                            appraisal. When and if a satisfactory system is
                                            developed, the Soviet leaders will have to consider the
                                            great cost of large-scale deployment. They would almost
                                            certainly wish to defend key urban-industrial areas and
                                            they may seek to defend some portion of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force in order to
                                            strengthen their deterrent. Beyond these
                                            generalizations, the extent to which they would commit

                                            <hi rend="italic">Soviet Ground Forces</hi>. The Soviet
                                            ground forces are formidable and modern, with a large
                                            number of combat strength divisions backed up by a large
                                            mobilization potential. All presently existing divisions
                                            have been at least nominally converted to one of three
                                            types: tank, motorized rifle, or airborne. The
                                            modernization program has made heavy demands on
                                            resources in short supply in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and it is believed
                                            that Soviet ground force capabilities are still
                                            adversely affected by quantitative and qualitative
                                            deficiencies in equipment. During the past several
                                            years, the Soviets have reduced the total number of
                                            their divisions and have also reduced the proportion
                                            maintained at high levels of combat readiness. It is
                                            estimated that the total number of Soviet divisions lies
                                            in the range 110–140 and that 60–75 of these are now
                                            maintained at combat strength, i.e., at 85 percent or
                                            more of total authorized wartime personnel strength. The
                                            remainder are at either reduced strength (60–70 percent
                                            of authorized personnel) or at cadre strength (25
                                            percent or less). The modernization of Soviet ground
                                            forces will continue. The extent of improvement,
                                            however, will be closely related to trends in total
                                            size; the larger the forces which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, elects to retain,
                                            the more it will have to contend with obsolescence and
                                            shortages. The Soviets may, therefore, choose to
                                            maintain a smaller number of ground divisions which
                                            could be kept at a higher state of readiness. If the
                                            Soviets decide that they must seriously respond to the
                                            contingency of non-nuclear warfare, they will probably
                                            provide increased combat support as well as increased
                                            service support. Present trends in the ground weapons
                                            development program point to a continuing emphasis on
                                            firepower and mobility. The Soviets could probably have
                                            the numbers of tactical nuclear weapons which they would
                                            consider requisite for theater forces within two or
                                            three years, unless priority <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0157"/>is given to air and missile defense
                                            warheads. Soviet procedures for the control and use of
                                            such weapons are likely to improve significantly. More
                                            and better general purpose vehicles and increased
                                            reliance on pipelines will reduce somewhat the Soviet
                                            dependence on rail lines for logistic support. In recent
                                            years, Soviet theater forces have acquired important
                                            tactical missile capabilities, including unguided
                                            rockets and ballistic and cruise missiles. Nuclear and
                                            toxic chemical bombs and warheads have been provided for
                                            tactical use; it is believed that their release is kept
                                            under strict political control. During the past year,
                                            the Soviets appear to have modified somewhat their
                                            expectation that any major conflict in Europe would
                                            either be nuclear from the start or would inevitably
                                            escalate. Their recent writings indicate that some
                                            thought has been given to the possibility of non-nuclear
                                            war in Europe. While Soviet capabilities to conduct
                                            non-nuclear warfare remain formidable, efforts to gear
                                            their theater forces for nuclear operations have had
                                            some adverse effects on conventional
                                            capabilities.</item>

                                            In recent years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has increased its concern with areas
                                            remote from its borders, and the Cuban venture shows
                                            that it can deploy small ground and air contingents to
                                            distant areas and maintain them once deployed. However,
                                            there is no evidence that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has established any special military
                                            component trained and equipped specifically for
                                            independent small scale operations, and it is severely
                                            limited in airlift, sealift, and naval support suitable
                                            for distant, limited military operations. It is possible
                                            that over the next few years the Soviets will seek to
                                            improve their capabilities for such operations through
                                            the designation and training of appropriate forces, and
                                            the development of equipment specifically for their use
                                            and logistic support. They may attempt to overcome their
                                            geographic disadvantages for applying such forces by
                                            negotiations with neutralist countries to utilize
                                            available facilities for refueling and maintenance of
                                            Soviet military aircraft or naval ships.</item>

                                            <hi rend="italic">Naval Forces</hi>. Much of the impetus
                                            for change in the Soviet Navy has come from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s concern over the
                                            threat posed by US carrier task forces and missile
                                            submarines. The Soviets now have operational about 45
                                            ballistic missile submarines—nine of them
                                            nuclear-powered—which carry a combined total of about
                                            125 short-range (350 nm) missiles designed for surfaced
                                            launching. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                                            developing longer range missiles for launching from
                                            submerged submarines. In addition, the Soviets have
                                            developed submarine-launched cruise missiles, which are
                                            probably designed primarily for use against ships but
                                            could be employed against land targets. In mid-1967, the
                                            Soviets will probably have more than two dozen
                                            nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, and about
                                            20 nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines. By that
                                            time, they will probably have initiated routine
                                            submarine patrols <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0158"/>within missile range of the United
                                            States. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s
                                            capabilities to conduct naval warfare in the open seas
                                            rest primarily upon the submarine force, which is
                                            capable of mounting a large scale torpedo attack and
                                            mining campaign against Allied naval targets and sea
                                            communications in the eastern North Atlantic and
                                            northwestern Pacific. Its capabilities for operations

                                            are growing. Capabilities against carrier task forces
                                            have been improved by the conversion of jet bombers to
                                            employ anti-ship missiles, by the introduction of
                                            submarines equipped with cruise-type missiles, and by
                                            increased air reconnaissance of open ocean areas by Long
                                            Range and Naval Aviation. The Soviets have also placed
                                            increasing emphasis on improvement of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces in coastal areas
                                            and in the open seas. It is believed the Soviet Navy is
                                            capable of carrying out fairly effective <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> operations in coastal
                                            areas, but that it has a negligible <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability in the open
                                            seas. Despite the effort which they almost certainly are
                                            devoting to this problem, it is believed that over the
                                            next five years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will be able to achieve only a limited

                                            It is believed that the Soviets will continue to
                                            modernize Tactical Aviation, improving its ground attack
                                            capabilities in particular. It is expected that the rate
                                            of modernization will increase over the next few years,
                                            and that tactical aircraft with much improved range and
                                            payload characteristics will be introduced. It is
                                            expected that there will be a gradual decline in total
                                            numbers of tactical aircraft. The numbers of guided
                                            missiles in Soviet theater forces will probably remain
                                            about constant, but new and improved systems will
                                            probably be introduced. It appears likely that
                                            additional free rocket launchers will be assigned to
                                            divisions. Field force air defense capabilities will
                                            improve over the next few years through the
                                            modernization of Tactical Aviation and probably through
                                            the introductions of the SA–3 or follow-on <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> systems into ground
                                            formations. It is believed that a transportable <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system for field force
                                            defense against ballistic missiles having ranges of
                                            several hundred nm could probably achieve operational
                                            status during 1964. There is no basis for determining
                                            the extent to which such a system may be deployed, but
                                            it seems likely that considerable improvement of
                                            defenses against aircraft would be a prerequisite to
                                            deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>

                                            1961–1962 nuclear test series, the Soviets probably
                                            satisfied their most pressing weapons test requirements.
                                            Research and development in this field over the next few
                                            years will probably continue to focus upon the
                                            exploitation of these test results, and their
                                            translation into weapons. The Soviet weapons stockpile
                                            still consists largely of weapons developed from tests
                                            conducted <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0159"/>before the moratorium of 1958. It is estimated that,
                                            in general, a minimum of about two years is required
                                            after testing before a new nuclear weapon begins to
                                            enter stockpile. Thus, some weapons developed in the
                                            1961–1962 test series are probably now entering
                                            inventory, with priority probably given to strategic
                                            weapons, particularly <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> warheads. Probable trends in stockpile
                                            weapons include higher yields for strategic weapons and
                                            a broader spectrum of weapons for tactical use. As the
                                            stockpile of fissionable materials grows, restrictions
                                            on the availability of weapons for tactical use and for
                                            strategic defense will ease.</item>

                                            efforts are focused on developing new toxic agents and
                                            munitions for their delivery. The lack of a satisfactory
                                            method for timely nerve agent detection remains a major
                                            weakness. Many studies potentially applicable to

                                            support functions. However, it is believed the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly is
                                            investigating the feasibility of space systems for
                                            offensive and defensive weapon systems. Soviet decisions
                                            to develop military space systems will depend on their
                                            expected costs and effectiveness as compared with
                                            alternative systems, possible political advantages or
                                            disadvantages, and the Soviet estimate of US intentions
                                            and capabilities in comparable fields. For accomplishing
                                            military missions it is believed that within this
                                            decade, orbital weapons will not compare favorably with
                                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in terms of

                                            average life, and positive control. In view of these
                                            considerations, the much greater cost of orbital weapon
                                            systems, and Soviet endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution against
                                            nuclear weapons in space, it is believed that the
                                            Soviets are unlikely to develop and deploy an orbital
                                            weapon system of military significance within the period
                                            of this estimate. If they should nevertheless do so,
                                            developmental testing should be observable at least a
                                            year or two prior to their attainment of an accurate,
                                            reliable system. In the defensive weapons field, it is
                                            believed that the Soviets intend to develop a capability
                                            to counter US military satellites. By modification of
                                            existing equipment, including air defense early warning
                                            radars and ballistic missiles, the Soviets probably
                                            could develop a limited anti-satellite capability within
                                                <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0160"/>a few
                                            months after a decision had been made to do so. Evidence
                                            indicating that the Soviets have made such a decision is
                                            not available. The Soviets could also be working toward
                                            a system designed specifically for satellite
                                            interception, but it is almost certain that no such
                                            system is operational at present. The use of co-orbiting
                                            satellites or other advanced techniques during the
                                            period of this estimate seems much less likely.</item>

                                    in strategic power, but they are confident that they possess a
                                    credible deterrent based on both their massive capabilities
                                    against Eurasia and their growing intercontinental striking
                                    forces. Thus, the Soviet leaders do not regard the deliberate
                                    initiation of general war as a feasible course of action either
                                    for themselves or for the West. Moreover, despite increased
                                    Soviet attention to the possibility of limited wars with the
                                    West, it is believed that they will remain very reluctant to
                                    commit their own forces to such wars. In this situation the
                                    Soviets would take the opportunity to conduct aggressive
                                    maneuvers of many sorts and to undertake a comprehensive effort
                                    aimed at attaining a military technological breakthrough. <list>

                                        <item>In strategic terms, this line of policy suggests that
                                            presently, and for some time to come, the Soviet
                                            strategic forces will be numerically inferior to those
                                            of the US and more vulnerable to attack. The Soviet
                                            leaders must recognize, therefore, that the US would
                                            enjoy a considerable advantage should it strike first,
                                            and that the relative invulnerability, the fast reaction
                                            time, and the mobility of US strategic power make a
                                            Soviet first strike completely irrational. Nevertheless,
                                            in assessing the military balance, the Soviets are
                                            confident that they possess a credible deterrent based
                                            on both their massive capabilities to devastate Eurasia
                                            and their growing intercontinental striking power. Thus,
                                            the Soviets see the present situation as one in which
                                            both sides are deterred from deliberately initiating
                                            general war or from knowingly initiating courses of
                                            action which would involve grave risk of such a war. The
                                            increasing nuclear capability of the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue to have

                                            intensity of conflict which might occur.</item>

                                            programs over the next several years are likely to be
                                            made in the context of a situation in which, although
                                            the US enjoys a clear strategic advantage, a condition
                                            of rough mutual deterrence exists. The Soviets will seek
                                            to improve their strategic capabilities vis-à-vis the
                                            US; however, policy decisions will be influenced by the
                                            continuing strain on economic resources, and the
                                            pressure arising from competition with the US in
                                            scientific and technological developments with military
                                            applications. Such decisions will be greatly influenced
                                            also by the Soviet estimate of the political situation,
                                            the opportunities which it affords, and the contribution
                                            which military power can make to the realization of

                                        <item>It is believed that in these circumstances the primary
                                            concern of Soviet policy will be to continue to
                                            strengthen their deterrent against US attack primarily
                                            through a gradual buildup of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, hardening of sites, and increased
                                            mobility through missile submarines. At one time the
                                            Soviets may have considered an attempt to achieve
                                            capabilities sufficient to neutralize US strategic
                                            forces in a first strike, and they almost certainly have
                                            also considered the lesser goal of achieving rough
                                            parity with the US in intercontinental weapon systems.
                                            In the aftermath of Cuba they may have considered a
                                            substantial increase in their military effort. Evidence
                                            does not indicate, however, that the Soviets are
                                            presently attempting to match the US in numbers of
                                            intercontinental delivery vehicles. Recognition that the
                                            US would detect and match or overmatch such an effort,
                                            together with economic constraints, appears to have
                                            ruled out this option. On the other hand, available
                                            evidence on the development of large nuclear warheads
                                            and compatible delivery vehicles strongly suggests that
                                            the Soviets may be seeking to improve their position
                                            relative to the West by increasing the destructive power
                                            of their numerically inferior intercontinental strategic
                                            attack forces.</item>

                                        <item>Continuation of present lines of policy will ensure
                                            the Soviets of a growing credibility for their
                                            deterrent. However, the dynamism of Soviet policy
                                            depends to a great extent on the proposition that the
                                            balance of forces in the world is shifting in favor of
                                            the communist world. The Sino-Soviet rupture has already
                                            badly damaged this thesis, as has the inability of the
                                            Soviets to match the West in military power. It is
                                            conceivable that at some point a Soviet leadership would
                                            come to believe that they had to forego their
                                            expansionist aims, unless they could greatly improve
                                            their relative military strength, or at least refurbish
                                            the world’s image of this strength. They might even be
                                            willing to make new economic sacrifices or assume some
                                            risks in order to accomplish this. What precise programs
                                            they might undertake in pursuit of such an aim cannot
                                            now be stated, but it cannot be ruled out that changes
                                            in the scale or character of Soviet programs could come
                                            about in this way.</item>

                                            Soviet military writings assume deliberate, surprise
                                            attack by the US, although some consider escalation from
                                            limited war and a few allow for the possibility that
                                            general war would begin accidentally. The criticality of
                                            the initial period of a nuclear war and the importance
                                            of surprise have led some military writers to advocate a
                                            form of pre-emptive action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: i.e., a “spoiling”

                                            slightly before an enemy attack. However, known
                                            doctrinal discussions do not consider a Soviet first
                                            strike. In the standard scenario, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> survives a nuclear
                                            attack, regains the initiative, and goes on to prosecute

                                            inevitably involve the large-scale use of nuclear and
                                            other weapons of mass destruction, beginning with a
                                            strategic exchange which may decide the course and
                                            outcome of the war in its initial phase, a relatively
                                            brief but not clearly defined period of time. To the
                                            Soviets, the importance of this phase implies the
                                            necessity to use all available forces at the outset of a
                                            general war; the doctrinal writings which are available
                                            have noted and rejected such US concepts as controlled
                                            response and damage limiting strategies. Moreover, no
                                            restraint is evident in targeting concepts for the
                                            initial phase of a general war; while enemy nuclear
                                            striking forces are evidently to be the primary targets
                                            of Soviet nuclear strikes, powerful nuclear blows are
                                            also to be directed against communication and control
                                            centers, industrial and population centers, and

                                            missile forces, current Soviet doctrine envisions the
                                            commitment of large theater forces virtually at the
                                            outset of a general war. It is argued that, even if the
                                            war is relatively short, large forces of all types would
                                            be required to defeat comparable enemy forces, to
                                            overrun base areas, and to occupy territory in Eurasia.
                                            Moreover, it is also held that the conflict may be
                                            protracted rather than brief and that, in this case,
                                            extensive theater campaigns would be required. Thus,
                                            current Soviet doctrine supports a military policy
                                            emphasizing strategic attack and defense capabilities,
                                            but supports as well the maintenance of large general
                                            purpose forces for use in all phases of general

                                            doctrine as well. Certain key issues, such as the
                                            decisiveness of the initial phase, evidently remain
                                            unresolved. Moreover, certain vital questions seem to
                                            have been ignored. For example, while purporting to deal
                                            with a global war in which all types of weapons are
                                            employed, the current military writings to which there
                                            is access, concern themselves almost exclusively with
                                                <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0163"/>theater
                                            forces in Europe. Adequate consideration is not given to
                                            the effects of a strategic nuclear exchange on
                                            subsequent operations. Virtually no attention is given
                                            to the way in which a general war might be brought to a
                                            successful conclusion; it seems to be assumed either
                                            that US society would collapse as the result of the
                                            initial nuclear attack, or that in a long war the Soviet
                                            system would prove the more durable.</item>

                                    recognizes that, while general war is unlikely, it cannot be
                                    excluded as the result of miscalculation by either side or as
                                    the outcome of a crisis in which both sides become progressively
                                    committed. The Soviets are unable to be certain in advance what
                                    the circumstances surrounding the beginning of a general war
                                    would be. A miscalculation could occur if the Soviets misjudged
                                    either the importance to the West of an issue and the actions
                                    which the West might take in support of its position, or even
                                    the consequences of the policies being pursued by a third party
                                    associated with the Soviet Union. On the other hand, such a
                                    crisis might arise should the West miscalculate in a similar
                                    way.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Pre-emptive attack</hi>. If the Soviet leaders
                                    were ever absolutely certain that the West was irrevocably
                                    committed to an imminent strategic nuclear attack against them,
                                    there is little question that they would themselves strike
                                    pre-emptively. Such certainty, however, on the part of any
                                    country about the intentions of another is extremely unlikely.
                                    The Soviet leaders probably conclude that it would be impossible
                                    to count upon incontrovertible advance evidence that the enemy
                                    was irrevocably committed to an imminent attack. Moreover, for
                                    the Soviet Union, the compulsion to strike first, when the
                                    threat of hostile attack is still ambiguous, declines as US
                                    missile systems become more important and less vulnerable and
                                    the advantage to be derived from a first strike consequently
                                    decreases. This trend of Soviet thinking is suggested by
                                    assertions that an aggressor cannot neutralize the retaliatory
                                    capability of a powerful opponent. Nevertheless, a surprise
                                    attack—that is to say, one delivered in a period of no
                                    particular tension and after entirely secret military
                                    preparations—is the only one which would give the Soviet Union a
                                    chance of destroying any significant part of the Western nuclear
                                    strike capability before it could be launched. Therefore, in
                                    spite of its unlikelihood, it remains a possible, though
                                    improbable course of action for the Soviet Union.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Escalation</hi>. A number of Soviet statements
                                    in recent years have expressed the view that limited war
                                    involving the major nuclear powers would inevitably escalate
                                    into general war. While such statements are intended in part to
                                    deter the West from local use of force, this official view also
                                    reflects a genuine Soviet fear of the consequences of becoming
                                    directly engaged in limited war involving Soviet and US <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0164"/>forces. This probably
                                    also extends to involvement of Soviet forces with certain Allied
                                    forces in highly critical areas, notably Western forces in the
                                    European area. Nevertheless, they might employ their own forces
                                    to achieve local gains in some area adjacent to Bloc territory
                                    if they judged that the West, either because it was deterred by
                                    Soviet nuclear power or for some other reason, would not make an
                                    effective military response. They would probably employ Soviet
                                    forces as necessary if some Western military action on the
                                    periphery of the Soviet Bloc threatened the integrity of the
                                    Bloc itself. Should the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                    become directly involved in a limited war with the US or Allied
                                    forces, it is believed that the Soviets would not necessarily
                                    expand it immediately into general war, but that they would
                                    probably employ only that force which they thought necessary to
                                    achieve their local objectives. They would also seek to prevent
                                    escalation both by restraints in the employment of their own
                                    forces and by political means. In view of the increasingly grave
                                    consequences of escalation, it is believed that over the next
                                    few years the Soviets will remain very reluctant to commit their
                                    own forces to limited warfare against Western forces. Despite
                                    recent Soviet references to the possibility of limited war
                                    involving tactical nuclear weapons, it is considered highly
                                    unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                                    introduce such weapons into a limited conflict. The Soviet
                                    doctrinal debate, as far as it is known, has not dealt with
                                    limited war; it is therefore possible that discussion has been
                                    limited by official attitudes. Public Soviet statements have
                                    usually insisted that a limited war which involved the major
                                    nuclear powers would inevitably escalate into general war.
                                    Official pronouncements to this effect have almost certainly
                                    been designed in large part to deter the West from the local use
                                    of force, but they probably also reflected Soviet fears of
                                    becoming involved in limited war. The Soviets now appear to be
                                    modifying their position to allow for the possibility that even
                                    a limited war involving the major nuclear powers would not
                                    necessarily escalate to general war. They may now be persuaded
                                    that in the present strategic situation, the initial military
                                    reactions to a local crisis would be limited, and that it is
                                    therefore, not in the Soviet national interest to be doctrinally
                                    committed to inevitable escalation.</item>

                                                  Communist China almost certainly intends to
                                                  achieve domestic production of all necessary
                                                  weapons and materiel for its armed forces. It has
                                                  a long way to go before reaching this goal,
                                                  however. The Chinese at present are probably
                                                  unable to produce even MIG–17s entirely by
                                                  themselves, and it will be a number of years
                                                  before they can design and produce more advanced
                                                  types of military aircraft. Indeed they may have
                                                  chosen instead to concentrate their limited
                                                  resources on missiles. Their wholly domestic naval
                                                  shipbuilding capacity is likely to be restricted

                                                  China’s military equipment and weapons is likely
                                                  to temper its policy, especially in circumstances
                                                  where it might confront US armed power or sizable
                                                  US-equipped Asian forces. However, the Chinese

                                                  watch than previously on the long China-Russian
                                                  border which the Chinese still consider a
                                                  “difficult” and “unsettled” question. Her slowly

                                                  will increase an already considerable military
                                                  advantage over Asian neighbors. However, for the

                                                  unlikely to attribute a decisive importance to
                                                  modern weaponry. They would probably continue to
                                                  rely primarily on a huge ground force and, unless

                                                  are the preservation of the regime and the

                                                  regardless of the odds. If US or Allied troops

                                                  unless in the particular circumstances they saw
                                                  greater advantage in more covert military
                                                  operations. The acquisition of Taiwan falls in the

                                                  only when the prospects of success are judged to
                                                  be high. To achieve this goal, they are <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0167"/>prepared to

                                                  almost certainly will not attempt to seize by
                                                  military force either Taiwan or any of the major
                                                  offshore islands which they believe the United
                                                  States would help defend. It is not believed that

                                                  power balance among the major states and could not
                                                  do so in the foreseeable future. In particular,
                                                  they would recognize that they remained unable
                                                  either to remove or neutralize the US presence in
                                                  Asia. Nevertheless, the Chinese would feel very
                                                  much stronger and this mood would doubtless be
                                                  reflected in their approach to conflicts on their
                                                  periphery. They would probably feel that the
                                                  United States would be more reluctant to intervene
                                                  on the Asian mainland and thus the tone of Chinese
                                                  policy will probably become more assertive.
                                                  Further, their possession of nuclear weapons and
                                                  missiles would reinforce their efforts to achieve
                                                  Asian hegemony through political pressures and the
                                                  indirect support of local “wars of liberation.”

                                                  effectiveness, since the Chinese feat would have a
                                                  profound impact on neighboring governments and
                                                  peoples. It would alter the latter’s sense of the
                                                  relations of power, even if it made little
                                                  immediate change in the realities of power, and to
                                                  a greater or lesser degree would probably result
                                                  in increased pressures to accommodate to Chinese
                                                  demands.</item>

                                                  lands in the name of communism, but intends to let

                                                  “liberating”. The Chinese Communists are actively

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>The Emergency Planning Committee, appointed by the President on February 14,
                            1962,<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">Not further identified.</note> and
                        composed of representatives of the Department of Defense, the Bureau of the
                        Budget, and the Office of Emergency Planning, has been engaged in a review
                        of various aspects of nonmilitary emergency preparedness planning. I have
                        previously reported to you on the operations of this Committee (July 19,
                        1962, and March 11, 1963).<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Neither

                    </p>
                    <p>A major area of concern to the Committee has been the lack of a clearly
                        defined system for the <hi rend="italic">central management of resources
                            under emergency conditions</hi>, including nuclear attack. The Office of
                        Emergency Planning was directed by President Kennedy to prepare a plan for
                        such a system in order to assure that, in an emergency, resources would be
                        used with maximum effectiveness in the national interest. Recommendations on
                        this matter were incorporated in a report which was approved by the
                        Committee and submitted to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> for approval. A copy of the report is enclosed.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">The 11-page report (plus 1-page organizational
                            chart), entitled “Central Management of Resources After Nuclear Attack,”

                    </p>
                    <p>I have received a memorandum from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, dated June 30, 1964, in which he states that:

                                an extremely critical area of our total preparedness effort. I am
                                pleased to note the progress being made in this field.</p>
                            <p>“The concept of an Office of Defense Resources, to be activated by
                                the President in an emergency, is approved. This is a key element in
                                further progress in this area of preparedness and I believe you
                                should proceed with the development of the measures necessary to
                                bring this, and any related programs, into an early state of standby
                                    readiness.”<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5">This 3-paragraph

                                    1966. The final paragraph reads: “I also agree with the
                                    advisability of selecting an Emergency Designee to head the

                                    recommendations regarding qualified persons who might be
                                    considered for this important emergency assignment will be

                    <p>The proposed organizational structure for the postattack central management
                        of resources for mobilization and recovery will be developed with two
                        primary considerations in mind: (1) the need for a central policy and
                        coordinating organization reporting to, and acting on behalf of, the
                        President; and (2) the need to make maximum use of the departments and
                        agencies with emergency preparedness assignments under Executive Orders.
                        Future work in this area of emergency preparedness will take full advantage
                        of the capabilities of existing agencies.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense has an important role in this undertaking. It is
                        counted upon to provide the leadership in the fields of civil defense, and
                        military requirements. It will also contribute substantially to program
                        development in other fields such as manpower, material resources, and
                        communications.</p>
                    <p>I am calling a meeting on August 31, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 474, Executive
                        Office Building, at which the basic concept and approach involved in central
                        resources management will be presented to all agencies with mobilization
                        responsibilities. After that meeting, there will be a period of active
                        interagency staff work directed toward the early development of programs
                        that can be made operational as quickly as possible in an emergency.</p>
                    <p>I will appreciate a letter designating someone qualified to speak for your
                        Department to represent you at the August 31 meeting.<note n="6" xml:id="d44fn6">An August 21 letter from <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MDEA1">McDermott</persName> designated <persName corresp="#p_HS9">Solis

                    <p>Mac told me this morning that he had had a good long talk with <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on the above subject. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> had told him that he planned to go
                        “quite a long way” in briefing the top Europeans that should be filled in on
                        our program. He will be in England in September and from there will go to
                        the other countries involved. He will probably take Bud Wheelon with him to
                        assist in the briefings.</p>
                    <p>Mac appeared satisfied with this arrangement and said that the timing was
                        such that it might be helpful in case we had to make use of the information
                        in some way during the next couple months.</p>
                    <p>Mac asked me to stay in touch with this matter and to pass the word that he
                        would like to see the briefing materials before <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> leaves.</p>
                    <p>I called Bud Wheelon and told him of this talk and of Mac’s request that I
                        stay in touch with him. He had not been filled in by the Director and
                        expressed his appreciation for receiving the information. He picked up the
                        ball right away and said that he would take the initiative in having the
                        briefing materials prepared both on our program and the Soviet program. I
                        was unable to reach Garthoff and Scoville, both of whom are on leave, and
                        will try again on Monday.</p>
                    <p>Mac also suggested that I fill in Peter Jessup with the thought that he might
                        put this on the agenda for a “303 meeting”.</p>

                        make public for the first time that in 1960–61 we eliminated from our

                        percent reduction in the total yield of our stockpile.</p>
                    <p>(The reduction was personally approved by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in 1960 on the unanimous

                    <p>During 1964 the White House Office of Emergency Planning began to put
                        together a long-range civil emergency preparedness program. The completed
                        73-page study, entitled “A Report to the President: Civil Emergency
                        Preparedness; Program Status and a Five-Year Projection,” dated August 31,
                        1964, included an introductory section outlining the roles of the Office of
                        Emergency Planning and of other departments and agencies, and the concepts
                        underlying its proposed 5-year future program. The bulk of the report
                        consisted of a statement of the 5-year objectives and status covering
                        government in an emergency and the resources availability and their
                        management. Also included was a summary treatment of civil defense. A copy
                        of the report is in the National Archives and Records Administration, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 1 US.</p>
                    <p>Attached to this copy of the report is a September 16 covering memorandum

                        direction issued by General <persName>Carter</persName> does not reflect our
                        agreement in one very important detail. As you remember, you and I had
                        agreed that an <gloss target="#t_SETD1">SETD</gloss>

                        the work of integration and technical direction would be conducted by the
                        contractor and not by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> personnel. You may
                        find the definition of systems engineering technical director given in

                    <p>CAP 64320. This is preliminary <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> comment on
                        Khrushchev’s weapon statement: <list>
                            <item>“1. On 15 September Khrushchev told a visiting delegation of
                                Japanese socialist members of parliament that the Soviet Union has
                                developed a ‘monstrous new, terrible weapon.’ He stated that on 14
                                September he had been shown a weapon of terrible destruction by
                                military men, scientists and engineers. He is quoted as having said,
                                ‘I have never seen anything like it. It is a method of destroying
                                and exterminating mankind. It is the strongest and most powerful of
                                existing weapons. Its power is limitless.’</item>
                            <item>2. After mentioning the weapon, Khrushchev launched into an attack
                                on Chinese border claims and accused Mao Tse-tung of spreading
                                warlike sentiments. Earlier Khrushchev has recalled the tragedy of
                                the Japanese people, the first in history to suffer the atomic bomb.
                                Alluding to the Chinese, Khrushchev said that he who says that the
                                atomic bomb is a paper tiger is crazy.</item>
                            <item>3. The choice of audience, and the context in which Khrushchev’s
                                statement regarding the new weapon was delivered, suggest that he
                                intended the threat implied by this new development to be taken as
                                directed primarily against the Chinese.</item>
                            <item>4. While Khrushchev gave no specific clues concerning the nature
                                of the weapon, we did have an indication four months ago that
                                Khrushchev wanted us to know beforehand that he was going to make
                                such an announcement.</item>
                            <item>5. Last May [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>], two Soviet KGB officers deliberately
                                revealed themselves as such to a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                                officer, and told him that they knew he was a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officer. The spokesman for the two
                                then asked twice ‘very positively’ that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> officer inform Washington that the Soviet
                                Government was soon to make a very important announcement on
                                development of a Soviet military capability <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0178"/>which ‘would not be used against
                                the West but would be very effective against the Chinese.’ The
                                spokesman said he was not authorized to reveal the details.</item>
                            <item>6. The delay between this tip-off is that Khrushchev wanted us to
                                know that the announced claim of a new weapon, when it came, would
                                be directed at the Chinese and that we should not be concerned by
                                it. It also is possible that Khrushchev had information indicating
                                that the Chinese were going to claim a nuclear capability this year
                                and timed the announcement to blunt the political effect of such a
                                development.</item>
                            <item>8.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">There is no numbered paragraph
                                    7.</note> We have no information on any specific Soviet weapon
                                development which would equate to Khrushchev’s description.</item>
                            <item>9. It is improbable that a new delivery system was the subject of
                                his remarks since the Soviets have long claimed the ability to
                                deliver their largest nuclear weapons by missile and to attack from
                                any direction, although a January 1960 Khrushchev statement
                                referring to a ‘fantastic weapon’ then in the hatching stage may
                                have referred to the 100 megaton bomb. It seems improbable that his
                                present ‘new weapon’ would refer to such a previously well
                                publicized capability. It is unlikely in the absence of appropriate
                                nuclear tests that the Soviets have had the opportunity to develop
                                significantly larger nuclear weapons that could be used with
                                confidence.</item>
                            <item>10. It is similarly difficult to conceive of radiological weapons
                                that would fit Khrushchev’s description. It is now possible, through
                                appropriate selection of weapons and burst altitude, to contaminate
                                very large areas with lethal radioactivity. These effects probably
                                could be somewhat enhanced by alterations in weapon design, perhaps
                                including the salting of weapons with materials such as cobalt. Such
                                capabilities would not appear to be new or very significantly
                                superior to those now possessed by the major nuclear powers.</item>
                            <item>11. In the biological warfare field, we have no information that
                                agents capable of the extermination of mankind have been developed.
                                Other scientific developments with weapons potential, such as
                                lasers, do not appear to meet the mass destruction criteria of
                                Khrushchev’s description.</item>
                            <item>12. If in fact a monstrous new weapon exists, Khrushchev’s
                                statements imply that it is in the developmental rather than
                                production state. If the weapon is ‘very effective’against the
                                Chinese but not against the West, anti-personnel weapons such as
                                biological or radiological weapons, are suggested. We have, however,
                                no evidence of spectacular developments in the fields.”</item>

                            requested to advise the Secretary of Defense as regards what functions

                        <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that, if a <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> is approved and constructed as an element of the

                            advisors to the President. If the President and his civilian and

                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Communications requirements vary considerably between critical
                            international crises and general war. A need exists for an extensive
                            world-wide network of reliable communications during crisis situations.
                            After general war begins, the emphasis would then switch to survivable
                            communications among the major command centers of the World-Wide
                            Military Command and Control System primarily for the strategic
                            direction of the military forces. However, there would remain a need for
                            communications with the principal civil defense centers, and for
                            negotiations with the principal adversary. Therefore, it appears that
                            the functions of command communications would require that the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> be equipped with communications which
                            approximate the capability now planned for the Alternate National
                            Military Command Center.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>It appears that the concept and capability reflected in the National
                            Emergency Airborne Command Post would represent the minimum capability
                            required in a <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> to serve as an
                            emergency command post for decision-making by the President. It is
                            envisioned that the decision group, which would relocate to the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss>, would comprise the National Command
                            Authorities with a minimum number of <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0181"/>advisory personnel, and that they would remain in the
                                <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> in a post-attack situation
                            only until the National Command Authorities could be relocated to a site
                            from which the functions of government could more adequately be
                            discharged. Basically, however, advisory information would be provided
                            the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> by existing and surviving
                            alternate command facilities equipped with larger data bases. A minimum
                            data base would be maintained in the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> and staff support, to the extent feasible, would be
                            provided to the decision group.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The determination of the precise number of people the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> must house in order to support the
                            total mission of the facility, including the operation of the national
                            government in crisis situations as well as the conduct of general
                            nuclear war, would necessitate considerable liaison with the White
                            House, and other departments and agencies of the national government.
                            However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that approximately 50
                            military personnel would be required to perform their part of the above
                            functions in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. The figure
                            does not include personnel for facility maintenance, communications,
                            security, and housekeeping support for which about 175 additional people
                            can be identified at this time. Additional functions and personnel
                            possibly would be required to operate the national government in
                            accordance with the desires of the President, and to the extent outlined
                            in the reference. These latter requirements should be provided by the
                            appropriate Departments and Agencies concerned, in order that the
                            composite functional and personnel requirements, and hence the optimum
                            size of the facility, may be established.</item>

                        armed satellites. I would like to give you, within the limits of military
                        security, some additional information about this capability.</p>
                    <p>The two anti-satellite systems which the President discussed are operated by
                        the Army and the Air Force. They are under the operational control of the
                        Continental Air Defense Command. They make use of certain Navy facilities as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The Army system uses the Nike Zeus missile while the Air Force system employs
                        the Thor missile. Both systems utilize the data from our global space
                        detection and tracking network which includes various radars, sensors and
                        computers.</p>
                    <p>The Army program to develop an anti-satellite capability was begun in May of
                        1962 and the Air Force program early in 1963.</p>
                    <p>It is especially significant that both the Army and the Air Force
                        successfully intercepted satellites a year after I directed them to achieve
                        this capability. The Army system was operational on August 1, 1963, the Air
                        Force system on May 29, 1964.</p>
                    <p>The two systems have been effectively tested and have intercepted satellites
                        in space, their missiles passing so close as to be within the destruction
                        radius of the warheads.</p>
                    <p>The bases at which these anti-satellite systems are deployed is classified
                        information. <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0183"/>To date, we have
                        invested $80,000,000 to achieve this capability. This figure does not
                        include the funds we are spending on items like the Space Detection and
                        Tracking System and the Anti-Intercontinental Ballistic Missile system.</p>
                    <p>The family of over-the-horizon radars also announced yesterday by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> is one of the most
                        dramatic examples of new developments.</p>
                    <p>These new systems will bounce radar signals off the ionosphere and send them
                        to the earth far beyond the horizon. Missiles being launched reflect or
                        otherwise influence these signals which are received back at the
                        transmitting station or at other points far beyond the horizon. These
                        signals are then processed by electronic techniques to provide target
                        detection and identification. Capabilities also exist against aircraft.</p>
                    <p>More than $50,000,000 has been invested in this program to develop and
                        produce installations for these missile and aircraft detection systems. This
                        radar will provide detection of missiles within seconds of launch at a
                        distance of several thousand miles. <hi rend="italic">End Text.</hi>

                            election campaign, Barry Goldwater, the Republican Party nominee, made
                            statements about nuclear weapons pre-delegation. In response, President

                            Seattle, Washington, on September 16, said that he alone exercised
                            control over the use of nuclear weapons. The text of his speech is in

                            was not accurate and was open “to the charge of deception,” he preferred
                            a second option, that “you should make a statement in which you make
                            clear that there are indeed very specialized contingencies for which
                            certain Presidential instructions already exist.” (Johnson Library,

                    <p>On March 26 you approved recommendations from <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the Joint Chiefs to put into effect updated
                        instructions for expenditure of nuclear weapons in emergency
                            conditions.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">See <ref target="#d24">Document
                                24</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>This instruction covers four emergency situations. Two of them are
                        essentially defensive and would allow the use of nuclear weapons only
                        against military targets in the air or at sea. These are: 1) active defense
                        against air and space nuclear attack on the U.S., and 2) naval and air
                        action against an imminent seaborne missile attack on the U.S.</p>
                    <p>In these two cases the commanders could act without contacting the President
                        if the necessary delay would make it impossible for them to prevent the
                        imminent attack.</p>
                    <p>The other two cases are 1) retaliation to a nuclear attack on the U.S., and
                        2) reply to a major assault on major U.S. forces at sea or in foreign
                        territory. In these two cases every effort to contact the President must be
                        made (with the qualifying phrase in the second case: “every effort
                        consistent with the preservation of his command”). The authorized
                        retaliation for an attack on the U.S. is a strategic attack on the Soviet
                        Union. The authorized retaliation in the other case is against hostile
                        forces but not repeat not against the Soviet Union itself.</p>
                    <p>The instructions reveal an interesting difference between situations in which
                        nuclear weapons would do enormous civilian and industrial damage and
                        situations in which they would be used in the upper atmosphere <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0185"/>or on the high seas. In the latter cases
                        commanders have latitude to decide that the delay in contacting the
                        President would be excessive. This is in line with a belief which <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had that when the destructive
                        force of nuclear weapons would hit only military forces, the decision on
                        their use was a very much less serious matter. It is possible that we ought
                        to take account of this distinction in anything we say in the next few
                        days.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Summary and Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Major changes in Soviet programs for the development of strategic attack
                        forces have become apparent during the past year. In 1962–1963, certain
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and ballistic missile submarine
                        programs came to an end, and a pause ensued in the growth of these forces.
                        At the same time, the pace of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> research
                        and development increased markedly. More recently, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has resumed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment in a new and improved configuration, and the
                        probable advent of a new submarine which we believe is designed to carry
                        ballistic missiles probably marks the start of yet another deployment
                        program. (Para. 1)</p>
                    <p>B. Soviet military policy in recent years has been to build up strategic
                        offensive and defensive capabilities, maintain and improve large general
                        purpose forces, and pursue research and development programs in advanced
                        weapons. In our view, the primary concern of Soviet military policy for the
                        next several years will continue to be the strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s strategic deterrent. The evidence to
                        date does not indicate that Soviet deployment programs are directed toward a
                        rapid numerical buildup. We do not believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> aims at matching the US in numbers of intercontinental
                        delivery vehicles. Recognition that the US would detect and match or
                        overmatch such an effort, together with economic constraints, appears to
                        have ruled out this option. (Paras. 2–4)</p>
                    <p>C. A stress on qualitative factors suggests that the Soviets see
                        technological advance in weapons as a means by which they can improve their
                        strategic position relative to the West. In the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, for example, major qualitative improvements
                        currently being achieved include hardening and dispersal (which will sharply
                        increase the number of aiming points), as well as better accuracy and larger
                        payloads. (Paras. 4–5)</p>
                    <p>D. By the end of the decade, Soviet intercontinental attack capabilities will
                        rest primarily upon an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of some
                        hundreds of launchers, supplemented by a sizable missile-submarine fleet and
                        a large but reduced bomber force. These forces will represent a marked
                        improvement in Soviet retaliatory capability and a considerable
                        strengthening of the Soviet deterrent. In the light of current and
                        programmed US military capabilities, however, we do not believe that the
                        Soviets will expect to achieve, within the period of this estimate,
                        strategic attack capabilities which would make rational the deliberate
                        initiation of general war. (Para. 5)</p>

                    <p>E. Major developments since mid-1963 include a proliferation of test
                        facilities at Tyuratam, flight-testing of two third-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0187"/>systems (the SS–9 and SS–10), and
                        the beginning of construction of hard, single-silo <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, probably for one or both of the new systems.
                        The deployment of second-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        has probably ceased, and a pause between the second-and third-generation
                        programs has slowed deployment. We believe that the Soviets now have about
                        200 operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, and that
                        the total number of operational launchers in mid-1965 will approximate the
                        low side of the 250–350 range previously estimated. These figures do not
                        include <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> launchers at Tyuratam.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, considers the estimate of the

                            low. He estimates that the Soviets now have about 240 operational
                            launchers, including about 20 at Tyuratam and a 10 percent allowance for
                            unlocated launchers. He believes the total number in mid-1965 will be
                            between 275 and 325. See his footnote, page 11, para. 10. [Footnote in

                            increasing the estimate to 240.]</note> (Paras 6–8, 10–18, 31)</p>
                    <p>F. Research and development on third-generation systems has been generally
                        successful. The SS–9 system appears to be an outgrowth of the SS–7 with
                        improved accuracy and a larger payload. We have little information on the
                        characteristics of the SS–10. Both new systems could enter service in 1965.
                        We believe that work is underway on still other <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems, which we cannot as yet identify. We continue to
                        believe that the Soviets are developing a very large <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, capable of delivering [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. We estimate
                        that it could enter service in the period mid-1966 to mid-1967. In addition,
                        the Soviets might be developing a new, small <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> employing improved propellants. If they are, it could
                        become operational as early as 1967. (Paras. 19–26)</p>
                    <p>G. The Soviets are now emphasizing deployment of single-silo hard launchers
                        for <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, and we expect this emphasis to
                        continue. We expect third-generation deployment to include the expansion of
                        both second-generation complexes and the initiation of additional new
                        complexes. (Paras. 9, 27)</p>
                    <p>H. The growth of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force over
                        the next several years will be influenced by a number of factors. In
                        economic terms, the program must compete for funds with other military and
                        space activities and with the civilian economy. In the technical field, we
                        believe that research and development is proceeding on additional, follow-on
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems, and we doubt that with
                        these in the offing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will fix upon
                        any one or even two existing systems for urgent deployment on a large scale.
                        We are also mindful that the interruptions that marked second-generation
                        deployment programs may recur. In strategic terms, the Soviets evidently
                        judge that an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force in the hundreds of
                        launchers, together with their other strategic forces, provides a deterrent.
                        On <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0188"/>the basis of the evidence now
                        available to us, we do not believe that they are attempting to deploy a
                        force capable of a first-strike which would reduce the effects of US
                        retaliation to an acceptable level.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">The Assistant

                            military <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort toward
                            achievement of an effective first-strike counter-force capability before

                            possibility which should not be disregarded. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> At the same time, we expect them to continue a vigorous
                            <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort in the hope of achieving
                        important technological advances, in both the offensive and defensive
                        fields, which would alter the present strategic relationship in a major way.
                        (Para. 30)</p>
                    <p>I. We estimate a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of
                        400–700 operational launchers for mid-1970; in our previous estimate, we
                        projected this force level for mid-1969. By mid-1970, we believe that the
                        force will include most or all of the launchers now deployed, some 125–200
                        single-silo SS–9/10 launchers, and 10–20 launchers for very large <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. We believe that the attainment of as
                        many as 700 operational launchers by mid-1970 would be likely only if the
                        Soviets begin deploying a new, small <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        at a rapid rate about 1967. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force which we estimate for mid-1970 will represent a substantial increase
                        in numbers and deliverable megatonnage. Further, the trend to single silos
                        will increase the number of aiming points represented by individual launch
                        sites from about 100 at present to some 300–575 in mid-1970, the bulk of
                        them hard. This will greatly improve the survivability, and hence the
                        retaliatory capability, of the force.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">The
                            Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, considers the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            force by mid-1970 could range from approximately 600 to as high as 900
                            operational launchers depending on whether a new, small, easily deployed
                            system is introduced. (See his footnote to table on page 18.) An <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of this size would increase the
                            number of aiming points represented by individual launch sites to
                            approximately 400–700 in mid-1970. [Footnote in the source text. This
                            footnote on page 18 develops the rationale for higher projections of

                    <p>J. In the past few years the Soviets have improved the readiness and reaction
                        time of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. Our evidence now
                        indicates that from the normal state of readiness, the soft sites which
                        constitute the bulk of the present force would require 1–3 hours to fire.
                        Hard sites would require about half an hour or less. A higher state of alert
                        (i.e., 5–15 minutes to fire) can be maintained at most soft sites for a
                        number of hours and at most hard sites for days. (Paras. 38–40)</p>
                    <p>K. There is ample evidence that the Soviets designed their soft <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems to have a refire capability. We
                        have re-examined the factors likely to affect refire time, and conclude that
                        it would require little longer to fire the second missile than the first.
                        Our present estimate of <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0189"/>refire time
                        is 2–4 hours, considerably less than previously estimated. We believe that,
                        on the average, two or more missiles are provided per soft launcher for
                        initial firing, refire, and maintenance spares. We believe that hard <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites do not have a refire capability.
                        (Paras. 41–43)</p>
                    <p>L. We have little evidence on the hardness of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites. Given the many uncertainties in this area, only a
                        very tenuous estimate can be made, but our best judgment is that Soviet hard
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> sites have a hardness in the
                        300–600 psi range. This implies a design overpressure in the 200–400 psi
                        range, somewhat higher than previously estimated.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, considers that, given the uncertainties involved, no
                            meaningful estimate of the hardness of Soviet hard sites can be made.
                            However, he believes that the design overpressure of Soviet hard sites
                            is no greater than the 100–300 psi previously estimated. [Footnote in
                            the source text.]</note> (Paras 49–50)</p>
                    <p>M. Qualitative improvements in the force can be expected as new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems enter service. Currently
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s have <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>s on the order of 1–2 n.m. The SS–9 will
                        probably have an accuracy of 0.5–1.0 n.m. with radio assist, or 1.0–1.5 with
                        all-inertial guidance. By mid-1970, the Soviets could achieve accuracies on
                        the order of 0.5 n.m. or better. The SS–9 will probably carry a payload [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] as
                        compared with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] for second-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. We do not believe that the Soviets have yet developed
                        penetration aids or multiple warheads, but they may do so in the future,
                        particularly if the US deploys antimissile defenses. (Paras. 44–48)</p>

                    <p>N. Deployment programs for the 1,020 n.m. <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> and the 2,200 n.m. IRBM are now ending, and almost
                        certainly will be completed by mid-1965. We estimate that at that time the
                            <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM force will have a strength of
                        about 760 operational launchers, 145 of them hard. The bulk of the force
                        (about 90 percent) is deployed in western <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, with the remainder in the southern and far eastern
                        regions of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This force is capable
                        of delivering a devastating first strike or a powerful retaliatory attack
                        against targets in Eurasia, and can attack such areas as Greenland and
                        Alaska as well. Some of the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM
                        launchers are probably intended to support ground operations. (Paras.
                        51–55)</p>
                    <p>O. We doubt that the Soviets will expand their <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM force during the period of this estimate. It is
                        possible, however, that operational capabilities will be improved by the
                        introduction of a new missile system, which probably would be deployed in
                        single-silos. Such a system, employing unproved propellants, could become
                        operational in the 1966–1968 period and would probably replace some of the
                        soft launchers now operational. (Paras. 56–59)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>P. The Soviets now have operational some 40–50 ballistic missile submarines,
                        including 8–10 nuclear powered. Most of these submarines are equipped with
                        350 n.m. missiles and must surface to fire. One or two are equipped with a
                        new 700 n.m. submerged-launch missile, and others will probably be
                        retrofitted. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also has operational
                        about 30 cruise-missile submarines, including 11–14 nuclear powered. The
                        majority are equipped with 300 n.m. missiles designed for low altitude
                        attack, primarily against ships. The remainder carry a newer 450 n.m.
                        version of this missile, which probably has an improved capability to attack
                        land targets. Current Soviet missile submarines carry relatively few
                        missiles: the ballistic missile classes, two or three, and the cruise
                        missile types, up to eight. The entire present force has a total of 120–140
                        ballistic missile tubes and 135–150 cruise-missile launchers. (Paras.
                        60–71)</p>
                    <p>Q. We believe that the Soviets have under construction a submarine which we
                        estimate to be the first of a new nuclear-powered, ballistic missile class.
                        We estimate that it will employ the submerged launch 700 n.m. missile, and
                        have a few more missile tubes than current classes. The first unit will
                        probably become operational in 1965. Beyond this new class, we consider it
                        unlikely that the Soviets will develop an entirely new follow-on ballistic
                        missile submarine system within the period of this estimate, although they
                        will probably continue to improve existing systems. We believe that they
                        will also continue to construct cruise-missile submarines. By mid-1970 the
                        Soviet missile submarine force will probably number 100–130 ships, about
                        half of them cruise-missile submarines and about half ballistic. (Paras.
                        72–75)</p>
                    <p>R. In the past year, limited numbers of Soviet missile submarines have
                        engaged in patrols in the open oceans. We expect a gradual expansion of this
                        activity. By the end of the decade, Soviet missile submarines will probably
                        be conducting regular patrols throughout the North Atlantic and Pacific, and
                        possibly into the Mediterranean. (Para. 76)</p>

                        and 850–900 mediums. It is being improved primarily through the continued
                        introduction of Blinder supersonic dash medium bombers and through
                        modification of older bombers for air-to-surface missile delivery, for
                        aerial refueling, and for reconnaissance. Use of both medium and heavy
                        bombers of the <gloss target="#t_LRA1">LRA</gloss> in support of marine
                        operations has increased. (Paras. 80–86)</p>

                    <p>T. Considering noncombat attrition factors and the requirements for Arctic
                        staging and aerial refueling, we estimate that the Soviets could put
                        somewhat more than 100 heavy bombers over target areas in the US on two-way
                        missions. Recent trends lead us to believe that medium bombers do not now
                        figure prominently in Soviet plans for an initial bomber attack against
                        North America. Nevertheless, should they elect to do so, we believe that at
                        present the Soviets could put up to 150 Badgers over North American target
                        areas on two-way missions. We have serious doubt about how effectively the
                        Soviets could launch large-scale bomber operations against North America. We
                        consider it probable that initial attacks would not be simultaneous, but
                        would extend over a considerable number of hours.<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, considers this paragraph seriously underestimates the
                            manned aircraft threat to the continental US. In the event war should
                            eventuate and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> attacks the US
                            with nuclear weapons, he believes this will be an all-out effort aimed
                            at putting a maximum number of weapons on US targets. He therefore
                            estimates that the number of heavy and medium bombers, including Badgers
                            on one-way missions, could exceed 500. See his footnote on page 32,
                            para. 94. [Footnote in the source text. This footnote on page 32
                            essentially repeats the information presented in this footnote.]</note>

                    <p>U. The Soviets will probably maintain sizable bomber forces, which will
                        decrease gradually through attrition and retirement. Although continued
                        Soviet work on advanced transports could be applied to military purposes, we
                        think it unlikely that the Soviets will bring any follow-on heavy bomber
                        into operational service during the period of this estimate. We believe that
                        Blinder medium bombers, some equipped with advanced air-to-surface missiles,
                        will be introduced during much of the period of this estimate. By mid-1970,
                        Long-Range Aviation will probably include some 140–180 heavy bombers of
                        present types and 300–500 mediums, mostly Blinders.<note n="7" xml:id="d55fn7">The Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, believes the Soviets will continue
                            to consider manned strategic aircraft an important adjunct to their
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. He estimates that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will introduce a follow-on
                            heavy bomber. He further estimates the heavy bomber force will remain at
                            about 200 or somewhat larger, depending on the timing of the expected
                            follow-on bomber, and that by mid-1970 the medium bomber/tanker force
                            will probably still include about 650–850 aircraft. See his footnote to
                            table on page 31 following para. 90. [Footnote in the source text. This

                    <p>V. Although the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> almost certainly is
                        investigating the feasibility of space systems for use as offensive and
                        defensive weapons, we have no evidence that a program to establish an
                        orbital bombardment capability is seriously contemplated by the Soviet
                        leadership. We think that orbital weapons will not compare favorably with
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s over the <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0192"/>next six years in terms of effectiveness,
                        reaction time, targeting flexibility, vulnerability, average life, and
                        positive control. In view of these considerations, the much greater cost of
                        orbital weapon systems, and Soviet endorsement of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution against nuclear weapons in space, we believe that
                        the Soviets are unlikely to develop and deploy an orbital weapon system
                        within the period of this estimate. (Paras. 98–103)</p>

                        <item>For any reasonably modernized state, and even for many of the less
                            developed nations, there are few obstacles in the way of acquiring at
                            least some <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> capability. The technology underlying <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> is
                            widely known or easily obtainable through open sources; the physical
                            facilities required to develop and produce agents are in great part
                            quite easily adaptable from existing chemical and pharmaceutical
                            facilities; the means of delivery comprise a wide range of conventional
                            weapons and even non-military equipment; and, overall, the costs are
                            relatively small, at least for an offensive capability appropriate to
                            most states’ conceivable needs. (Paras. 8–12)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>Yet despite these considerations, there is not now a trend toward the
                            proliferation of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> capabilities in the world. Such
                            proliferation could occur during the next few years, notably through a
                            snowballing process of mounting fear and suspicion, and of action and
                            reaction on the part of particular sets of adversaries among the middle
                            and smaller powers, but proliferation cannot now be judged likely.
                            (Paras. 17–24)</item>

                        <item>
                            <p>A number of factors work to restrain <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> proliferation.
                                The very fact that many states could achieve a capability with
                                relative ease gives these weapons the quality of a two-edge sword.
                                Prudence would dictate that countries deciding to acquire an
                                offensive or retaliatory capability should also undertake to develop
                                a defensive capability, and the requirements of doing so would add
                                to the price, almost prohibitively if adequate provision were made
                                for civilian needs. Most military doctrine on <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>, and even more so on <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss>, lays emphasis on the defensive aspects of the
                                problem, which is some evidence of a reluctance to be the first
                                user. And finally, there exists an almost universal popular moral
                                and psychological abhorrence of these forms of munitions, which adds
                                to official reluctance to contemplate their use. (Paras. 2–7,

                            believe may develop nuclear weapons in the next decade are India, and
                            perhaps Israel and Sweden. (Paras. 1, 19, 23, 26)</item>

                        <item>India’s decision as to whether to start a nuclear weapons program will
                            depend on its evaluation of a number of domestic and foreign factors
                            including the scope and pace of the Chinese program, any changes in
                            Sino-Soviet relations, and outside assurances. On balance, we believe
                            the chances are better than even that India will decide to develop
                            nuclear weapons within the next few years. India now has the basic
                            facilities necessary for a modest weapons program, including a plutonium
                            separation plant. India could produce by 1970 about a dozen weapons in
                            the 20 KT range. Thereafter, when reactor capacity is expected to
                            increase substantially, India’s ability to produce fissionable material
                            will increase proportionately. (Paras. 12–19)</item>

                        <item>In terms of broad international implications, the impact of the
                            proliferation which is already occurring—in France and Communist
                            China—will be far greater than the impact of the further proliferation
                            by smaller powers which we can foresee. In military terms, basic power
                            relationships between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                            US are not likely to be changed significantly. But the French and
                            Chinese nuclear programs will make relations within and between alliance
                            systems increasingly difficult in years to come. Communist China’s
                            recent detonation of its first nuclear device will have an important
                            impact throughout Asia, and in Southeast Asia will reinforce Chinese
                            efforts to achieve Asian hegemony through political pressures and
                            indirect support of local “wars of liberation.” (Paras. 45–46)</item>

                        <item>The military impact of proliferation among the smaller powers would
                            derive primarily from the possibility that more aggressive activities by
                            these states could lead to confrontations involving the major powers. US
                            and Soviet involvement in such crises could create the potential for
                            escalation, but both countries would have incentives to urge prudence
                            and caution on all parties. (Paras. 47–48)</item>

                        <item>The chances of unintentional or unauthorized explosion of nuclear
                            weapons will rise as the number of countries possessing them increases.
                            Although the odds are strongly against it, there is some possibility
                            that the accidental firing of a nuclear warhead into the territory <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0196"/>of one of the major powers
                            could touch off an immediate nuclear exchange. An accidental nuclear
                            explosion might, particularly if property and many lives were lost,
                            restrain some countries not involved in the accident from undertaking a
                            weapons program. In the country where the accident occurred, domestic
                            opposition might become strong enough to cause abandonment of a weapons
                            program already underway, as well as create intense pressure for the
                            withdrawal of any nuclear weapons stationed in the area by allied
                            nations. (Paras. 49–50)</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>
                    <p>A few weeks ago you asked me to examine and report to you personally on the
                        history of Air Force dissents to national intelligence estimates.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">This request has not been further identified.</note> The
                        examination resulted in the attached report,<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">The
                            attached report, which apparently includes Tabs B–E referenced below,
                            has not been found.</note> which I submit to you in complete confidence.
                        It indicates Air Force dissents have been numerous and, in recent years, far
                        exceeded the dissents of the Army, the Navy or <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The most disturbing issue, of course, has been the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s. You will note in Tab B that the Air
                        Force has consistently taken the position of crediting the Soviets with a
                        greater current and prospective capability than the other members of the
                        intelligence community. In retrospect the Air Force has been wrong though
                        the estimates have taken a somewhat downward trend in recent years. It is
                        interesting that in February, 1960 the Air Force estimated the Soviets would
                        have 250 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s in mid-61 and 800 in
                        mid-63. This is far above what actually occurred. Incidentally, the
                        community’s estimates of 140 to 200 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s
                        in mid-61 and 350 to 450 in mid-63 proved to be high. Again in August of
                        1960, the Air Force estimate of 950 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s
                        in mid-64 and 1200 in mid-65 is obviously high. In our most recent exercise
                        (October 8th, 1964), the Air Force was about 20% above the community with
                        respect to the current situation but I note that as they look into future
                        years they consistently project a greater capability than the accepted view
                        of the balance of the community.</p>
                    <p>With respect to heavy bombers, there have been consistent differences.
                        However I find that in July, 1962 the community, as indicated in Tab C,
                        lowered the estimate on Soviet Bisons and Bears. The Air Force dissented and
                        in this instance the Air Force appears to be correct, as the community
                        estimate was somewhat low. I think the community and Air Force views in this
                        area are now compatible.</p>
                    <p>Tab D sets forth an Air Force dissent on capabilities of the Soviet Theater
                        Forces. They here took the position that Soviet doctrine maintains that
                        nuclear weapons will play a dominant role in all phases of <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0198"/>a general war and that the initial phase of
                        such a war may be decisive. The Air Force dismisses the concept of a
                        non-nuclear war of substantial proportions.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the main trends in Soviet capabilities and policies (Tab E),
                        the community has concluded that the Soviet’s objective is the attainment of
                        a substantial deterrent and pre-emptive attack capabilities. The Air Force
                        dissents from this view and takes the position that the Soviet rulers are
                        endeavoring to attain at the earliest practical date a military superiority
                        over the United States which would be decisive.</p>
                    <p>There are other dissents relating to the introduction of new bombers, the
                        attitude toward nuclear propelled aircraft, which are of lesser importance
                        than the four mentioned above.</p>
                    <p>I wish you to handle this communication on a very personal basis as the
                        existence of the study would obviously create misunderstanding within the
                        community which might better be avoided.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. <persName>Howard</persName>:</p>
                    <p>Your letter of September 18, 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">Not
                            found.</note> requests the views of this Department on a proposed
                        Department of Defense Dispersal Plan for nuclear weapons in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′65 stockpile.</p>
                    <p>There are certain underlying aspects of nuclear weapons planning which the
                        Department of State considers it important to explore further with the
                        Department of Defense, in order to establish a more adequate basis for our
                        future appraisal of detailed dispersal plans such as this one. I have some
                        suggestions to this end below. For the present, in view of the wide variety
                        of pending action decisions which need to be made in connection with the
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′65 plan, the Department has no
                        objection to its being forwarded to the President.</p>
                    <p>I wish to make clear, however, that the Department of State does not concur
                        in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′65 planning figures shown for
                        support of non-U.S. forces with nuclear weapons. We consider this to be a
                        matter for subsequent and separate consideration, as indicated most recently
                        in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>’s letter of July 28,

                        remains our view that additional major dispersals of nuclear weapons in
                        support of non-U.S. forces should await joint State/Defense consideration of
                        the concept of tactical nuclear warfare in Europe, although we continue of
                        course to stand ready in exceptional circumstances to consider individual
                        dispersal actions pursuant to the provisions of <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 197.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">

                    <p>In this general connection, it is also the view of the Department of State

                            served as chairman of the Committee.</note> I am therefore proposing
                        that the following be considered at an early date by that group: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>If we are to share in meaningful recommendations to the President
                                on nuclear weapons questions of this sort, my present feeling is
                                that some earlier State participation in the whole process is
                                needed. Dealing with the final dispersal plan alone, as important as
                                this is, is not wholly adequate, since it touches only one
                                late-stage aspect—the parceling out of a total stockpile amount
                                which necessarily had to be agreed at a considerably earlier date.
                                One possibility I think should be considered would be for the
                                Department to comment from a foreign policy point of view on
                                proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′66 and subsequent
                                stockpile figures during the process of preparing a recommendation
                                to the President.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>

                                <p>As discussed above, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′65
                                    plan envisages a large increase over presently-authorized levels
                                    for nuclear support of non-U.S. members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The Department of State has
                                    previously taken exception to planned increases of this
                                    magnitude, pending joint consideration of a concept for tactical
                                    nuclear warfare which would put the proposed weapons support and
                                    our various commitments into some more meaningful context than
                                    presently exists. A continued piecemeal approach to this matter,
                                    under <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 197, is not
                                    satisfactory, except as a temporary expedient, and we consider
                                    it increasingly important that we come to an agreed national
                                    policy on tactical nuclear weapons in Europe as a basis <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0201"/>on which to decide

                                <p>I am of course aware that a number of studies have been and are
                                    now being conducted by various offices within the Department of
                                    Defense. Indeed we have had close and full association with many
                                    of these efforts, and this has been most helpful to us. What is
                                    still needed, however, is to press on until we have distilled a
                                    consensus within the Executive Branch on the vital policy issues
                                    underlying the potential employment of tactical nuclear weapons.
                                    Until that point is reached I do not believe we have adequate
                                    basis to make major decisions on further dispersal of such
                                    weapons in support of non-U.S. forces.</p>
                            </item>

                            <item>While our previous comments have been primarily directed toward
                                the question of nuclear support of non-U.S. forces, this is clearly
                                only a facet of the total problem, and we need therefore to address
                                continuing study to the inter-relationship of U.S. and non-U.S.
                                forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Europe as regards
                                nuclear weapons. With respect to the ADM question mentioned above,
                                for example, it would be helpful to know more about the concept and
                                planned mode of operation which underlay the dispersal of ADMs to
                                U.S. forces in Europe. This would undoubtedly have relevance to the
                                problem of ADMs for non-U.S. forces, especially since it is our
                                understanding that the ADMs for which dispersal to allied forces is
                                planned are being held for the present by U.S. theatre forces.
                                Circumstances and details undoubtedly differ with respect to other
                                present and planned weapons systems, and my only point here is to
                                emphasize that decisions on arming and equipping U.S. forces must be
                                reckoned with in terms of the possible effect on non-U.S. forces.
                                Thus, while we must of course continue to think in terms of the
                                concern expressed in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 305<note n="5" xml:id="d60fn5">

                                    Security File, National Security Action Memoranda)</note> about
                                growth of excessive stockpiles abroad in support of non-U.S. forces,
                                it is unrealistic to think solely in those terms, since the problem
                                of nuclear weapons for allied forces cannot be dealt with in
                                isolation, and any continued buildup of nuclear support for U.S.
                                forces obviously increases political and other pressures for similar
                                treatment for allied forces. One great merit of the national policy
                                on tactical nuclear weapons in Europe to which I refer above is that
                                it would serve as a background against which to make decisions in
                                this area as required, whether U.S. or non-U.S. forces are
                                involved.</item>

                                        nevertheless continue to feel that there should be a delay
                                        in the decision whether to proceed with the Project
                                        Definition Phase, I then recommend that you reconsider the
                                        two-year moratorium proposed in your memorandum. The
                                        advantages inherent in increased dispersal and in the speed
                                        of <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> as compared to the
                                        B–52, and the <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0203"/>smaller tanker requirement of <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> in relation to a strategic version of the
                                        F–111, appear to me to weigh in favor of a new manned
                                        bomber, while recognizing the economies apparent in a
                                            B–52/<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> combination.
                                        Considering the uncertainties regarding extension of the
                                        life of the B–52 until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                        1975 or beyond, and the estimated ten-year interval from
                                        go-ahead on <gloss target="#t_PDP1">PDP</gloss> to
                                        attainment of a 200 <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>
                                        force, it would appear desirable to go ahead in the near
                                        future with a decision to proceed with the Project
                                        Definition Phase in order to keep a timely option, and
                                        minimize the risk of a temporary degradation of our manned
                                        bomber capability. Pending such a decision, I recommend that
                                        advanced avionics and propulsion development be expedited,
                                        that the prerequisite phase proposed by the Air Force be
                                        completed as soon as practicable and that the decision with
                                        respect to initiating the formal Project Definition Phase be
                                        made at that time.</p>

                                    <p>As indicated in your memorandum for the President, even with
                                        a $30 billion balanced damage limiting program, U.S.
                                        fatalities associated with an early urban attack would be
                                        very heavy. I believe we should take every reasonable step
                                        to ensure that we maintain a substantially greater assured
                                        destruction capability than the Soviets. I am concerned by
                                        the effect upon our relative superiority if we reduce the
                                        previously approved Minuteman force from 1200 to 1000, with
                                        a substantial impact being felt in the early years, and also
                                        phase out many of our Atlas and Titan missiles. I concur
                                        with your recommendation to phase out Atlas and Titan-I by
                                        the end of this fiscal year provided we retain the
                                        previously approved Minuteman program, with as many as
                                        practicable of the added 200 being scheduled in the next two
                                        years. My views in this regard are influenced by the greater
                                        hardness of Minuteman as compared to all of these missiles,
                                        the reduced time required for launch of Minuteman, and doubt
                                        as to whether Atlas-F will be capable of demonstrating
                                        adequate reliability in the operational test program in a
                                        reasonable time prior to retirement. The $515 million saving
                                        as a result of the Atlas and Titan-I phase-out should
                                        provide an appreciable portion of the funds required for the
                                        additional 200 Minuteman missiles.</p>

                                    <p>Although a balanced defense requires a major reorientation of
                                        our effort, I believe we should avoid significant reduction
                                        of our present over-all capability against the Soviet manned
                                        bomber threat until that threat is appreciably reduced. A
                                        shift of funds and effort from less effective to improved
                                        systems is desirable, but should be accomplished without
                                        significant drop in total capability. <list>

                                                recognizing the possibility that by outflanking our
                                                warning systems Soviet bombers could deliver many
                                                megatons more quickly following their missile
                                                attack. It would appear that this risk is limited by
                                                current utilization of <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> airborne radar resources to perform
                                                random patrols, and that increased utilization could
                                                reduce the risk further. The calculated risk
                                                involved emphasizes the need for expediting improved
                                                warning systems such as over-the-horizon radar and

                                                evidence that the anticipated 1967 reduction in the
                                                Soviet bomber is a fact, or sufficient numbers of
                                                either the F–12A or an interceptor version of the
                                                F–111 are available to cope with the threat. With

                                    <p>Recent studies establish the need for balanced strategic
                                        offensive and defensive forces. At the present time, we have
                                        relatively strong <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0205"/>strategic offensive forces and also weapon systems for
                                        defense against the Soviet manned bomber. However, until
                                        such time as we establish an anti-ballistic missile
                                        capability, we cannot attain any semblance of a balance in
                                        our offensive and defensive forces. The existing lack of
                                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense warrants the
                                        inclusion of approximately $200 million for preproduction
                                        funding in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966
                                        budget, in order to begin to attain this capability at the
                                        earliest practicable time. In my judgment, this production
                                        decision should not be delayed for a year because of the
                                        existence of uncertainties concerning the preferred concept
                                        of its deployment, the relationship of Nike X to other
                                        elements of a balanced damage-limiting effort, the prospects
                                        for the fallout shelter system, or uncertainties concerning
                                        possible Soviet reaction to our improving our defensive

                                    <p>As indicated in the draft memorandum for the President, an
                                        effective nation-wide fallout shelter program would provide
                                        a high return for the money expended. This program offers
                                        defense against either bomber or missile attack and could
                                        reduce rural fatalities by over fifty per cent. In view of
                                        this relatively economical means of saving approximately
                                        twenty-two per cent of the total population, I do not
                                        believe we should restrict the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 funding for this program to the limited
                                        amount recommended in the draft memorandum. In my opinion,
                                        the Defense Department, with Executive Branch support,
                                        should lead the major effort to convince the Congress of the
                                        need for this program. I urge that the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 budget contain provision
                                        for the required development and for the maximum practicable
                                        support of construction necessary to provide fallout
                                        shelters for the entire population.</p>

                            well justified for our national security.</item>

                    <p>I appreciate your sending me a copy of the 1964 Report of the Net Evaluation
                        Subcommittee of the National Security Council.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">The full report has not been found; a revised staff draft of Section V
                            (Conclusions and Recommendations), June 26, is enclosed with a
                            memorandum from General <persName>Leon W. Johnson</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, June 26. (Central

                    </p>
                    <p>There are some findings of the report on which I should like to comment.
                        First, I agree completely that political and psychological factors will be
                        important, and in some situations may be determining, in the decisions to
                        release nuclear weapons. It is for this reason that I have always felt that
                        we need not only a wide range of options, but also effective means for
                        exercising initial and continuing control by the President, over the use of
                        all types of nuclear weapons. I believe it would be helpful, if it has not
                        already been done, to brief the President on what can and cannot be
                        accomplished with existing systems and procedures in exercising selective
                        control over the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. We should then
                        seek means of remedying deficiencies in pres-ent control systems.</p>
                    <p>Second, I was impressed by the description of the restrictions of <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s flexibility in the use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in limited aggression situations.
                        I concur in the judgment that “situations may arise in which the risk
                        inherent in degrading <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s general war
                        posture in Europe is more than offset by the advantages of bringing decisive
                        conventional forces to bear in a limited conflict.” While we must exercise
                        considerable care to avoid the impression among our allies that we are
                        prepared to contemplate a World War II conventional hostility limited to
                        Europe, or that we would not carry out our nuclear commitments, it is
                        important that we place our emphasis on the more likely sort of
                        contingencies, with the expectation that in time our allies will agree with
                        the wisdom of such action. This suggests that <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> should prepare, by the way of planning or training, more
                        than he has in the past for contingencies in which some degrading of his
                        general war posture is permitted by higher authority in order to cope with a
                        limited conflict. In particular, I <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0207"/>would hope additional effort would be directed at the problem of
                        unpremeditated conflict arising from the present unsettled situation in
                        Central Europe. I understand that this, and other ideas to improve <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss>’s capabilities for situations less
                        than general war are under continuing discussions among Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>. I hope that we will be able to reach a
                        considered judgment about this matter at an early date.</p>
                    <p>Third, I fully endorse the position that there should be continuing
                        inter-agency work on improving our crisis management capability, to include
                        a timely development of contingency plans identifying the politico-military
                        courses of action in anticipation of a crisis. Pursuant to an exchange of
                        correspondence between the Secretary of Defense and me, we have established
                        a small senior level coordinating committee precisely to fill this need. (A
                        copy of that correspondence is attached for your information.)<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">Not found.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fourth, I am entirely in accord with the suggestion that there should be
                        close State-Defense collaboration in developing the portions of the <gloss target="#t_JSCP1">JSCP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>
                        having to do with national and military objectives and strategic concepts. I
                        suggest that our staffs discuss soon how this might most effectively be
                        done. In this connection, I assure you that we will make every effort to
                        avoid creating delays in the <gloss target="#t_JSCP1">JSCP</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss> timetables as a result of
                        Department of State participation.</p>

                    <p>This is in response to your memorandum of November twentieth to Ambassador

                    </p>
                    <p>May I take this occasion, as I have in the past, to state my profound
                        admiration for the outstanding success you have had in bringing conceptual
                        clarity to the presentation of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> military
                        programs and budgets. I have found once again this year in reviewing the
                        draft Memoranda to the President a highly impressive exposition of US
                        military programs and objectives. However, partly as a result of the
                        complexity and volume of the material, and partly as a result of my
                        involvement in other pressing matters, I will limit my substantive comments
                        at this time to two particular draft memoranda leaving open the possibility

                        date.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the role of tactical nuclear forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strategy, I feel that your memorandum
                        blocks out for the first time the beginning of a rational conceptualization
                        of the role of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. I do, however, have the
                        following observations to make: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>It seems to me of vital importance that we turn our attention to
                                the consideration of the utility and limitation of the potential
                                utilization of tactical nuclear weaponry in other areas of the
                                globe. I particularly have in mind the Far East where we maintain
                                the second largest overseas nuclear arsenal and where, insofar as
                                Southeast Asia is concerned the prospect for a major US military
                                involvement cannot be overlooked. While I appreciate the fact that
                                various studies have been conducted <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0209"/>from time to time on the role of nuclear weapons in
                                the Far East and Southeast Asia, I would like to suggest that an
                                analytical technique similar to that contained in your October
                                twenty-sixth draft Memorandum to the President which deals
                                exclusively with Europe,<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">Not
                                    found.</note> be applied to the Far East. If you believe it
                                feasible, such an effort might be included within the studies to be
                                conducted by the Special Studies Group of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                as proposed in your draft Memorandum to the President. However,
                                whether this or some alternative solution is favored by you, I would
                                be prepared to make available Department of State personnel to
                                participate in such a study which I believe should be conducted on a
                                relatively urgent basis.</item>

                            <item>With regard to the European portion of the problem, which is so
                                extensively treated in your draft memorandum, I believe that you and
                                I are in essential agreement on the limitations which attach to
                                existing strategic posture as well as to the political implications
                                which would be involved in any major and precipitant change. I think
                                the central political feature is the one which you identify in your
                                paper, namely that our allies’ declaratory policy is for a variety
                                of reasons closely wedded to reliance on nuclear deterrence. How
                                much confidence one may have in the assumption that our allies’
                                declaratory policy would be effectively implemented once war was
                                initiated is, as you so correctly point out, open to serious
                                question. What is not open to serious question, however, is that our
                                allies strongly adhere to this position and any attempt to move them
                                gradually toward increased reliance on a major conventional defense,
                                which you suggest, will require a combination of persistence and
                                patience which will call for our best efforts. I, therefore, endorse
                                your proposal for a joint State-Defense developed program to
                                prescribe manner, pacing and tactics; I believe this can be
                                accomplished as a logical extension of the work of the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> Strategy Group.<note n="5" xml:id="d63fn5">See <ref target="#d60fn5">footnote 5,

                    <p>With regard to your memorandum on Strategic Forces, I should like to make the
                        following observations: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>Your analysis of the effect of US strategic missile capability
                                above that required for “assured destruction” concludes that a 200
                                missile reduction in the Minuteman program is acceptable. (We assume
                                that target procurement figures cast two or three years ahead are
                                provisional and subject to review in the light of what the Soviet
                                Union is doing.) What is not entirely clear from your memorandum is
                                the effect which such a reduction would have upon damage limitation
                                in Western Europe. I can readily imagine that the result would be
                                negligible; nevertheless, having repeatedly assured the Europeans
                                that US forces cover <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0210"/>targets threatening Western Europe with approximately the same
                                priority as those which threaten the US, we have assumed the
                                obligation to demonstrate that we have in fact considered their
                                interests. Especially in view of the fact that this proposal is
                                likely to receive considerable publicity, during Congressional
                                testimony if not before, I would like to be assured that in fact
                                your analysis does demonstrate that the 200 missiles involved in the
                                reduction, if procured and targetted against threats to Western
                                Europe, would make no appreciable difference in a damage limiting
                                sense. If this cannot be demonstrated, I believe you and I should
                                consider the matter further. However, even if it can be
                                demonstrated, I think it is of vital importance that the case be
                                developed in whatever detail required in anticipation of our having
                                to make the case to our allies on the assumption that they will
                                learn of the proposed reduction. I would appreciate receiving your
                                views on this matter at your earliest convenience.</item>

                            <item>I was not able to determine whether your projected 200 missile
                                Minuteman reduction was based on a force availability which assumed
                                existence of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> or made the
                                contrary assumption. (The two charts in your memorandum appear
                                contradictory on this point.) This is a factual question we should
                                try to clear up before the proposed Minuteman reduction becomes
                                public since it has obvious implications both in terms of
                                Congressional presentation and foreign consideration of the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> proposal.</item>

                            <item>With regard to the <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> missile,
                                it strikes me that it is important, particularly at this stage of
                                our negotiations with our European allies on alliance nuclear
                                arrangements, to avoid giving an erroneous impression that the US is
                                re-launching itself upon the development of a Skybolt-type of
                                missile. While I do not anticipate that there should be problems,
                                given the clear technical differences between the <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> and the Skybolt, nevertheless
                                this distinction might initially be overlooked. It seems to me
                                prompt joint State-Defense preparation is called for: (i) to develop
                                a public presentation program designed to minimize misunderstanding
                                on the part of our allies as to the relationship (or lack thereof)
                                between the <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> and Skybolt and
                                (ii) to develop a US position in anticipation of the fact that the
                                British and/or the French may express an interest in securing the
                                new missile once its projected availability becomes known.</item>

                            <item>Perhaps the most complicated issue in your Strategic Forces
                                Memorandum deals with the question of anti-ballistic missile
                                programs. Indeed, I take it, it is in deference to these
                                complexities that you have decided to postpone for another year the
                                decision on deployment of this system. I have expressed to you in
                                past years my very considerable interest in the question of an
                                anti-ballistic missile weapons system. <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0211"/>I will not repeat my arguments, but I will say that
                                I continue to feel that the possibility of developing a
                                technologically feasible, as well as reasonably economic defense
                                against ballistic missiles is a matter of immense political import.
                                It has implications which extend to the nature of our alliance
                                system as well as to future relations with the Soviet Union and
                                secondary nuclear powers. In view of the fact that if your
                                recommendation is accepted we will have delayed for one year the
                                basic decision on deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, I think it vitally important that State and
                                Defense enter into an urgent joint study of the various political
                                implications associated with a decision to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. If you would designate a
                                point of contact with whom we might deal on this matter, we will
                                take the initiative in seeing that the issues which concern us are
                                identified in such a way as to permit them to be given appropriate
                                consideration as an integral part of the development of next year’s
                                Five Year Force Structure memorandum on this subject.</item>
                            <label>e.</label>
                            <item>Finally, there are several specific and for the most part probably
                                minor issues which relate to the Strategic Forces Memorandum which
                                we would like to pursue at an early date. For example, reference is
                                made to the prospective requirement for additional facilities in
                                Turkey and Iran. This is a matter we would like to pursue with your
                                staff to gain a fuller understanding of what you have in mind. Also,
                                as a strictly non-substantive problem, I would like to propose that
                                the title of your Strategic Forces Memorandum be changed from
                                “Strategic Offensive and Defensive Forces” to “Strategic Retaliatory
                                and Defensive Forces.” This is simply reverting to the terminology
                                of previous years. However, I feel that from a political point of
                                view your earlier terminology had some distinct advantages in
                                avoiding a connotation which could have unfavorable political
                                implications. On these and other similarly minor specific points, I
                                will have my staff contact your Comptroller staff with whom they
                                have been working over the past year.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I might say in this latter regard, that I am deeply appreciative of the very
                        excellent cooperation which your entire Comptroller staff, and in particular
                        Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EAC1">Enthoven</persName>, has accorded us. As a
                        result of your staff’s effort, I believe our understanding and appreciation
                        of the problems identified in your Five Year Force Structure Memoranda has
                        been immeasurably enhanced.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>In my memorandum of September 16, 1964, referring to the <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss> report of August 31, 1964, to the President
                        on “Civil Emergency Preparedness”,<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">See <ref target="#d48">Document 48</ref>.</note> I indicated our intention to
                        work closely with you on specific programs. One of these programs, included
                        in the five-year projection, to which the President has given approval, is
                        directed at correction of deficiencies in arrangements for headquarters
                        emergency operating facilities.</p>
                    <p>This program has been developed, conceptually, in accordance with criteria
                        provided by the Emergency Planning Committee (EPC) in its initial report
                        which was approved by the President. The Committee concluded that maximum

                        and that protected emergency sites be provided within 15 to 35 miles from
                        the White House. These sites are to be used day-to-day by organizational
                        units related to emergency activities, including at least one individual who
                        could act for the department or agency in an emergency.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State has been selected for inclusion in the first year’s
                        increment of the program. This determination is based on the importance of
                        the mission of the Department and the fact that the Department does not have
                        an emergency facility of its own. It is contemplated that the State
                        Department site will also accommodate small emergency units of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and the Export-Import Bank.</p>

                        increase our over-all combat effectiveness and will provide effective forces
                        in a high state of readiness for defense of the vital interests of the
                        United States. Tab B lists specific comments of the Chiefs on my

                                Advisor is not convinced that the development of this new, large

                                more roll-on roll-off ships are constructed and used as forward

                                additional airlift is also needed and that it can be supplied most
                                economically by developing the CX–(HLS). I recommend that we include

                        statement last year would be about $250 million.</p>

                            budget for consideration at the meeting with you tomorrow at 12:45 p.m.
                            This is the only vital paper for tomorrow, and the most important stuff
                            is in the first 2 pages. The views of the Chiefs on all aspects of the
                            budget are summarized in Tab B to this memo,<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">See <ref target="#d65fn3">footnote 3, Document 65</ref>.</note> and
                            Bob hopes you will read them.</item>

                        <item>The Defense budget is in extremely good shape and there are really no
                            major items seriously at issue. The four items in the memorandum are by
                            their nature difficult problems that by common agreement are being
                            called to your attention. I understand, however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GK3">Gordon</persName> and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> are in general satisfied with
                            the solutions suggested in the memorandum and there should not be a very
                            extended discussion on these items.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>There are a number of major actions involved in the current budget
                            that are not reflected in the attached memorandum since they are not in
                            dispute. These issues include the following: the reduction in the
                            Minuteman force, the decision not to go ahead with an advanced manned
                            bomber, the decision not to deploy an anti-ballistic missile system, the
                            decision not to proceed with an advanced manned interceptor, the
                            decision to eliminate the “shelter incentive” plan from the civil
                            defense program, the decision to eliminate the MMRBM, and the decision
                            to go ahead with a deep underground command and control center for the
                            Pentagon and the White House. I am attaching for your information at Tab
                            2 a background paper on recommended strategic offensive and defensive
                            forces that covers these and other issues.<note n="4" xml:id="d66fn4">Not attached, but presumably a lengthy December 3 draft memorandum

                        <item>Since 1961 we have increased the number of weapons on alert threefold
                            and alert megatonnage more than threefold. We have now reached a plateau
                            both in weapons and megatons, with future planned reductions in bombers
                            offset by increases in missiles. Our remaining bomber/tanker forces in

                            (a) that they prefer an ultimate force of 1200 Minuteman missiles
                            instead of the 1000 we have recommended—if next year it seems desirable
                            to increase the number of Minuteman missiles from 1000 to 1200, we have
                            the option to do so; and (b) the Chiefs also recommend a faster rate of

                        four years has gone into the increase in the number and strength of Army
                        combat ready divisions and Air Force tactical fighter wings. The latter are
                        now being equipped with F–4s and in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966
                        we will make our first large procurement of the F–111 (TFX).</p>

                    <p>We are planning to reduce the number of carriers from 15 to 14 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 and to 13 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. This reduction is already being reflected in our

                        reduction in the number of the tactical carriers. They approve the tactical
                        air force program except that the Chief of Staff, Army and the Chief of
                        Naval Operations believe that 21 wings would be adequate as contrasted with
                        the 24 we are programming. They recommend building six nuclear attack

                    <p>1. We have greatly increased the totally inadequate strategic airlift which
                        we possessed in 1961. We are beginning to receive deliveries of operational
                            <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>-141s, the new jet transport plane. We
                        now propose to initiate development of a new, much larger, and more
                        economical transport jet plane known as the CX(HLS). If we procure only the
                        three squadrons of CX(HLS) now programmed, we will increase our 30-day
                        airlift to Southeast Asia from 15,000 tons in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 to 79,000 tons in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1970 and to 89,000 tons in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971.</p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur with these recommendations. We plan to
                        further increase the strategic mobility of our forces by starting
                        construction in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 of four fast forward

                        and to forecast probable trends in Soviet air and missile defense programs
                        through mid-1970.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. The combination of area and point defenses provided by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s present force of interceptors and
                        short-range surface-to-air missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>)
                        systems affords a good defense for major target areas against medium and
                        high altitude bomber attacks. However, the air defense system has limited
                        low altitude capabilities, and special difficulties are posed by supersonic
                        aircraft and air-to-surface missiles (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">ASM</gloss>s).
                        We believe that a major Soviet effort during the remainder of this decade
                        will be focused on meeting these particular problems. (Para. 55)</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0221"/>
                    <p>B. We believe that improvements in the Soviet air defense system over the
                        next few years will make progressively more difficult successful penetration
                        by manned bombers to major target areas. Successful penetration by manned
                        bombers will require increasingly sophisticated forms of attack. Soviet air
                        defense capabilities can be degraded by the increasingly complex forms of
                        attack which the West will be able to employ, including air-launched
                        missiles, penetration tactics, electronic countermeasures, and low-altitude
                        attack. Despite these limitations of their air defense system, the Soviets
                        would expect to destroy a number of the attackers. We doubt, however, that
                        they would be confident that they could reduce the weight of attack to a
                        point where the resulting damage to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be acceptable. (Para. 57)</p>
                    <p>C. There are critical uncertainties in our knowledge of Soviet <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> and deployment in the antiballistic
                        missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) field. From the evidence now
                        available, however, certain general conclusions can be drawn: first, the
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort has been extensive and
                        of long duration, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> several
                        years ago probably solved the technical problem of intercepting ballistic
                        targets arriving singly or in small numbers; second, some initial <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment activity was probably begun as
                        long ago as 1960, but both the deployment and <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> programs were evidently interrupted and modified;
                        third, the magnitude of <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> and the
                        probable early deployment activity point to a strong Soviet desire to obtain
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses rapidly; fourth, <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> continues, a new antimissile missile
                            (<gloss target="#t_AMM1">AMM</gloss>) has appeared, and some additional
                        deployment activity may now be underway, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> does not have any operational defenses against strategic
                        ballistic missiles today. (Para. 58)</p>
                    <p>D. Much of our evidence indicates that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been exploring methods of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense which differ in important respects from those now
                        favored by the US. Low frequency radars may play an important role in the
                        Soviet program. An early Soviet effort may have involved a missile designed
                        to have dual capabilities against ballistic and aerodynamic vehicles. The
                        new <gloss target="#t_AMM1">AMM</gloss> which was recently displayed by the
                        Soviets is probably designed to conduct exoatmospheric intercepts at
                        considerable ranges, using a large nuclear warhead to achieve its kill. We
                        believe, however, that the Soviets have probably not conducted many <gloss target="#t_AMM1">AMM</gloss> firings to exoatmospheric altitudes, and
                        that they have probably not attempted full system tests involving
                        interceptions at these altitudes. (Paras. 37–42, 59)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Recent Defensive Deployments</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>E. The Soviets began construction of three defensive complexes at Leningrad
                        in 1960–1961. We believe that the Leningrad system was originally designed
                        to have a capability against ballistic missiles, and perhaps against
                        aerodynamic vehicles as well. However, we believe <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0222"/>that the initial design has been changed.
                        We cannot determine the nature of this change, or whether it was caused by
                        serious technical difficulties, a realization that the system was vulnerable
                        to penetration aids, or important new developments in the state-of-the art.
                        There are similarities between new construction at one of the Leningrad
                        complexes and two recently discovered defensive complexes under construction
                        in northwestern <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In light of these
                        similarities, at least these three complexes may now be intended for the
                        deployment of the same defensive system. (Paras. 46–47)</p>
                    <p>F. We are unable to associate the new complexes with any systems equipment,
                        and any explanation for the mission of these complexes and the modified
                        Leningrad complex is open to some doubt. There is some support for the
                        belief that the complexes are for a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                        system to defend against aerodynamic vehicles. On the other hand, we have
                        noted intensive Soviet research on missile defenses for several years and
                        indications that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been working
                        toward new and different <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities.
                        In light of this factor and other considerations, we think there are also
                        persuasive reasons for believing that the new complexes are related to
                        missile defense. However, any judgment at this time on their mission is in
                        our view premature. (Paras. 47, 50)</p>
                    <p>G. We have observed at Moscow three developments which may indicate <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment there. A large radar now under
                        construction could be the acquisition and early target tracking element of
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Other facilities also under
                        construction could serve as the final target tracking and missile guidance
                        element. SA–1 sites which are now being modified could be used as the <gloss target="#t_AMM1">AMM</gloss> launch positions for the systems. However,
                        the activities we have observed thus far may not be related, and some of
                        them may represent improvements in Moscow’s defense against aerodynamic
                        vehicles or serve a space function. The missile to be employed is a major
                        unknown; the recently displayed <gloss target="#t_AMM1">AMM</gloss> could be
                        used at Moscow to conduct exoatmospheric intercepts of ballistic missiles,
                        perhaps at distances of several hundreds of miles from the city. In sum, we
                        continue to believe that the Soviets may be deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses at Moscow, but we do not yet
                        understand how the installations we have observed would function as an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. (Paras. 41, 51–54)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> Prospects</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>H. If <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment activity is now underway
                        at either Moscow or the other locations we have noted, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to have some initial strategic
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses operational within the next
                        two years or so. Limited deployment, especially at Moscow, could be a
                        special, highest-priority effort to defend the Soviet capital with an early
                        and still unproved system. But widespread <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment activity, whenever <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0223"/>it occurred, would imply that the Soviets consider their
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems good enough to justify
                        extraordinarily large new expenditures. It would indicate that the Soviets
                        had achieved excellent <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> successes, and
                        perhaps, that they had taken high-risk production and deployment decisions.
                        We cannot exclude this possibility, but our evidence suggests that the
                        Soviets have been proceeding cautiously since they modified their program.
                        (Paras. 60–61)</p>
                    <p>I. In considering whether to provide <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        defenses for many of their urban-industrial centers and other targets, the
                        Soviet leaders will have to weigh the great cost of such an effort against
                        the likely effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems
                        available. Area defenses might offer considerable savings over point
                        defenses, but we cannot be sure of this and in any event a major commitment
                        of resources would be required. The Soviets may defer widespread deployment
                        pending further <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> work on existing
                        systems, or in the hope of achieving better systems at a later date. They
                        might even decide that the cost of large-scale <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment would not be commensurate with the protection it
                        could offer against anticipated Western strike capabilities. We are certain
                        that the Soviets will push ahead with their <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort, but we cannot forecast whether or when they
                        will achieve <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems with capabilities
                        and costs justifying widespread deployment. (Para. 62)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Antisatellite Capabilities</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>J. We believe that the Soviets are now constructing a series of large, new
                        radars, most of which will probably be completed in 1966. We believe that
                        some or all of these radars will be linked together as a space surveillance
                        system. Such a system will, we think, have a capability considerably in
                        excess of that required merely to detect the passage of US space vehicles.
                        In our view, the chances are better than even that the Soviets intend to
                        provide themselves, not only with a space surveillance system, but with an
                        antisatellite capability as well.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">The Director of

                            basis of available evidence, this affirmative judgment is premature.
                            While he does not exclude the antisatellite function as a possibility,
                            present evidence does not persuade him that the Soviets intend to
                            develop and deploy within the next two years and at great cost an
                            extremely complex antisatellite system. [Footnote in the source

                        flight tests began. (Paras. 63–66)</p>

                    <p>In the absence of the Secretary and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>, I am responding to your letter of December 8,
                            1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">
                            <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.</note> concerning emergency
                        operating facilities for the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>We are aware of the fact that our use of the Special Facility as an
                        operational relocation site is contrary to the intended purpose of that
                        installation. Consequently, we welcome your decision to include this
                        Department’s requirements in the initial phase of the recently approved
                        five-year plan for providing protected emergency sites around the perimeter
                        of the National Capital area. Pending the completion and occupancy of an
                        alternative facility, we assume, of course, that there will be no change in
                        current arrangements with respect to the availability of the Special
                        Facility for our emergency operations.</p>
                    <p>Since this project will require major contributions from our management and
                        budget staffs, we believe that our Bureau of Administration should
                        participate actively in both its preliminary planning and developmental
                        stages. Accordingly, Mr. <persName>Richard R. Brown</persName>, Special
                        Assistant to the Assistant Secretary for Administration, as well as Joseph
                        F. Vaughn of my staff, will be available for necessary consultation with
                        your representatives.</p>
                    <p>We are most appreciative of the consideration which your Office and its
                        predecessors have given to the emergency operational requirements of the
                        Department of State.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>The main subject of this meeting was the Defense Department budget.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> opened the meeting with
                        a statement that the major issues have been considered and that the
                        Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are agreed on about 95%
                        of the items. Each Chief was then invited to discuss points he would like to
                        bring up.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">A December 17 memorandum to Secretary

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> listed three points
                        which he considered a “package”—the Strategic Missile Force, the Fallout
                        Shelter Program, and the Antiballistic Missile Program. He stated that he
                        was concerned about the reduction from 1200 to 1000 Minutemen in this
                        budget, especially since it is coming at the time we are phasing out<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">The word “Minuteman,” immediately following this
                            word was crossed out and initialed by <persName corresp="#p_CCV1">Clifton</persName>.</note> Atlas and Titan missiles.</p>
                    <p>There was an interruption and discussion of a telephone call to Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concerning Viet
                        Nam.</p>
                    <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0226"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> gave a rather lengthy
                        explanation of why he felt we could delay the decision on the 200 extra
                        Minutemen missiles.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> then spoke of the
                        national fallout shelter program and his feeling that it should be speeded
                        up if we are going to make our whole strategic force compatible with the
                        protection of our own people. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> generally agreed with his point but stated that he
                        felt that pushing ahead on civil defense while not pushing ahead with the
                        antiballistic missile might not be of any great value. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> then pressed on with further
                        support for the antiballistic missile and a proposal for $200 million for
                        preproduction funding. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        made other statements which confirmed his view that the fallout shelter
                        program and the antiballistic defense program should go together and that we
                        are not ready at the moment to go ahead with either of these programs any
                        more strongly than we are.</p>
                    <p>During the time that the President left the meeting, General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed post-D-Day aid to
                        allies and the military assistance program as well as the military sales
                        program. General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> discussed
                        Marine Corps Organized Reserves with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                    <p>At 1058 President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> rejoined the
                        conference and General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                        continued his discussion. He made a strong plea for raising military pay
                        this year. There was a lengthy discussion between President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and other Chiefs on the pay
                        situation. All of the Chiefs joined in on this subject and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> told the President that
                        he would sit down with the Chiefs and examine the matter so all of them are
                        talking on the same basis. There was a further discussion between General
                            <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on Congressman Rivers presenting a
                        pay bill that they would have to testify about.</p>
                    <p>In concluding this matter, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that he would very carefully consider any
                        recommendations from the Secretary of Defense and would discuss them with
                        the Director of the Budget.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMCE1">LeMay</persName> then added a few words
                        on the pay situation and reiterated the fact that there should be funds for
                        the Project Definition Phase of the manned bomber and an improved
                        interceptor for the Air Defense Command. He feels that the time lag is too
                        long. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
                        it was the Chiefs’ view that it is too early to say that we don’t need a new
                        bomber and it is too early to say that we do need one. The Chiefs say that
                        we should work on advanced engines, avionics, and Project Definition Phase.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that his
                        proposal would only delay this decision by five months.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> then spoke about
                        ship force levels, stating that antisubmarine warfare ships were short in
                        the building program. The second point was gunfire support in connection
                        with amphibious landing <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0227"/>capabilities, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then agreed to put two additional rocket ships into
                        the shipbuilding program.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> then led a
                        discussion on the replacement of major escort ships. General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> then discussed the Marine Corps
                        Organized Reserves at mobilization time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that there were problems here but they
                        needed to be sorted out. General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> then spoke about the fine equipment that we have in
                        Viet Nam and out in the Far East and that the Army is doing well. This led
                        to a discussion of the pay system, and finally General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> made a request for some more money
                        for the Nike X.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> adjourned the
                        meeting at 1252.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The only positive decision I saw was the
                        addition of two extra rocket ships and the determination that the Secretary
                        of Defense should come forth with new recommendations on military pay.</p>
                    <p>The other problem areas that are open for further discussion are the manned
                        bomber, the advanced manned interceptor; General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>’s “strategic package”: Minuteman missiles, fallout
                        shelters and the antiballistic missile; the Navy shipbuilding program of new

                    <p>As part of a continuing effort to increase the efficiency and quality of
                        various study programs, I have for some time questioned the value <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0228"/>of continuing the work of the Net
                        Evaluation Subcommittee (<gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>) of the
                        National Security Council (established by <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5816).<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Regarding <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5816, July 1, 1958, see <ref target="frus1958-60v03#pg_118">

                    </p>
                    <p>When the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> was established by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in 1958, neither the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff Organization nor the Office of the Secretary of
                        Defense included a capability for performing the type of study assigned to
                        the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>. The original directive charged
                        the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> with providing “integrated
                        evaluations of the net capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, in the event of general war, to inflict direct injury
                        upon the Continental United States and to provide a continual watch for
                        changes which would significantly alter those net capabilities.” Subsequent
                        directives have altered this task on an annual basis. For example, the most
                        recently completed <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> study was an
                        evaluation of a “war conducted in 1964 between the U.S., its Allies, and the
                        Soviet Bloc based on current U.S. war plans.”<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d62fn2">footnote 2, Document 62</ref>.</note> Further,
                        the over-all purpose of the report was to “evaluate the validity and
                        feasibility of this type of analysis as a basis for providing guidance for
                        political-military planning. …”</p>
                    <p>Having studied the 1964 Report, I do not feel that a brief survey of this
                        type qualifies as a basis for planning guidance. As a broad survey of the
                        problem, it is not without merit; but our strategic planning today is
                        increasingly based upon more detailed studies of specific problem areas,
                        such as those included on the Secretary of Defense’s annual “Project List”
                        and other studies conducted by the Joint Staff and military departments.</p>
                    <p>For example, the Special Studies Group (<gloss target="#t_SSG1">SSG</gloss>)
                        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has developed a broader base of expertise than
                        that of the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> staff. Both groups have
                        explored similar issues, used the same sources of input, obtained the same
                        computer support and have performed the same type of analysis. Because of
                        the close relationship of strategic studies to forces, the budget, and other
                        on-going Defense Department studies, the usefulness of the <gloss target="#t_SSG1">SSG</gloss> studies has been understandably greater
                        than the annual survey of the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The economy involved in eliminating a major study group is obvious. We can, I
                        feel, make better use of our limited study skills while simultaneously
                        improving the product delivered to the consumer. Participation in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> studies by other government agencies is, of
                        course, welcomed when warranted by the subject matter. Similarly, we remain
                        responsive to requests for study reports from other interested agencies of
                        the government.</p>
                    <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0229"/>
                    <p>In summary, while the annual study program of the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> had value and relevance in 1958, its contribution today is
                        marginal when compared to the battery of specific studies which have become
                        major functions of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> during the intervening years. It therefore
                        appears logical to terminate the requirement for the <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>. Attached is a draft implementing
                        directive for signature.<note n="4" xml:id="d72fn4">This undated draft

                                    obscure but it is obvious the Soviets are pursuing qualitative

                                reappraisal and a new estimate but not a reduction. There was no

                            attempt to match the U.S. quantitatively. We cannot explain this policy
                            except that they hope for a breakthrough in strategic offensive
                            techniques which will offset U.S. quantitative advantage.</item>

                            defense with a strong possibility that they had or were approaching a
                            new technique. The status of construction in some of their facilities
                            did not permit an accurate analysis of Soviet state of the art or air

                            Early Warning, and therefore were quite possibly directed toward an
                            anti-satellite capability to “blind” us from photographic intelligence
                            gathering and we must be alert for this eventuality.</item>

                        <item>In summary, we were seeing a dynamic, progressive Soviet military
                            program that was not being cut back, that was sophisticated, that was
                            directed toward quality rather than quantity, and that there was a
                            possibility of a breakthrough of some sort which would redress the
                            present balance of power. This I said must not be overlooked and we must
                            continually be on the alert for such a development.</item>

                    <p>The Department of State has no objection to your raising with the President

                        Therefore, it is hoped that arrangements can be made to continue such
                        participation.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, although surveys such as the last <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss> study may not qualify as a basis for planning guidance,
                        the Department believes that a similar broad survey of a possible major
                        conflict between the United States and Communist China could serve a useful
                        purpose in clarifying issues and highlighting areas which could usefully be
                        the object of more detailed consideration.</p>
                    <p>If you agree, we suggest that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> meet soon with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> to discuss these matters.</p>

                        <item>With respect to the requirement for a Basic National Security Policy,
                            its compilation into a single document is desirable in principle, but,
                            at the present time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not lack policy
                            guidance for the preparation of military plans. Necessary guidance is
                            obtained through both face-to-face meetings and a continuing exchange of
                            written memoranda with the Secretary of Defense. Guidance also results
                            from meetings with the President, National Security Council meetings,
                            National Security Action Memoranda, National Country Policy papers, and
                            National Planning Task papers. Any effort to condense this guidance into
                            a single document could result in a paper so <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0233"/>broad that it would be difficult to keep it meaningful
                            and yet up-to-date. To the degree that such a document contained
                            specific guidance, it could place inflexible restrictions on military
                            planning and limit the scope of military advice on subsequent national
                            security problems.</item>

                        <item>Lack of a Basic National Security Policy has not handicapped the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff in developing basic short-range (<gloss target="#t_JSCP1">JSCP</gloss>), mid-range (<gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>), and long-range (<gloss target="#t_JLRSS1">JLRSS</gloss>) plans, as well as specific contingency plans.
                            Reliance on these documents has permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
                            provide suitable military advice for specific purposes. It seems evident
                            that questions such as “Are we prepared and preparing for the most
                            likely kind of war?” (Page 2, <gloss target="#t_NESC1">NESC</gloss>
                            Report) should never be foreclosed by a master planning document.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>With regard to the related problem of close coordination of military
                            and political planning, interagency discussion of national objectives
                            and national security policies would provide a useful exchange of ideas.
                            The substance of approved documents such as National Security Action
                            Memoranda, National Policy papers, and related military documents (e.g.,
                                <gloss target="#t_JSCP1">JSCP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_JLRSS1">JLRSS</gloss>) could
                            provide a basis for these discussions, although it should be understood
                            that the intent of the discussions is not to address these documents
                            themselves or to suggest changes in them. Rather, such a process would
                            give increased background knowledge and perception to the military and
                            political officers concerned and could well provide for better inputs to
                            future political and military plans. These discussions, conducted at the
                            division chief/action officer level, would be informational in nature
                            and supplemental to the liaison now carried out at higher levels.
                            Political-military problem areas that are identified can be added to the

                            crisis planning. This type of planning is being carried out along with
                            other forms of planning for particular countries, areas, and
                            circumstances. To segregate crisis planning from other planning would
                            tend to make it less effective and could result in a failure to consider
                            all appropriate factors. The principal need is to assure that timely and
                            adequate planning is accomplished, and the recent establishment of an
                            inter-agency group to facilitate the timely initiation and coordination
                            of political-military planning should be of value in this regard.<note n="4" xml:id="d75fn4">In a March 1 memorandum to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Deputy Assistant

                        <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are in broad general agreement with the
                            principles and concepts developed in the study (see Appendix A hereto)
                            and believe that the study provides an excellent basis for furthering
                            rapport and understanding among the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of
                            the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental agencies concerned with
                            planning for command and control at the national level. The first
                            assumption in the terms of reference states that it is extremely
                            unlikely that the President would leave the Washington area during a
                            crisis situation. It is noted that the study nevertheless advocates the
                            principle of multiplicity of centers for Presidential protection and
                            infers that the likelihood of Presidential relocation would
                            significantly increase as a crisis intensifies, even if the crisis is
                            short of general war. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider these points to
                            be valid both prior to and after construction of a Deep Underground
                            Command Center (<gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss>); however,
                            continued improvement of national command and control capabilities
                            depends on a better understanding between all principals of the
                            conditions under which the President might seek protection.</item>

                                    the crisis. In contrast, capabilities for information support

                            Military Command Center (<gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss>), the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirm their previous position that these
                            facilities are essential to our command and control capabilities in the
                            foreseeable future. They concur with much of the analysis relating to

                            capabilities. However, they are concerned that the study does not
                            support these facilities strongly enough. Specifically: <list>

                                    principles in the study. First, survivability is stressed and
                                    the <gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss> is significantly
                                    harder than [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                        not declassified</hi>]. More important, the study stresses
                                    collocation of the President and his principal advisors with
                                    their supporting military staff. Such collocation could be
                                    achieved much more effectively at the <gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss> than at [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                                    relocation are compared, the Joint Chiefs of Staff would rate

                                    with the analyses and conclusions in the body of the report. For

                    </p>
                    <p>With the passage of time since the acute bipolar confrontations in Berlin and
                        Cuba, in 1961–62, the shape of the world scene is altering. The environment
                        in which we must seek to protect and advance the nation’s abiding interests
                        is changing its shape.</p>
                    <p>Briefly stated, we are somewhere between a cold war between two great blocs
                        and a world of nation states; we are somewhere between a world organized
                        rationally, respectful of the inescapable interdependencies of modern life,
                        and the chaos of old-fashioned nationalism; we are somewhere between a world
                        split on lines of wealth and race and differing stages of modernization and
                        a community of partners in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.</p>
                    <p>If we are to use our limited but real margin of influence to produce from
                        this lively, dangerous but not unhopeful, situation a world of nation
                        states, organized in ways which respect their interdependencies, operating
                        as a global community under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter,
                        we need fresh bearings and, in some cases, new lines of action.</p>
                    <p>To set the stage for this exposition, it may be useful to present the problem
                        we confront in the form of a series of paradoxes which characterize the
                        essentially transitional passage of history through which we are passing and
                        which we must seek, within our capabilities, to shape.</p>

                        <item>—Although the danger of overt Communist aggression, nuclear or
                            conventional, has been evidently reduced, there is no indication that
                            policy in Moscow or Peiping is restrained from the overt use of force by
                            any factor other than credible opposing force—mainly U.S. military
                            force.</item>
                        <item>—Although there has been in Western Europe and Japan a remarkable
                            increase in economic power and political confidence and assertiveness,
                            this revival has not been accompanied by a proportionate rise in nuclear
                            or conventional military capacity; and, similarly, the rise of
                            nationalist impulses and fragmentation within the Communist world has
                            not been accompanied by an equivalent diffusion of nuclear or
                            conventional military capacity away from Moscow and Peiping.</item>
                        <item>—There are strong forces at work on the world scene tending towards
                            the diffusion of nuclear power, although the net security advantage of a
                            small nuclear capability is, in almost every case, negative on any
                            objective assessment.</item>
                        <item>—The most dangerous current military threat to the security of the

                            the developing nations, they lack a capacity to solve their security or
                            economic problems on a national basis; and even on a regional basis they
                            require intimate collaboration with the more advanced powers to solve
                            their major domestic and security problems.</item>

                    <p>This category of policy is evidently, critical in both the short run and the

                    <p>In the short run our world position depends on maintaining the essential

                        trade and agricultural policy; and in monetary affairs. Failure in any of
                        these areas of active negotiation could weaken the fabric of the

                    <p>In the long run, the acceptance of wider responsibilities on a world basis by

                        Japan, Australia, and New Zealand is essential to the execution of this

                    <p>24. The argument here is that, broadly speaking, we face in other regions of
                        the world, each in a context that is unique, the same kind of problem that
                        we have already confronted and in which we have done much pioneer work in
                        the past generation with respect to the Atlantic world and Latin America. It
                        is further assumed that there is no region in the world to whose evolution
                        we can be indifferent, given the character of our national interest,
                        although our regional interests vary and are of different weight.</p>
                    <p>25. Before concluding our observations on regionalism, it is worth posing a
                        prior question; namely, whether or not the United States is now, in some
                        meaningful sense, overextended on the world scene.</p>
                    <p>Do our military and economic commitments on the mainland or Eurasia, as well
                        as in Africa and Latin America, constitute an increasing or intolerable
                        strain on our resources?</p>
                    <p>Is the potential strength of our adversaries increasing relative to our own
                        at a rate which justifies considering a retraction of U.S. commitment?</p>
                    <p>Is there some other sense in which we are over-committed?</p>
                    <p>So far as U.S. resources are concerned, Appendix B<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">A table entitled “U.S. Defense Expenditure and Foreign Aid as Related
                            to the U.S. Gross National Product and National Income at Factor Cost,
                            1946–1966”; not printed.</note> makes clear that both over-all defense
                        expenditures and foreign aid expenditures are a declining proportion of our
                        annual output. Defense expenditures for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1965 are down to 7.5% of GNP, having fallen away from 9.5% a decade earlier;
                        economic and military aid expenditures (excluding PL 480 and Export-Import
                        Bank loans) are down to .48% of GNP from a figure of 1.1% in 1955. Economic
                        assistance, at about the same absolute level as 1955 ($2 billion) has fallen
                        from .51% of GNP to .32% of GNP. So long as the U.S. economy continues to
                        expand at a reasonable rate there can be no serious anxiety about our
                        capacity to sustain present military and foreign aid commitments or to
                        expand them substantially, if necessary, without endangering the progress of
                        our domestic life.</p>
                    <p>There is, of course, a continuing problem of assuring that outlays abroad in
                        support of our security commitments do not endanger our balance of payments
                        or the confidence felt in the dollar as a reserve currency. This real
                        problem lends itself to resolution by many devices other than a retraction
                        of defense outlays or foreign aid expenditures, notably because these
                        expenditures are already substantially cushioned in their impact on the
                        balance of payments and because national security should continue to enjoy a
                        priority higher than, for example, long-term <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0251"/>private investment in Western Europe or certain other
                        private outlays abroad.</p>
                    <p>We could also be judged to be overextended if our potential adversaries were
                        increasing their industrial capacity or military outlays at a rate which, if
                        matched by us, could impose intolerable strains on our domestic life. This
                        is, evidently, not the case. While there is no cause for complacency with
                        respect to the evolution of either Soviet or Chinese Communist military
                        capabilities, they do not appear to be evolving in ways or at a pace beyond
                        our capacity to deter within the range of recent or existing percentage
                        allocations of our over-all resources. We are most likely to be embarrassed
                        by qualitative, rather than quantitative, changes in the military
                        capabilities of our major adversaries.</p>
                    <p>What, then, accounts for recent discussions of “over-commitment”?</p>
                    <p>First, the rise of national assertiveness, in forms as various as Gaullism,
                        the burning of libraries, and Buddhist antics in Saigon, has converged with
                        the sense of release from Soviet nuclear blackmail after the Cuba missile
                        crisis, to make the world appear both less tractable and less dangerous than
                        it was in, say, the period 1961–62. There is a widespread, if ill-defined,
                        feeling that if foreigners don’t like us, let’s pull back, and that some
                        pull-back would be safe.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, our painful and frustrating experience in Laos and Viet Nam makes
                        men search for solutions and perspectives which would permit our withdrawal
                        while believing that no grave damage would be done to vital U.S. or Free
                        World interests.</p>
                    <p>What passes for “over-commitment” is, in this sense, simply frustration in
                        achieving our objectives by existing means in the turbulent and assertive
                        environment we confront, compounded by Communist methods for expanding
                        indirectly their power and influence in that environment, combined with a
                        correct perception that other nations are seeking ways to solve their
                        problems which involves less brute depend-ence on the United States than in
                        the past.</p>
                    <p>There is a second sense in which we are very heavily committed, if not
                        over-committed, as compared to earlier times. Every region on the planet is
                        now part of a sensitively interacting world community. In the immediate
                        postwar years, major decisions could focus on the Atlantic world, Japan, and
                        relations with Moscow. Now not only have the countries of Latin America,
                        Africa, the Middle East and Asia entered the game but Communist China and
                        the individual countries of Eastern Europe appear on the stage with
                        independent or quasi-independent personalities. This proliferation of states
                        and emerging centers of power and influence diminish our capacity to
                        influence or control given situations by means we have used in the past; and
                        requires new methods and involvement of new kinds if we are to bring our
                        residual margin of <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0252"/>influence to
                        bear on issues of vital interest. The number of U.S. relationships and
                        problems capable of forcing a decision at the highest levels of the
                        government has thus vastly multiplied. The working levels of government can
                        be—and have been—expanded to deal with this phenomenon at home and in the
                        field. But we can have only one President and one Secretary of State. And
                        here the real burden of commitment and active engagement has been
                        enlarged.</p>
                    <p>The burden of this paper is, then, that what we confront is not a question of
                        continuing existing policies and commitments or pulling back. What we face
                        is the task of transforming our relations with the nations of the Free
                        World, region by region, in such a way as to permit them an enlarged role in
                        their own destiny while permitting us to perform the minimum security,
                        economic, and political functions required in their interests and in ours.
                        This concept does involve a kind of selective relaxation of presence and
                        pressure, as we encourage the nations themselves increasingly to take
                        responsibility for assessing their interests and formulating responsible
                        proposals for collective action. It does not, however, permit a significant
                        withdrawal of U.S. security commitment and presence. And, as our experience
                        with the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> as opposed to the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> suggests, as well as our experience with
                        CIAP, partnership in regional organizations (as opposed to dependence) tends
                        to increase rather than to diminish the range and intimacy of contacts and
                        common enterprise.</p>
                    <p>If all goes well, then, the present phase of rather anarchic nationalism
                        abroad, with its counterpart in neo-isolationist impulses at home, should
                        give way to relations of enlarging partnership in one region after the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>That, in any case, is what the state of our environment and the character of
                        our abiding interests appear to require. But it will not happen without a
                        clear U.S. sense of direction, quiet leadership, and persistence.</p>

                        of nuclear air defense weapons to National Guard units.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">

                        National Guard air defense units would be slow to act in an emergency due to
                        administrative requirements for federalization. The requested authority
                        would permit release of weapons and operational employment in accordance
                        with emergency action procedures approved for regular forces.</p>
                    <p>I held up this action last year because of the risk of misunderstanding, in
                        the light of the controversy over control of nuclear weapons. This is in
                        fact a quite routine adjustment of emergency procedures, but it might not
                        have seemed so in 1964. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the Joint Chiefs of Staff now feel that it

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to enclose for your use revised “Guidance for Non-Military
                            Planning”<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">The subtitle of the publication is
                            “1965 Issue”; not printed.</note> which I reported on at Cabinet meeting
                        March 25.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">No record of this meeting has been
                            found.</note> This provides new assumptions for use by Federal
                        departments and agencies in the further development of their civil emergency
                        preparedness. It supersedes the document of the same title issued October
                        31, 1963, by the Office of Emergency Planning.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The new guidance has been brought up to date by the Committee on Assumptions
                        for Non-Military Planning, established by the President. The Committee, as
                        you know, consists of representatives from the Department of State, the
                        Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency, with the
                        Director of the Office of Emergency Planning serving as chairman. I am glad
                        to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the participation of
                        your representative, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Weapons
                        Acquisition and Industrial Readiness, Mr. <persName>James Davis</persName>,
                        and the members of the working group, Mr. <persName>Eckhard
                            Bennewitz</persName> and Mr. <persName>Henry A. Damminger</persName>.
                        The final document owes a great deal indeed to their substantive
                        contributions and constructive comments.</p>
                    <p>The new guidance differs in several respects from the document it supersedes.
                        It is more specific where lack of specificity was found to be a handicap to
                        use. It also reflects a much greater emphasis on the necessity to prepare
                        for less-than-nuclear situations up to and including large-scale
                        conventional wars. There is corresponding reduction in the likelihood (but
                        not the importance) of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>It is important that civil emergency preparedness—both current arrangements
                        and future plans—reflect this change of emphasis and other more specific
                        planning factors covered in the guidance. I therefore suggest that you
                        review your emergency plans and programs to assure their responsiveness to
                        these contingency assumptions. If in the course <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0256"/>of your review you discover the need for special situation
                        assumptions, I will undertake to see that they are provided, working with
                        the members of the Committee on Assumptions as appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <item>Soviet decisions since Khrushchev’s fall do not indicate any general
                            alteration in his military policies. During the next six years, we
                            believe that the main aim of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s
                            military policy and programs will remain that of strengthening the
                            Soviet deterrent.<note n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">The Director of the
                                National Security Agency and the Assistant Chief of Staff,
                                Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> consider that
                                the intensity with which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                is pursuing a massive military research and development program—the
                                specific content and progress of which are not clearly known to the
                                US—portends far more than an intent merely to strengthen Soviet
                                deterrent posture. They believe that attainment of strategic
                                superiority continues to be the goal of Soviet political and
                                military leadership and that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is actively searching for ways and means of
                                building toward parity and ultimate superiority. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> In the strategic field, we expect the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to increase the numbers and
                            effectiveness of a variety of weapon systems and, in particular, greatly
                            to improve retaliatory capabilities. These programs may include the
                            deployment of anti-missile defenses. But we think it highly unlikely
                            that the Soviets could achieve a combination of offensive and defensive
                            forces so strong as to persuade the leadership that it could launch a
                            strategic attack upon the West and limit to acceptable proportions the
                            subsequent damage to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (Paras.

                        <item>The Soviets will continue to press their dynamic military and space
                                <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> programs. Soviet security
                            considerations demand vigorous efforts to prevent a Western military
                            technological advantage which might threaten the credibility of their
                            deterrent. Beyond this, we believe that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort represents an attempt to
                            achieve major technological advances in the hope of offsetting present
                            Western strategic advantages. Should the Soviets achieve a technological
                            advance which offered the prospect of significant improvement in
                            military capabilities, they would seek to exploit it for political and
                            military advantage, but their decisions as to deployment would involve a
                            weighing of such advantage against economic considerations and US
                            capabilities to counter. (Paras. 29–32)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>With respect to theater forces, capabilities for nuclear combat will
                            remain a prime Soviet concern. Certain recent trends, however, point to
                            a growing concern with non-nuclear war, and we expect Soviet <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0258"/>military policy to devote increasing
                            attention to this contingency. Further, there is some evidence that the
                            Soviets intend to develop greater capabilities for distant, limited
                            military action, an area in which they are presently at a great
                            disadvantage. (Paras. 40–43, 56–57)</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>The new Soviet leaders will continue to apply economic restraints to
                            the expansion of military programs. The Soviet economy could support a
                            substantially increased military effort. Nevertheless, the demands of
                            costly military and space programs conflict directly with the
                            requirements of the civil economy, and the newly announced agricultural
                            program does not portend any early easing of economic constraints.
                            Barring important changes in the international situation, we consider
                            major shifts in the level of Soviet defense spending to be unlikely.
                            (Paras. 20, 25–27)</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>Soviet military policy will also be heavily influenced by external
                            developments. In Eastern Europe, if present trends toward autonomy
                            continue, the Warsaw Pact will evolve toward a conventional military
                            alliance, and the range of contingencies in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> can rely on effective support from
                            its Warsaw Pact allies will narrow. In Asia, the hardening of the
                            Sino-Soviet dispute will probably force the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to recognize the military implications of China’s
                            hostility and ambitions, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will probably strengthen conventional forces in Soviet Asia. In Western
                            Europe, the Soviets would consider their military problem to be sharply
                            altered by any important changes in the political cohesion or military
                            effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But the Soviets
                            will continue to weigh the adequacy of military programs primarily
                            against US capabilities, and to judge the desirability of proposed
                            programs against probable US reaction. (Paras. 33–36)</item>
                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>Beyond the general mission of deterrence, we doubt that any single
                            doctrinal design, meeting the tests of comprehensiveness and
                            feasibility, will govern the development of Soviet military forces over
                            the next six years. Old debates which seem certain to outlive
                            Khrushchev’s departure, the momentum of deployment programs, the clash
                            of vested interests, attempts to capitalize on some technological
                            advance, an urge to match or counter various enemy capabilities—these
                            are some of the factors which are likely to inhibit any far-reaching
                            rationalization of military policy around a single doctrine. (Para.

                    <p rend="center">Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
                    <p>The President increasingly becomes the focal point of crisis management as a
                        crisis intensifies. He devotes more time to the crisis and considers
                        selected operations in greater detail. The President needs and operates with
                        extreme flexibility—flexibility in constituting his immediate decision
                        group; in defining alternate courses of action that must be considered; in
                        determining, to the extent feasible, the timing of the U.S. responses and
                        therefore the time allowable for staff inputs; flexibility in seeking
                        detailed information on selected military operations; in establishing and
                        employing the organization and operational command chain including reducing
                        the number of echelons of command; flexibility in determining the
                        sensitivity of selected information relating to the crisis; in communicating
                        with allied, neutral and enemy heads of state; and in establishing
                        constraints or accepting risks in conducting the crisis.</p>
                    <p>The President will select the <hi rend="italic">Presidential Group</hi> that
                        will assist him in directing a given crisis. This has invariably been true
                        in the past and it is reasonable to assume that it will continue to be so in
                        the future. Since the Presidential Group will include personal advisors, and
                        statutory advisors and their subordinates, it will reflect military,
                        political, diplomatic, intelligence and other such interests that might be
                        relevant to the crisis. As a crisis develops, the composition of the
                        Presidential Group will normally grow and alter.</p>
                    <p>So far the U.S. has experienced only a very few of the infinite number of
                        crisis situations with which command and control support arrangements must
                        be prepared to cope. Crisis situations, far more intense than any yet
                        experienced, but nevertheless short of a large scale intercontinental
                        nuclear exchange, are possible. These should be given more consideration in
                        the development of U.S. command and control arrangements. For example, as
                        indicated below, consideration of <hi rend="italic">intense crises</hi> can
                        have a significant impact on plans for presidential protection.</p>
                    <p>During a crisis the President and the Presidential Group will probably use
                        mission-oriented interagency groups to assist them in estimating the present
                        situation, and in developing and evaluating alternate courses of action.
                        These groups may be asked to consider broad or narrow aspects of the crisis.
                        The President and the Presidential Group expect that such support has melded
                        military, political, domestic and diplomatic factors. Accordingly, the
                        constitution of the Presidential Group and their need for staff support
                        implies the need for interagency staffing before estimates and advice are
                        advanced to the Presidential Group.</p>
                    <p>For severe crises, the composition and extent of the advisory staff support
                        to the President will be uniquely determined at the time of the crisis by
                        the nature of the crisis including such factors as timing, areas <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0261"/>and participants, scope of conflict, the
                        opportunity and the need for secrecy, escalatory potential, and diplomatic
                        constraints. On the other hand, the routine information support capabilities
                        needed to support these individuals are much more predictable. These
                        capabilities include communications and message distribution, provision of
                        factual data on force status and plans, routine staff support in
                        implementing and promulgating decisions, conferencing and display
                        facilities, and the staff which operates and provides these capabilities.
                        Accordingly, it is desirable and feasible to separate conceptually and
                        organizationally the problem of providing the advisory staff support from
                        that of providing the routine information support. It is difficult to
                        improvise information support during a crisis and it is possible to
                        anticipate the requirements for this support before the crisis. The reverse
                        is true for staff advisory support.</p>
                    <p>Presidential councils are informal and consultative in nature. The President
                        receives his information support through his advisors and, accordingly,
                        crisis management would not be enhanced by establishment at the national
                        level of an elaborate “National Command Center” manned by a large, permanent
                        interagency staff.</p>
                    <p>Many avenues are available that would improve interagency effectiveness in
                        crisis anticipation and management. The following are recommended: increased
                        attention at all levels of the Joint Staff with crisis management, freer
                        interaction at all levels between members of the Joint Staff and their
                        counterparts in other agencies, greater interagency review of military and
                        political contingency plans, increased inter-agency participation in war
                        gaming and exercising, and increased attention within the Joint Staff on
                        nonmilitary factors affecting crisis anticipation and management.</p>
                    <p>Within the military establishment the concept of handling crises within
                        command posts or operations centers is well established. The <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> is similar to, but both narrower and
                        broader in its scope than the conventional operations center. It is narrower
                        in that its support to decision makers is rendered through the medium of
                        their staff advisors, and ordinarily it does not itself provide advisory
                        staff support except when an emergency does not permit referral to such
                        advisors. It is broader in that the principal users of <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> information support are not only the
                        Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, but also various elements of
                            <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and authorized persons in the White
                        House, State Department and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> performs the functions of (1)
                        warning and alert, (2) information support, and (3) implementation. Its
                        principal suppliers of information to the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> are the operating forces, the service operations centers,
                        and the <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> through the Intelligence Support
                        and Indications Center.</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0262"/>
                    <p>The fundamental character of the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> is
                        that of a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> information support facility
                        operated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> as a whole. In the performance of its functions the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> should exchange information freely with
                        analogous information centers elsewhere within the Government.</p>
                    <p>The management arrangements under which the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> operates should preserve its close working relationship
                        with the Directorate for Operations in the Joint Staff and also should
                        reflect its essentially informational character and DoD-wide scope.</p>
                    <p>Future development of the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> should
                        emphasize evolutionary improvement as opposed to sweeping change. Such
                        evolution will be helped by increased efforts to evaluate <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> performances both in actual crises and in
                        exercises. The establishment of suitable performance standards for the
                            <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> will also be helpful in its
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Exercises of a variety of types and scope are necessary not only for the
                        improvement of the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss> but also to
                        familiarize participating decision makers with its facilities and with
                        command problems. For some of these exercises, senior members from all
                        affected agencies and their staffs should participate.</p>
                    <p>At any stage of crisis or general nuclear war, enemy options range from a
                        deliberate heavy attack against national command centers to strenuously
                        avoiding these targets. In addition, there are a host of foreseeable and
                        unforeseeable events that could lead to nuclear strikes on Washington or to
                        Washington remaining completely undamaged. In providing for command and
                        control support to the President, all of these contingencies must be
                        considered. In providing survivability for the President, the worst cases
                        must be planned for.</p>
                    <p>There are many factors militating against presidential relocation during
                        crises short of general war. However, if the enemy decides to escalate a
                        crisis to general war, he can easily destroy unprotected national centers
                        without the President’s receiving tactical warning. If tactical warning of
                        an attack is received, it is not clear that the President’s wisest course
                        would be to seek immediate protection. Accordingly, capabilities should be
                        provided for presidential protection in a highly survivable command center
                            <hi rend="italic">during any phase of crisis</hi>. This center must
                        allow the President and the Presidential Group to manage intense crises
                        short of general nuclear war as well as these can be managed from the White
                        House.</p>
                    <p>The unique value of the President required that all possible measures be
                        taken to insure his personal survival of an attack on the U.S. However,
                        provision for a successor is also necessary. Accordingly, capabilities
                        should allow relocation to a highly survivable center of an alternate
                        Presidential Group headed by a presidentially designated alternate <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0263"/>Commander-in-Chief. The command and
                        control support for this alternate group could be much more austere than
                        those for a relocated President.</p>
                    <p>It is important to recognize the national-level character of those alternates
                        that might be used by the President or an Alternate Decision Group as
                        contrasted with the DoD-level role of the <gloss target="#t_NMCC1">NMCC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> in Washington would be the only
                        facility that could adequately satisfy the presidential needs for
                        accessibility combined with survivability and adequate staff support.
                        However, since a <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> cannot be operational
                        for at least five years, in the interim only the <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss> ship and a National Mobile Land Command Post (<gloss target="#t_NMLCP1">NMLCP</gloss>) come close to approximating the
                        requirements of: adequate staff support; high volume (not necessarily
                        survivable) communications between the alternate and soft Washington
                        centers; continuous operation for a period of days or weeks; and high
                        survivability of the alternate itself. The <gloss target="#t_NEACP1">NEACP</gloss> falls short of meeting the first three criteria: the
                            <gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss> fails on the last.</p>
                    <p>For the time period before a <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> could be
                        operational, the study developed the following three different
                        configurations of alternates ranging from most austere to the most adequate: <list>
                            <label>a.</label>
                            <item>Two functionally similar <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss>
                                ships</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>Three <gloss target="#t_NEACP1">NEACP</gloss> aircraft, plus (a)
                                above</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>An <gloss target="#t_NMLCP1">NMLCP</gloss> with a staff capacity
                                somewhat less than an <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss>, plus
                                (b) above.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Study recommends alternative (b) above. An <gloss target="#t_NMLCP1">NMLCP</gloss> is not recommended unless greater emphasis is placed on
                        providing flexible capabilities for presidential relocation during intense
                        crises short of general war.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> assisted by DCA and the Navy should
                        conduct a study that develops plans for remedying the operational defects of
                        the current two-ship <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss> element. This
                        study should: i) detail the functional needs and criteria for support of the
                        Presidential Group during intense crises and during the strategic exchange
                        phase; ii) compare the costs and schedules of significantly improving the
                            <hi rend="italic">Northampton</hi> or obtaining a replacement hull; and,
                        iii) consider operating concepts with the current or new ships.</p>
                    <p>The operational concept and support plans of the <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_NEACP1">NEACP</gloss> should be
                        revised to provide for greater endurance, survivability and accessibility.
                        For the <gloss target="#t_NECPA1">NECPA</gloss>, this planning should
                        include increased protection from various forms of attack, larger and faster
                        transportation capability between Washington and the ships, and operations
                        closer to the Washington area during crises. For the <gloss target="#t_NEACP1">NEACP</gloss>, the planning should include use of
                        aerial refueling, permanent dispersal of the aircraft, capability for
                        post-strike use of several <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0264"/>bases
                        that have prelocated logistics and communications support, and plans for
                        locating the aircraft closer to Washington during severe crises.</p>
                    <p>Because of its relatively low survivability, the <gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss> is not suited to use by the President or an Alternate
                        Decision Group during an intense crisis or the initial stages of a general
                        war. The <gloss target="#t_AJCC1">AJCC</gloss> should be continued with
                        primarily the following functions: act as a potential reconstitution site in
                        the follow-on phases of a general war; provide a dispersed back-up to
                        Washington communications; and support other <gloss target="#t_NMCS1">NMCS</gloss> centers for day-to-day operations and crises. A detailed
                        functional and technical analysis of the current and planned <gloss target="#t_AJCC1">AJCC</gloss> should be conducted in order to develop a
                        better understanding of how particular capabilities and costs contribute to
                        each of these functions. The study should indicate potential savings.</p>

                                proper Presidential support to go with the emergency plans, which
                                are charged to the Office of the Military Aide at present. We have
                                gone about as far as we can go with the present guidance.
                                Fundamentally the President should have recommendations made to him
                                as to the specific locations of his possible successors, including
                                the Vice President, and see that appropriate staff assignments are
                                made so that if a nuclear attack occurred, and the President were
                                lost, the command function could be carried on by one or more
                                successors.</p>

                                to go to the location of the Vice President, and that the Vice
                                President and the agencies be so directed; and that the proper
                                communications be established at these points when the Vice
                                President goes.</p>

                        <item>Most important, it behooves us to improve our own decision support to
                            the President. As you can see from this study, decision support falls in
                            several categories, including information, staff, etc. It is quite
                            obvious from even the recent experience in the Dominican Republic
                            situation that it takes from three to four days to extemporize a
                            situation room and staff to meet a Presidential requirement even in a
                            minor crisis in which our own security is not threatened. This could be
                            improved with a little thought and some preparation on a more permanent
                            basis. The staff and decision support of the President of the United
                            States can be put on a better established basis now that we are so well
                            acquainted with the working habits of the President, as well as his
                            decision-making procedures.</item>

                        <item>In <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–64, we estimated that
                            deployment of second-generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                            in soft sites and three-silo hard sites had come to an end, and that the

                            dispersed single silos. Subsequent evidence has confirmed these trends,
                            but single silos apparently have been started at a faster pace than
                            previously estimated.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We have now identified about 125 single silos, all begun since about
                            January 1964. The actual number under construction is probably larger.
                            When compared to past rates of starting <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, the present level of activity is high; the
                            largest number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers
                            previously started in a single year was about 90. The building rate,
                            however, is not without precedent nor does it represent what could be
                            termed a maximum effort; at one point in 1963 about 140 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers were under construction in
                            a variety of site configurations, and MR/IRBM launcher construction was

                        <item>We believe that the most advanced of these launchers will not reach
                            operational status until late 1965. This means that the mid-1965
                            operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strength will be about
                                225,<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">These totals do not include <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> launchers at Tyuratam. There are

                                launchers and we believe this number will increase to approximately
                                45 by mid-1966. We judge these launchers are not normally available
                                for operational use, but varying numbers of them could be prepared

                                11–8–64, but considers the mid-1965 figure will be at the low side

                                launchers). The mid-1966 figure will somewhat exceed the high side
                                of his forecast spread of 325–425 operational launchers in the field
                                and at Tyuratam. [Footnote in the source text. Regarding this

                        <item>We cannot yet determine what missiles are intended for the new silos.
                            The Soviets have tested two third generation <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems, the SS–9 and the SS–10. We believe that the
                            SS–9 which has followed a normal test program will be deployed in at
                            least some of the silos. The SS–10 was test fired eight times between
                            April and October 1964 but, for reasons we cannot explain, there have
                            been no test firings since. It too may be deployed in some of the
                            silos.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Finally, there is evidence pointing to the development of other
                            missiles, including one which is probably small, at the test range.
                            Thus, it is possible that some of the silos are intended for a new
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, which has not been identified
                            in test firings.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">We are unable to determine
                                whether this missile would employ solid or liquid propellants; we
                                believe that storable liquids are likely. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> If so, the deployment of the launchers so far in
                            advance of the flight tests of the missile would represent a departure
                            from previous Soviet practice. Such an innovation would imply confidence
                            that no major changes in the weapon system will be required; it could
                            stem from a desire to reach a planned <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force level more quickly than would otherwise be
                            possible. An intensive and successful test program would be necessary
                            for this missile to become available for extensive deployment as early
                            as mid-1966. Thus it is possible that many of the new silos listed as
                            operational in mid-1966 will at that time lack missiles.</item>

                        <item>It is not now clear how far the Soviets will push the current
                            deployment program or whether it will be succeeded by follow-on
                            programs. Though by mid-1967 the Soviets almost certainly will have more
                            than the 330–395 operational launchers estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–64, it is yet too early to revise
                            our estimate that the Soviets will achieve a force of 400–700 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers over the next five years.
                            We expect, however, that evidence collected before the publication of
                                <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–65 this far will help to

                                and direct controls. Indirect include: taxes, credit controls, and

                                Department and the Federal Reserve Board. Some of these measures are
                                part of our day-to-day economic system.</p>
                            <p>Direct controls include those for prices, wages and salaries, and
                                rents as well as rationing. Authority for such controls does not
                                exist today. Legislative proposals are kept ready, but capability to
                                administer these controls does not exist since substantial national
                                organizations would be required. Preliminary plans and arrangements
                                have been developed as a part of our regular preparedness. A
                                national organization could be established and in operation in a
                                period of 60–90 days.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>—No major national manpower problem is foreseen. Manpower shortages,
                            to the extent they would exist, would be in critical skills and
                            localized. These shortages could generally be met through existing
                            voluntary manpower measures already established by the Department of
                            Labor and endorsed by the National Labor-Management Manpower Policy
                            Committee. Care will have to be exercised in meeting military
                            requirements for medical personnel to minimize the effect on civilian
                            communities. Selective Service is ready to meet increased calls for
                            military personnel.</item>
                        <item>—In the transportation field there are three areas of possible
                            shortages: ocean shipping (where the Maritime Administration has already
                            pulled 14 ships from the National Defense Reserve Fleet), air cargo, and
                            rail freight. Shortages occur in rail freight today. Necessary action to
                            meet national defense requirements can be taken by the President under
                            existing law.</item>
                        <item>—To evaluate the potential economic and industrial impact of increased
                            defense spending, and to plan effectively the mobilization effort, we
                            must have a clear and detailed statement from the Department of Defense
                            on the size, composition, and phasing of defense requirements. I will
                            review this matter with the Secretary of Defense so that we can provide
                            coordinated civilian support.</item>

                        nuclear attack is inadequate and dated and fails to grapple realistically
                        with the formidable obstacles which would confront officials surviving such
                        an encounter. Of necessity, this basic reservation colors and qualifies some
                        of the comments which follow.</p>

                        the validity of present State/Defense understandings and arrangements which
                        have enhanced the President’s ability to give direction to politico-military
                        operations. I have in mind particularly the exchange of personnel between
                        our Operations Center and the National Military Command Center, the
                        monitoring by one department of the other’s significant message traffic, and
                        other machinery for managing crisis situations at the Presidential level.
                        Moreover, the study emphasizes the value of such activities as the recently
                        inaugurated State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> cooperation in
                        politico-military contingency planning and in the development and conduct of
                        major <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> exercises.</p>
                    <p>We also note that the current study reinforces the previously advanced
                        justification for the construction of a Deep Underground Command Center
                            (<gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss>). The National Military Command
                        System’s <hi rend="italic">Master Plan</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">

                        State Department representation in both the sea and airborne alternates, as
                        well as the <gloss target="#t_ANMCC1">ANMCC</gloss>. We will give further
                        study to operational concepts <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>and
                        physical arrangements applicable to State Department functions both at and
                        in support of such command posts.</p>
                    <p>Under its terms of reference, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> study
                        group was instructed to state projections of Presidential support obtainable
                        from non-<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> sources in “general terms”
                        only. We concur in the view that a Presidentially directed response to
                        varying crisis levels, up to and including general war, requires the
                        marshalling of a wider range of governmental resources than those of the
                        Department of Defense. Hence we believe that there is a need to explore more
                        specifically the conceptual requirements for non-<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> command and control support to the President which will
                        supplement the analysis of Department of Defense support developed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> study group. Initially, such an
                        undertaking would appear to call for a careful stock-taking by other key
                        agencies of their own responsibilities and capabilities in this field. The
                        Department of State, accordingly, will initiate a study along these lines at
                        an early date. We hope such a study will contribute to government-wide
                        understanding of the components of a total “national command” concept.</p>
                    <p>We shall be giving study to improving our own Command and Control System in
                        the days ahead. Undoubtedly this work will include consultations between our
                        respective Departments and joint consideration of pertinent materials,
                        including the present study. If this exercise results in additional
                        suggestions or proposals which might be worth your consideration in
                        connection with review of command and control procedures, we will be in
                        communication with you.</p>

                    <p>To estimate Soviet capabilities for secretly developing and deploying
                        strategic weapon systems and to examine factors bearing on Soviet intentions
                        in this regard, over the next few years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Scope Note</p>
                    <p>In this estimate, we assume that Western collection efforts will continue at
                        approximately their present levels. Soviet capabilities for concealing
                        strength under terms of an inspection agreement have not been considered,
                        since these capabilities would have to be assessed in detail in relation to
                        each of the many possible forms which such an inspection agreement might
                        take. We have, however, considered in general the effect which arms control
                        might have upon Soviet concealment.</p>
                    <p>In this estimate “concealment” is defined as an effort designed to limit
                        Western knowledge of Soviet military programs. Its usual aim is to induce an
                        underestimate of Soviet capabilities. It would also hamper targeting and
                        reduce Western ability to develop countermeasures to Soviet weapons
                        systems.</p>

                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>By definition, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                            achieve complete and successful concealment of weapons systems, the fact
                            would be unknown to US intelligence unless and until the Soviets chose
                            to reveal it. It cannot, of course, be conclusively proven that
                            successful concealment of this sort has not happened. It must be
                            acknowledged at the outset that successful concealment is and will
                            remain a possibility.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets have instituted concealment measures in all phases of
                            their strategic weapons programs. The extent of these efforts and <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0277"/>their success have varied from
                            program to program and even within programs. In general, however, the
                            Soviets have been most successful in denying information on strategic
                            weapons programs in the research and development phase. They have been
                            less successful as a program progresses to systems testing, and have
                            not, we believe, been able to conceal any large-scale deployment
                            programs.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>To some extent, these concealment efforts of the Soviets represent an
                            extension of the devotion to secrecy that permeates their society. This
                            factor alone would account for the rigorous physical security measures
                            protecting strategic weapons facilities from observation by nearby
                            inhabitants, as well as by clandestine agents or attaches.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Such concealment efforts as the Soviets have undertaken appear to have
                            been directed toward hiding precise locations in operational deployment
                            of a system and denying information on its characteristics. They clearly
                            know of some of the various advanced intelligence collection methods
                            employed by the US and almost certainly suspect the existence of others.
                            But complicating Soviet concealment efforts is the variety of collection
                            programs employed by the West which, in the process of all source
                            analysis, results in a total body of intelligence greater than the sum
                            of its parts. Thus, to be effective, a Soviet effort completely to
                            conceal a strategic weapon program would require a complex and generally
                            costly variety of safeguards. We believe that they now have insufficient
                            incentive to undertake such an effort.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>On the other hand, it is unlikely that Soviet efforts to conceal
                            certain aspects of their strategic weapons programs will diminish, and
                            they may increase. We cannot predict the extent to which contemplated
                            improvements in US collection capabilities may be offset by an
                            intensification of Soviet concealment efforts. But even if the Soviets
                            undertake no additional measures, we consider it unlikely that our
                            ability to detect, identify, and assess a new weapon system in the
                            pretesting stage of development will improve. For the foreseeable
                            future, new Soviet weapon systems are likely to have been under
                            development for several years before they are detected in testing or in
                            deployment, and the increasingly complex technology of modern weapons
                            will probably lengthen further the time between initial research and
                            deployment.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>We believe that the Soviets have, or could develop, greater
                            capabilities for concealment than they have practiced, and it is
                            possible that their policy will change. If they should come to believe
                            that the credibility of their deterrent is well-established, they may
                            increase concealment activity in order to improve their retaliatory
                            capabilities. While it is difficult to foresee technological
                            breakthroughs, we consider it improbable that they could successfully
                            conceal the deployment of strategic weapons in such numbers as to alter
                            significantly the present strategic relationship.</item>
                        <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0278"/>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The preceding paragraphs have discussed Soviet concealment primarily
                            in the context of past and present conditions, that is, without an arms
                            control agreement. In general, we do not foresee that an arms control
                            agreement would significantly affect either US intelligence capabilities
                            or Soviet concealment capabilities except as specific provisions might
                            facilitate or discourage particular modes of intelligence collection or
                            inspection. The effectiveness of any specific provisions of the
                            agreement would depend on their content and the machinery for enforcing
                            them, and cannot be estimated in the abstract. Certain general
                            considerations can, however, be set forth.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>The conclusion of an arms control agreement would probably signify
                            that the Soviets had decided to accept, at least for a time, the
                            strategic balance envisaged in the agreement. However, the Soviets might
                            conclude such an agreement in hopes of freezing US strategic forces
                            while secretly trying to build up their own. In the first case, they
                            might subsequently decide that, because of international developments or
                            for other reasons, they required substantially larger forces. In such
                            circumstances they might choose to abrogate an agreement openly rather
                            than to attempt to evade its provisions; they took a similar action
                            during the Berlin crisis of 1961 when they ended the moratorium on
                            nuclear testing. If they decided to abrogate, they would almost
                            certainly make secret preparations for a resumption of the arms
                            competition in advance of the announcement.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>Nevertheless, under certain arms control agreements, the Soviets might
                            see concealment as offering a strategic advantage which was worth the
                            risk. If, for example, the US and the Soviet Union should be limited by
                            an agreement to small numbers of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles,
                            possession of even a few additional vehicles could significantly change
                            the strategic equation. Depending on the provisions of the agreement,
                            and the rules for policing it, they might assess the risk of detection
                            as small, but they could hardly dismiss it as non-existent. And they
                            would have to consider that if the concealed forces were detected, the
                            arms control agreements would be abrogated in circumstances politically
                            disadvantageous to them, and the West would make strenuous efforts to
                            redress any real or presumed disparity.</item>
                        <label>10.</label>
                        <item>If the Soviets should employ concealment to violate the arms control
                            treaty, we believe that their aim would be to change the strategic
                            balance. Any smaller stakes would hardly justify the risks. Such an
                            effort would imply a Soviet decision to accept the complexity and cost
                            of an all out concealment effort, thus degrading the reliance we could
                            have in our detection capabilities. Even in the face of determined
                            Soviet concealment efforts, there is a good chance that violations
                            involving large scale testing or deployment would be detected, but this
                            cannot be guaranteed. In view of our limited capabilities to detect the
                            early phases <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0279"/>of weapons
                            programs, we cannot assure detection sufficiently timely to preclude

                    <p>1. Most countries would make no distinction between the two assumed programs.
                        They would not believe a US claim that it was deploying such costly
                        ballistic missile defenses simply to guard against a minor threat; they
                        would look on the smaller program as merely the first stage of a larger one.
                        Accordingly, immediate reactions would be influenced more by the decision to
                        deploy than by the size of the program.</p>
                    <p>2. In the non-Communist world, initial reactions to the US decision would
                        depend to some extent on how the program was publicly presented. If it were
                        announced as a logical development in the US military effort and as a
                        response to Soviet progress in the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        field, and especially if there were prior consultations with friendly
                        governments, reactions in general probably would be mild and not
                        unfavorable. There would be, nevertheless, some unfavorable reactions, but
                        we believe that these too would be generally mild, of short duration, and
                        unlikely to have a significant effect on the relations of these countries
                        with the US.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">See footnotes to paragraphs 12 and

                        particularly the military-industrial trade journals. In addition, the
                        purpose and nature of the program would be described in public announcements
                        and in news reports attributed to official sources. Thus, the Soviets
                        probably would correctly estimate the general capabilities of either of the
                        assumed programs, but they would be unlikely to accept official US
                        explanations that the smaller program was intended primarily to counter the
                        type of threat which may eventually be posed by Communist China. The Soviets
                        almost certainly would see any US program for ballistic missile defenses as
                        a move to reduce the effectiveness of their strategic attack forces and
                        would take into account its effect upon their strategic position.</p>
                    <p>4. In assessing the significance of the US decision, the Soviets would be
                        influenced by the value which they attach to ballistic missile defenses and,
                        to a degree, by the status of their own program. The magnitude of the Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> effort points to a strong desire to
                        obtain missile defenses rapidly. We believe that the Soviets have no <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0281"/>such defenses operational at
                        present, but we know that they are pushing ahead with their R and D effort.
                        They have made, moreover, a stronger attempt in the last year or so to
                        convey the impression that they have succeeded in developing effective
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems. If the Soviet program were
                        progressing well at the time the US decision is announced, they probably
                        would take a calmer view of the US move than if their program were lagging.
                        It is possible that they would see the US announcement as having been
                        precipitated by recent Soviet claims in the area of missile defense.</p>
                    <p>5. The Soviet assessment would go beyond the military significance of the US
                        decision and consider as well political motivations. The Soviets would first
                        of all view the decision as evidence that the US was intent upon maintaining
                        its strategic position vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                        While they would recognize that their own <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program had contributed to the US decision, they would
                        judge that the US in this instance was willing to see, or at least saw no
                        way to avert, a continuation of the arms race. Further, it is conceivable
                        that they would view the decision as a move to force them to make military
                        expenditures which would keep their economy under strain. They might even
                        interpret it as a sign that the US considered nuclear war somewhat more
                        likely in the longer term, particularly if the announcement came at a time
                        of crisis in, for example, Vietnam. Associated expenditures for a shelter
                        program would probably strengthen the voice of those advocating this
                        interpretation. The Soviets would be likely to interpret the coupling of the
                        US announcement with a disarmament proposal for, say, reducing strategic
                        delivery vehicles as part and parcel of a scheme designed to restrict their
                        strategic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>6. In the propaganda field, the Soviets almost certainly would charge the US
                        with reducing the prospects for disarmament, and probably would accuse the
                        US of seeking to increase its capabilities for nuclear war. Over the longer
                        term, however, the Soviets probably would stress two propaganda lines: one,
                        that the concept of “Fortress America” was again gaining ascendancy in the
                        US; the other, that Soviet missile defenses were superior to those of the
                        US, and that the latter could not cope with a Soviet strategic missile
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>7. In their military planning, the Soviets probably have already taken into
                        account the likelihood that the US would develop an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability. Nevertheless, they would feel compelled to
                        respond to the US move in several ways. Programs which they would consider
                        include: improving the penetration capabilities of their strategic ballistic
                        missile systems; expanding their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss> development programs beyond
                        present plans; adopting targeting concepts consistent with a smaller number
                        of key targets, whose defenses they would seek to saturate; placing greater
                        emphasis on strategic <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0282"/>bomber
                        systems and cruise missile submarines, in order to complicate the US
                        defenses; seeking to develop space weapons; and finally, intensifying work
                        on their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program. It should be noted,
                        however, that the Soviets will probably undertake some of these advanced
                        weapons programs even if the US implements no ballistic missile defense
                        program.</p>
                    <p>8. Alternatively, it is possible that, in view of internal Soviet policy
                        debates stemming from the resource demands of the military, the US decision
                        might increase pressures on the Soviet leaders to stabilize some aspects of
                        arms competition. In this context, a simultaneous new offer on arms control
                        might have some prospects. We rate the chances of a positive Soviet
                        reaction, however, as low.</p>
                    <p>9. In any event, we believe that the US decision to deploy ballistic missile
                        defenses, by itself, would not significantly worsen US-Soviet relations. Nor
                        would it be likely to have any direct or basic effect on Soviet policies in
                        existing problem areas, i.e., Vietnam or Berlin. And we believe that the US
                        decision would not change any of the key determinants of Soviet policies
                        toward Western Europe or Communist China.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">

                    </p>
                    <p>10. The Chinese missile and nuclear programs are in such early stages of
                        development that the US decision would have little immediate impact on them.
                        We have estimated that the Chinese could not have an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> strike capability until sometime after
                        1970. Meanwhile, the Chinese would be likely to persist in their efforts to
                        develop a shorter range nuclear capability and proceed to experiment and
                        explore in the field of advanced weapons. If in time, however, the Chinese
                        would come to judge the US ballistic missile defenses as highly effective,
                        they might make only a token deployment of any crude <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> or submarine-launched ballistic missile
                        system which they might develop, while continuing R and D on more
                        sophisticated systems. We believe that the US decision in itself would not
                        cause the Chinese to develop a submarine-launched cruise missile fleet to
                        threaten the US, a program which they might in any event undertake.</p>
                    <p>11. In the political field, Peking would exploit those exaggerated
                        impressions of China’s military strength which would arise from the public
                        discussion of the smaller program as a defense against China. At the same
                        time, the Chinese almost certainly would claim that the US was stepping up
                        its efforts at “nuclear blackmail.” The US decision, however, might increase
                        the anxieties of the Chinese leaders that the US intends ultimately to
                        attack China.</p>

                                might be justified, that the multibillion dollar US expenditures for
                                home defense reflected a further diversion of US strategic interest
                                and support from the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance,
                                that possibilities for security arrangements outside the

                                existing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ties, and greater
                                pressures in London to move away from political support of the US in
                                favor of a more independent role in East-West relations.</p>
                            <p>While these problems may not be insurmountable, the Director of
                                Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes that they
                                would be of greater significance in both the short and longer term
                                than this estimate allows. [Footnote in the source text.]</p>
                        </note> There would be some initial, unfavorable public commentary, stemming
                        primarily from concern over a possible intensification of the arms race and
                        a further diminution of the prospects for East-West detente. This concern
                        would probably be heightened by Soviet political reactions and,
                        particularly, by fears that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                        make drastic responses of a military nature; misconceptions about the
                        limitations and military significance of ballistic missile defenses might
                        add to these fears. The announcement of the decision might be used in some
                        quarters as proof of a shift in US policy toward a “Fortress America”
                        concept, and in others as evidence that the US was beginning to think
                        nuclear war more likely over the longer term. There would also be, however,
                        a large amount of apathy regarding the decision, since most West Europeans
                        of all political leanings regard the likelihood of general nuclear war as
                        remote. In addition, if adequate explanations were given by the US in
                        advance or at the time of the public announcement, unfavorable reactions
                        caused by such attitudes could be dampened.</p>
                    <p>13. Those West European officials who assert there already is a growing
                        divergence between US and West European strategic interests would probably
                        cite the US decision as further justification of their position. If the US
                        announcement of the smaller program emphasized defense against Communist
                        China, critics of US policy would allege that increasing American
                        involvement in Asia would, sooner or later, compel the US to reduce its
                        commitments to Western Europe. De Gaulle <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0284"/>and his supporters would assiduously propagate such views.
                        On the other hand, those governments and officials who favor close relations
                        with the US and continue to place their trust in US willingness to defend
                        Western Europe against a Soviet attack would probably support the US
                        decision. They would regard the deployment of ballistic missile defenses as
                        enhancing American capabilities to deter the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They would probably see no lessening in the ability of
                        the US to inflict unacceptable damage on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even if the Soviets responded by strengthening their
                        offensive missile forces or intensifying work on their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program. Over the longer term, we see
                        little likelihood that the West Europeans would conclude that improved US
                        defenses weakened the deterrents to the outbreak of nuclear war. In general,
                        we believe that the deployment of ballistic missile defenses by the US would
                        not be a major factor in US-West European relationships in the foreseeable
                        future.</p>
                    <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would probably be interested in
                        acquiring missile defenses, but it would not be prepared to spend much money
                        on a deployment program until a highly effective system was available.
                        Although the West German Government would also support the US decision, Bonn
                        would probably be disquieted by the contrast between a nascent US strategic
                        missile defense and its own defenselessness against Soviet missiles. Some
                        West German officials might argue that the risks of general war would no
                        longer be shared equally with the US, and they would be encouraged in this
                        argument by De Gaulle. Thus, the already growing West German desire for more
                        influence in the nuclear strategy of the Western Alliance might in the
                        longer term be further strengthened by the US decision. These same West
                        German officials might even express a desire to acquire missile defenses,
                        but the majority view in the government would probably be against such a
                        step, at least until there was convincing proof that such defenses would
                        actually be effective against the Soviet threat to West Germany.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">IV. Asia</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>15. Asian reactions to the US decision probably would be mixed, but generally
                            mild.<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">Taking into account the negative
                            considerations adduced in paragraphs 15 and 16, the Director of
                            Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes the net
                            assessment reflected in this sentence may be overly reassuring.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Since most Asians are more
                        concerned with the Chinese Communist threat than with that posed by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the fact that the US rated the
                        Chinese nuclear threat as requiring an “anti-Chinese” ballistic missile
                        defense would tend to heighten fears of Communist China in some quarters. On
                        the other hand, some Asians would be likely to view the US decision as
                        further evidence of a continuing <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0285"/>US
                        policy to contain China. At the popular level, there would be even more
                        apathy about the US action than in Western Europe, and any unfavorable
                        public reactions probably would be short-lived. Those Asian governments and
                        officials who now support most US policies would accept the US decision, and
                        those who do not would oppose it. We believe that, on balance, the US
                        decision would have no basic or significant effect on US relations with the
                        Asian nations.</p>
                    <p>16. Over the longer term, as Chinese strategic capabilities became more
                        apparent, India and Australia might wish to obtain ballistic missile
                        defenses from the US, but high costs would probably discourage them. The
                        geographic situation of Taiwan would make its defense against ballistic
                        missiles most difficult; nevertheless, the GRC might seek to acquire such
                        defenses. The Japanese, although not presently as concerned as some other
                        Asians that China poses a military threat to them, might develop an interest
                        in obtaining ballistic missile defenses.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>17. We believe that most of the Latin American and African governments and
                        their peoples would not react strongly, if at all, to the US decision. They
                        would probably see the US move as another manifestation of American military
                        power. In general, however, any US action implying that Communist China had
                        the capability to attack the US with ballistic missiles would considerably
                        upgrade China in the opinion of the Latin Americans and Africans.</p>

                    <p>18. There are, at present, no countries other than the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China which might acquire
                        missile forces which could attack the US and which might have the motivation
                        to do so. The possibility will always exist, nevertheless, that the Soviets
                        or perhaps the Communist Chinese would attain a highly influential
                        relationship with some radical rebel government in the Western Hemisphere,
                        such as was the case with Cuba in 1962, and exploit this relationship to
                        establish missile bases threatening the US.</p>

                            preferred “to postpone setting a date until we have reached a more

                    <p>This matter was discussed extensively within the Department, with the
                        Department of Defense and the White House staff, and with the British
                        Embassy prior to the sending of the letters. It is our view that the
                        President should accept the proposals made, replying to the Prime Minister
                        with separate letters of assent. We believe also that action should be taken
                        concurrently to inform [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                        weapons, i.e. (1) there is to be no alert loading of any aircraft under the

                        period. Even if they have, it seems certain that such decisions will be
                        modified repeatedly in response to changes in military technology, in other

                        <item>Over the next 10 years, we estimate a considerable strengthening of
                            Soviet strategic attack forces, particularly in retaliatory
                            capabilities, with chief emphasis on <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. We do not believe, however, that the Soviets will
                            expect to achieve, within the period of this estimate, forces which
                            would make rational the deliberate initiation of general war. We believe
                            that they will continue to adhere to the concept of a deterrent force. A
                            stress on qualitative factors suggests that the Soviets see
                            technological advance in weapons as a means by <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0290"/>which they can improve their strategic
                            position relative to the West. (Paras. 4–7)<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Deterrence is defined as the prevention from action by fear of the
                                consequences. Deterrence is a state of mind brought about by the
                                existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction.

                                    strategic inferiority, but the intensive Soviet military R and D
                                    effort raises the possibility that Soviet leaders already are
                                    focusing on achievement of a strategic superiority which would
                                    enable more aggressive pursuit of their political aims, perhaps
                                    within the time frame of this estimate.” [Footnote in the source

                            Apparently recognizing its vulnerability, the Soviets are now deploying

                        <item>We estimate that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            force in 1975 will be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 operational
                            launchers. A force near the high side of the range would probably
                            consist primarily of small <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in
                            single silos. By contrast, a force near the low side, though including
                            substantial numbers of small, single silo launchers, would probably
                            incorporate greater qualitative improvement and significant numbers of

                            force leveled off at about 735 operational launchers, some 135 hard,
                            deployed at almost 200 sites. It is capable of delivering a devastating
                            first strike against targets in Eurasia, but like the present <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force it is soft and concentrated. By
                            1975, the Soviets will probably have replaced the major portion of the

                            and on mobile launchers. The flexibility and survivability of such a

                            total of 120–140 tubes. Construction of ballistic missile submarines of
                            current classes ended in 1963. We estimate, however, that the Soviets
                            will produce a new class which could become operational in 1968. It will
                            almost certainly be nuclear powered and will probably carry more
                            missiles than are carried by current classes, perhaps 6–12. A new
                            submarine-launched ballistic missile with a range of about 1,000 n.m.
                            will probably enter service in two or three years, and by 1975 a 2,000
                            n.m. missile may be available. At that time the Soviets will probably
                            have some 60 ballistic missile submarines, including about 20 of a new
                            type. Only recently have Soviet ballistic missile submarines regularly
                            carried out ocean patrols; this activity will increase, and by 1975
                            about 25 percent of the force will probably be on station. (Paras. 47,

                        <item>In recent years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            emphasized construction of cruise missile submarines. The Soviet Navy
                            now has 39–43, including 16–18 nuclear-powered with a total of 195–210
                            launchers. These submarines were initially intended to counter naval
                            task forces, but their mission may be expanded to include land targets.
                            Construction appears to be tapering off, but will probably continue at a
                            reduced rate for several years. By 1975, the Soviets will probably have
                            60–70 cruise missile submarines, possibly including some of a new type.
                            At that time, they will probably also have available new types of cruise
                            missiles. (Paras. 47, 55–57, 65)</item>

                            for Eurasian than for intercontinental operations. This force will
                            decrease gradually through attrition and retirement. The Soviets may
                            develop another new aircraft of medium bomber range, but we believe it
                            unlikely that they will introduce a follow-on heavy bomber into Long
                            Range Aviation. By 1975, the heavy bomber force will probably be reduced
                            to about 50 aircraft, and the medium bomber force to some 250–500,

                            policy of curbing military costs at the expense of the general purpose
                            forces. This change is probably attributable primarily to international
                            tensions arising from the war in Vietnam, but it also reflects the
                            increased influence of the ground force marshals. (Paras. 1–9)</item>

                            the next <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0293"/>ten years. The Soviets
                            will probably improve the capabilities of their general purpose forces
                            for non-nuclear war. The provision of more advanced weapon systems will
                            increase the military effectiveness of the general purpose forces, but
                            will also increase their cost. Over the longer term we foresee some
                            reductions in personnel strength designed to hold this increasing cost
                            within limits acceptable to the Soviet leadership. (Paras. 10–12)</item>

                            equipment. Their peacetime manning levels range from at least 90 percent
                            of war strength in the Soviet forces in Eastern Europe to about 60
                            percent in the interior of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We

                            additional 31 cadre divisions manned at an average of about 20 percent
                            of full strength. Our confidence in these figures is higher than last
                            year as a consequence of more intensive study and new information.

                            believe that as the capabilities of tactical aircraft improve the

                            forces. In 1960 he initiated drastic reductions in their strength. As
                            the result of military opposition, which was strengthened by the Berlin
                            crisis in 1961, these reductions were suspended, but Khrushchev

                            strategic rocket forces. These forces, he held, would also be most
                            effective should deterrence fail, since a general nuclear war would be
                            of short duration and its outcome would be determined by the initial
                            nuclear exchange. Subsequent operations, in his view, could have only
                            minor effects, and large scale theater operations would be inconceivable
                            in the aftermath of a massive nuclear exchange.</item>

                        <item>Khrushchev’s views were strongly opposed by the military establishment
                            in general. The more conservative marshals vigorously defended the
                            utility of large general purpose forces, contending that large-scale and
                            protracted land campaigns would be indispensable for victory in a
                            general nuclear war; they concluded, not that these forces had no
                            further role to play, but rather that they faced new and demanding
                            requirements. The position eventually adopted by most important Soviet
                            military leaders, including Marshal Malinovskiy, was a compromise. This
                            accepted the decisiveness of nuclear weapons and the probability that a
                            general war would be short, but it also held that such a war might be
                            protracted and that the requirement for large theater forces continued
                            into the nuclear era.</item>

                        <item>The men who displaced Khrushchev face the same problems that
                            confronted him regarding the proper allocation of Soviet resources. They
                            are no less concerned than he to promote economic growth and to
                            strengthen Soviet strategic attack and defense capabilities, but they
                            appear to have relaxed the pressure which he exerted to limit
                            expenditures for the general purpose forces. This change is probably
                            attributable primarily to the increased international tensions arising
                            from the war in Vietnam, but it reflects also the increased influence of
                            the Soviet marshals.</item>

                        <item>The recent restoration of Marshal Chuykov to command of the ground
                            forces is the most definite indication of a change in policy. He is a
                            strong advocate of the maintenance of large ground forces. His bold
                            public defense of his views when he was relieved of that command in 1964
                            made his return to it unlikely unless there had been a change in policy
                            in the direction which he advocated. Consequently we believe there will
                            be a slight increase in the strength of Soviet general purpose forces,
                            and that they will number some two million men by the end of 1965.<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">The numbers and distribution of manpower in

                        <item>Khrushchev’s fall was accompanied by expressions of military
                            disapproval of his preoccupation with nuclear armed missiles to the
                            detriment of other military requirements. Ever since 1961 there have
                            been indications of a growing acceptance of the possibility of
                            non-nuclear conflict between nuclear powers. In June of this year
                            Marshal Rotmistrov, predicting a nuclear stalemate between the US and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, suggested that the ground
                            forces might again become the decisive factor, in either a nuclear or a
                            non-nuclear situation. Twice within the past six months Marshal
                            Malinovskiy has spoken of the possibility of a non-nuclear war. Marshal
                            Sokolovskiy recently observed that a situation of nuclear stalemate
                            requires constant reappraisal of the relative roles of strategic and
                            general purpose forces.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Thus the Soviet conviction that any conflict between nuclear powers
                            must inevitably and quickly escalate into general nuclear war is now
                            undergoing some modification. We believe that the Soviet leaders are
                            increasingly prepared to contemplate the possibility of non-nuclear
                            warfare between nuclear powers. Nevertheless, they almost certainly
                            still consider that any conflict with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Europe would carry grave risk of escalation to
                            general nuclear war.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>There has been no perceptible weakening of Soviet insistence that the
                            use of tactical nuclear weapons in limited war would trigger a <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0296"/>strategic exchange. While this
                            doctrine serves deterrent purposes in part, it also represents an
                            apparent Soviet conviction that escalation under such circumstances
                            would be well-nigh uncontrollable. We do not believe that Soviet
                            doctrine regarding the limited use of nuclear weapons will change in the
                            foreseeable future, and we consider it highly unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would initiate the use of such
                            weapons in a limited conflict. If the Western powers were to do so, we
                            believe that, doctrine notwithstanding, the Soviets would seek to
                            prevent escalation to general war.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>There have been no major changes in deployment of Soviet general
                            purpose forces during the past year. However, after the collapse of
                            border talks between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China in August 1964, Soviet forces on the Manchurian border
                            were strengthened by a motorized rifle division which was probably
                            redeployed from the western <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                            Moreover, within the past year, internal shifts in the Far East moved
                            elements of two other Soviet divisions closer to the Chinese border.
                            Khrushchev’s successors have avoided reopening the territorial issue,
                            and the border problem appears to have lapsed into a state of armed
                            quiescence. However, the Soviet units moved there in last year’s crisis
                            remain in position.</item>

                        <item>Revisions in the force levels, organization, and deployment of the
                            general purpose forces are virtually certain to occur in the course of
                            the next ten years. Such changes are more likely to result from
                            technical military and economic considerations than from external
                            political developments. A substantial relaxation of tensions between the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the West would tend to
                            aggravate tensions between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            Communist China, and vice versa. Hence the Soviet authorities are not
                            likely to find in the development of the international situation any
                            warrant for a substantial reduction in general purpose forces, although
                            the degree of tension may have marginal effects, as in the Berlin crisis
                            of 1961.</item>
                        <label>11.</label>
                        <item>Economic considerations will continue to be a major factor affecting
                            the development of the general purpose forces. The provision of more
                            advanced weapon systems will increase their military effectiveness, but
                            will also increase their cost. Over the longer term we foresee some
                            reductions in personnel strength designed to hold this increasing cost
                            within limits acceptable to the Soviet leadership.</item>
                        <label>12.</label>
                        <item>The principal changes over the next decade will probably be in the
                            structure of the general purpose forces, particularly if the Soviets
                            should decide to emphasize preparation for contingencies other than
                            general nuclear war. Such a decision would imply, among other changes, a
                            smaller number of larger divisions and increased provisions <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0297"/>for combat and logistic support. Some
                            restructuring along these lines is probable, but it is likely to occur
                            only very gradually.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">I. Introduction</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panel has reviewed the current Army-BTL proposal to deploy a ballistic
                        missile defense system capable of defending the United States against
                        unsophisticated or light ballistic missile attacks. The Panel understands
                        that the system, which consists of a high altitude, area defense for the
                        entire country and a limited deployment of terminal Nike-X defense for high
                        value targets, is primarily directed against a future Chinese nuclear
                        capability and is intended to insure that the United States will be
                        essentially invulnerable to Chinese nuclear attack for a considerable period
                        of time. At the same time, the system is specifically <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0300"/>designed to permit growth to meet more
                        massive and more sophisticated forms of ballistic missile threat from any
                        quarter.</p>
                    <p>If the decision to deploy is made in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1967,
                        the Army estimates that the proposed system would have an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> in 1970 and would be completely deployed by
                        1973 at a cost of from $8 to $12 billion, depending on the number of
                        locations defended by terminal defense.</p>
                    <p>In its deliberations, the Panel was deeply conscious of the fact that
                        deploying a ballistic missile defense system is one of the most important
                        military systems decisions that the United States has ever had to face.
                        There is full agreement that the threat to American and world security posed
                        by the emerging Chinese nuclear capability will be extremely serious.</p>
                    <p>There would clearly be considerable military and political advantages in a
                        defense system that could insure that this country would not be subject to
                        Chinese blackmail threats and, more important, that would give the
                        government greater flexibility in its dealings with the Chinese Communists
                        by denying them even a minimal nuclear deterrent for a great many years to
                        come.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the magnitude of the commitment, the concept of a secure
                        defensive shield against Chinese strategic attack could in the long run
                        involve much greater expenditures for continental defense than those
                        required simply for the proposed limited deployment. Future extensive
                        deployment of Nike-X terminal defense (particularly since “growth potential”
                        is a design requirement) would probably follow. Moreover, to achieve a tight
                        defense, substantial additional expenditures would be required for <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> and air defense to plug obvious loopholes
                        in the proposed Army-BTL system. Finally, if as a consequence of deployment
                        of the Army-BTL system we become interested in the possibility of defense
                        against more massive threats, a substantial expansion of our civil defense
                        program would surely have to be considered.</p>
                    <p>The Panel has examined on technical and military grounds whether the proposed
                        Army-BTL system is designed correctly to match the evolution of the Chinese
                        strategic nuclear threat. At the same time, there appear to be far-reaching
                        military, economic and political consequences of the decision to deploy
                        ballistic missile defense that may be to the long-term net disadvantage of
                        the United States. The proposed system would have considerable capability
                        against the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force in its
                        present configuration. The Soviets must therefore react to U.S. deployment
                        of such a system in order to maintain their deterrent (or their capacity for
                        assured destruction) at the present level. This reaction would most
                        logically involve the development and deployment of penetration aids in the
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force but might well also in
                        the longer term push the Soviets to higher levels of strategic force
                        deployment, to which we, in turn, might well react.</p>
                    <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0301"/>
                    <p>A decision to deploy could also have a significant effect on our allies in
                        Europe and Asia. It is not clear whether it would increase their confidence
                        in our resolve to defend them or their fear that we were abandoning them
                        while constructing a Fortress America. The question would probably have to
                        be faced as to whether we were prepared to assist our allies in obtaining a
                        similar defense. Finally, a decision now to spend $8 to $12 billion to
                        defend ourselves against a Chinese strategic threat would probably enhance
                        China’s military stature in the eyes of the world years before China could
                        actually have a real nuclear strategic capability, and at a time when we
                        have been attempting to minimize the significance of the Chinese threat.
                        What effect this would have on the actions of our allies and neutrals in
                        Asia requires careful examination. Finally, the question arises why we
                        should consider undertaking a massive expansion of our strategic defensive
                        forces in the face of a relatively weak Chinese threat when we have not
                        chosen to do so against our much stronger Soviet opponent. Our intent would
                        presumably be to maintain a defensive military posture against the Chinese
                        capable of denying them any deterrent capability whatever for at least a
                        limited period of time. We never achieved this posture with respect to the
                        Soviet Union; however, it may be possible to achieve it against the Chinese
                        because of our great technological advantage.</p>
                    <p>In its deliberations, the Panel has attempted to focus on the technical
                        aspects of the problem. The Panel recognizes, however, that some of the
                        broader issues noted above must weigh heavily in any final decision on
                        deployment of a ballistic missile defense system.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">II. Chinese Threat</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At present, the Chinese clearly have no <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and, for practical purposes, no intercontinental aircraft.
                        They do have fission bombs; a Chinese copy of a Soviet ballistic missile
                        type submarine (although it may not have any missiles); short-range cruise
                        missiles; and an active ballistic missile development program, which
                        includes a missile test range of about one thousand nautical mile range,
                        static firing stands, and probably Chinese copies of the Soviet SS–4/<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>. They also have a very strong motivation
                        both to expand their ballistic missile submarine force and to develop an
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability.</p>
                    <p>The general thinking in the intelligence community is that the Chinese may
                        have a limited ballistic missile submarine capability in the latter part of
                        this decade and that an initial Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability might appear as early as in the 1970–1975 time
                        period. However, there is also agreement that it is not possible to estimate
                        with any accuracy at this time the evolution of the Chinese nuclear
                        strategic threat during the next decade.</p>

                            Threat</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The proposed Army-BTL system, which basically consists of components
                        originally designed to provide a full-scale defense against the Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat, appears, on the one hand,
                        inadequate to cope with an initial Chinese capability composed of
                        submarine-launched ballistic and air breathing missiles and, on the other
                        hand, more effective than necessary for defense against the early Chinese
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>The concept of the proposed system is that the high altitude area defense
                        would essentially defend the entire country against unsophisticated small
                        attacks and that terminal Nike-X defense, deployed only at “high value”
                        targets, would cover any leakage and would also provide additional defense
                        against submarine-launched ballistic missiles in the case of coastal
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>The area defense component of the system could provide a very effective
                        defense against the initial Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        capability which probably would not be equipped with adequate penetration
                        aids. It is designed to acquire targets at 1600 n.m. and to launch
                        interceptors when the target is 1000 n.m. away so that interception takes
                        place at ranges up to about 300 n.m. from the defensive missile launching
                        sites and at altitudes of 300,000 feet or higher. [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2
                            lines of source text not declassified</hi>] This should give relatively
                        high confidence of kill against individual warheads with limited penetration
                        aids.</p>
                    <p>The area defense component of the proposed system can be expected to cope
                        with some 15 to 30 individual warheads directed against a given contiguous
                        target area before exhaustion of its interceptors. Thus, although the
                        defense can always be overwhelmed in any one area by a large attack, the
                        area component could provide a very high confidence defense against an
                        initial small Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force with
                        limited penetration aids. However, since there is no discrimination in the
                        area component of the system, it can probably be exhausted by the use of
                        light relatively unsophisticated, unhardened, exo-atmospheric decoys.
                        Although there is considerable debate as to exactly how simple it is to
                        develop such decoys, it seems unlikely that the earliest Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s would be so equipped. However, this
                        would be the natural path of Chinese development to counter an area defense,
                        and one probably could not count on a very extended effective life of such a
                        system.</p>
                    <p>The terminal defense component, which uses atmospheric discrimination and
                        rapid response Sprint missiles, also would have no difficulty at defended
                        locations in handling the initial Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat since it was originally designed to deal with
                        relatively sophisticated missiles. However, against the initial Chinese
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat, the terminal defense
                        component appears somewhat redundant, when coupled with the area defense
                        system. With the development of exo-atmospheric <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0303"/>decoys, widely dispersed, the terminal defense component
                        would become essential for the system to be effective. In that situation, it
                        seems clear that the constraints imposed on the offense to penetrate both
                        area and terminal defense would exact a heavy price in payload on target,
                        and it would probably take the Chinese many years to acquire this
                        capability. It should be noted, however, that initially the Army-BTL system
                        provides terminal defense for only a limited number of U.S. cities. Thus it
                        must be recognized that, if the Chinese are able to penetrate our area
                        defense, they can always damage us by attacking the “n + 1” city in any
                        system designed to defend “n” cities. Therefore, only a deployment of
                        terminal defense batteries much more extensive than that contemplated in the
                        Army-BTL proposal can in the long term hope to accomplish the original
                        objective of an essentially invulnerable defense of the U.S. against the
                        Chinese; even such a defense can eventually be penetrated. Consequently, at
                        some point in the future it would presumably be necessary to accept a
                        “damage-limiting” and “assured destruction” posture with respect to the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Considering the submarine threat, the Panel believes that both the area and
                        the terminal components of the system are vulnerable to such attacks.
                        Neither component has any capability against air breathing cruise missiles
                        flying at low altitudes. The area system would also be ineffective against
                        submarine-based ballistic missiles launched on minimum energy trajectories
                        of less than 100 n.m. More important is the fact that a 350 n.m. missile,
                        which is the normal armament of the Soviet G-class submarine of which the
                        Chinese have produced one copy, would be invisible to the area defense when
                        launched at 100 n.m. The defense would thus have to rely on the terminal
                        component, which in turn could not cope with missiles launched at distances
                        of less than about 50 n.m.</p>
                    <p>If our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> is as ineffective as some people
                        fear, this means that there is a loophole to the proposed system that could
                        probably be exploited by the Chinese with what might be their initial
                        capability. If, on the other hand, our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        forces are more able and can be made more effective to handle the Chinese
                        submarine threat than is now apparent, then the need for a defense against
                        submarine-launched missiles is decreased. However, even if <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> becomes relatively effective, it would
                        appear that some form of advanced “air defense” such as <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-D will probably also be required to plug
                        the loophole in the proposed Army-BTL system posed by submarine-launched
                        ballistic and air breathing missiles. This raises the question as to whether
                        a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-D-type system alone or in combination
                        with an improved <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> posture is not the
                        correct answer to the submarine threat.</p>

                    <p>The proposed Army-BTL system clearly also has considerable capability against
                        the present Soviet threat. No matter how much we <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0304"/>advertise the fact that the defense is directed at the
                        Chinese, the Soviet Union and the rest of the world will probably consider
                        that the principal significance of the system relates to its impact on the
                        U.S.-Soviet strategic nuclear confrontation.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, the area defense component of the proposed Army-BTL
                        system would be quite effective against Soviet re-entry vehicles since the
                        Soviet Union has apparently not yet decided to deploy penetration aids, nor
                        is there even any evidence of a Soviet penetration aids development program.
                        Rapid U.S. deployment of an area defense (in particular, the simplified
                        system discussed below) might lead the Soviet deployment of penetration aids
                        by a year or two if the Soviets were slow to react, and it might buy us a
                        short but possibly significant strategic advantage. However, it seems
                        extremely improbable that the Soviets would not soon be able to equip their
                        force with the penetration aids required to overcome an area defense.</p>
                    <p>There do not appear to be any developments implicit in the proposed system
                        that would in any way change the unfavorable exchange ratio with Soviet
                        offensive forces previously estimated for the Nike-X terminal defense system
                        although analysis of the combined area and terminal defense has not been
                        carried out.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>A decision to deploy the proposed Army-BTL system would probably not
                        initially result in a major political reaction on the part of the Soviets
                        since they seem to accept defensive systems as natural militarily. However,
                        if they have either not decided to deploy a ballistic missile defense system
                        of their own or have decided on only a limited deployment for the general
                        Moscow-Leningrad area, our decision to deploy might well influence them to
                        undertake a full-scale ballistic missile defense. More important, for the
                        long term, it would appear that such a decision on our part might well push
                        the Soviets to higher strategic force levels, both qualitatively and
                        quantitatively. Such an increase in Soviet force levels would probably again
                        put pressure on the U.S. to expand its strategic forces.</p>
                    <p>The possibility that the Soviets may announce during the coming year that
                        they are actually deploying a ballistic missile defense system is an added
                        problem that must be weighed in deciding whether or not to deploy a system
                        of our own. Despite the accumulation of information that may relate to this
                        activity, it is still uncertain as to what the Soviets are actually doing.
                        The Soviets may already actually be engaged in a limited deployment of a
                        ballistic missile defense system. In any event, it is clear that the Soviet
                        activities that may be related to ballistic missile <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0305"/>defense and, in particular, to deployment
                        have been substantially expanded throughout the last year.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviet Union were to announce to the world the deployment of a
                        ballistic missile defense, which it claimed was very effective, the domestic
                        political pressures for a similar action on our part would certainly be
                        increased. Moreover, if such announcement by the Soviets were to occur
                        during a major confrontation with this country, it might have a significant
                        impact on world opinion. On the other hand, the Soviet Union has frequently
                        claimed successful development, if not deployment, of an effective ballistic
                        missile defense and has, in fact, intensified through recent pronouncements
                        and a much-publicized film that they have a ballistic missile defense
                        capability. World reaction to all these claims has been minimal.</p>
                    <p>There is little question but that the proper military counter to a Soviet
                        ballistic missile defense system would be to improve the capability of the
                        U.S. strategic forces to penetrate, in particular by the incorporation of
                        improved penetration aids in our existing missile force. This would have the
                        effect of assuring that we maintain the same basic deterrence posture
                        relative to the Soviet Union that exists at present.</p>
                    <p>The Panel believes the probability is sufficiently great that either the
                        Soviets will announce, or we will discover, the existence of a deployed
                        Soviet ballistic missile defense system in the next year or two so that
                        there should be a greatly increased effort to assure that we are in a
                        position to incorporate appropriate penetration aids in our strategic
                        missile systems as rapidly as necessary. In the past, the Services,
                        particularly the Air Force, have been slow in developing programs for the
                        incorporation of penetration aids despite continued pressure from <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>. Programs for penetration aids,
                        specifically aimed at countering potential Soviet ballistic missile defense
                        systems, have now been evolved by the Services and we hope that rapid
                        progress will be made.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There is considerable uncertainty about the time schedule of the emerging
                        Chinese strategic nuclear threat. One may imagine that it will appear late
                        (i.e., after 1973, the time of complete deployment of the Army-BTL system,
                        were the go-ahead given now) or it might appear early, say in 1970. This
                        uncertainty in the threat raises serious questions regarding the deployment
                        of the Army-BTL system, and we discuss these questions below.</p>
                    <p>Because of the possible early threat, the Panel is concerned with the length
                        of time required for deployment of the proposed system. In fact, the time to
                        achieve the performance as predicted in the proposed Army-BTL system may be
                        considerably longer than assumed, considering the advanced technology
                        involved.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0306"/>
                    <p>The Panel believes that it may be technically feasible to obtain a useful
                        area defense against the plausible initial Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability with shorter deployment time and at much lower
                        cost than that of the proposed Army-BTL system. The high cost of the
                        Army-BTL system is largely a consequence of overdesign in the attempt to
                        build a growth capability into the system by means of a terminal component
                        that is not really required initially. For example, the use of the very
                        expensive <gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss>s at the Zeus missile farms is
                        closely coupled to the requirements for terminal defense.</p>
                    <p>The Panel considered a simplified area defense in which the Minimar and
                            <gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss> radars were omitted from the system.
                        Acquisition could be achieved by <gloss target="#t_VHF1">VHF</gloss> (150
                        megacycles) or <gloss target="#t_UHF1">UHF</gloss> (400 megacycles) radars
                        such as those used in <gloss target="#t_SPADATS1">SPADATS</gloss>; and the
                        defensive Zeus missiles could be controlled by <gloss target="#t_MTR1">MTR</gloss>s, or by inertial guidance. The effects of blackout,
                        including self blackout, particularly on the <gloss target="#t_VHF1">VHF</gloss> radars, as well as the feasibility of using light decoys to
                        penetrate the defense, would have to be considered in detail in evaluating
                        such a system. A system of this variety would cost substantially less than
                        the proposed Army-BTL system, perhaps as little as $1 billion, and could
                        involve only “off-the-shelf” hardware. It could surely be deployed more
                        quickly than the proposed Army-BTL defense.</p>
                    <p>Although the over-all capabilities of such a simplified system would clearly
                        be less than the Army-BTL system, it would probably be as effective as the
                        Army-BTL system in dealing with the early Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat. The Panel believes that more detailed study will
                        probably show that such a simplified system is feasible and that it can in
                        fact be rapidly deployed. The ability to deploy such a system would provide
                        an effective hedge against an early Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment. With this hedge, we would have more time to
                        resolve the uncertainties in our intelligence on the Chinese nuclear
                        strategic threat and in the technology of ballistic missile defense.</p>
                    <p>It is also important to recognize that our massive strategic offensive forces
                        provide additional safeguards against the early Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat. In the face of these U.S. forces,
                        a few unhardened and easily located Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s would not constitute a very plausible blackmail threat or
                        deterrent capability. Provided our defenses against the Chinese submarine
                        missile threat are effective, the U.S. by taking preemptive action could be
                        protected with a high level of confidence against the initial Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. The level of confidence in such a
                        preemptive disarming attack would of course decrease as the level of the
                        Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force increases.</p>
                    <p>In this context and with a rapidly-deployable simplified system as a hedge,
                        the Panel believes that we will have sufficient time to react to the Chinese
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat as it becomes more
                        apparent. In addition, there <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0307"/>is an
                        actual danger that a premature decision to deploy a defensive system would
                        permit the Chinese to build around it if they are not already firmly
                        committed to their future strategic systems. They might, for example, give
                        additional emphasis to submarine or ship-launched missiles instead of
                        undertaking an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> program. Moreover, the
                        sooner the Chinese are clearly faced with the problem of having to penetrate
                        a high altitude area defense the sooner we can expect them to introduce
                        exo-atmospheric penetration aids into their evolving <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force.</p>
                    <p>For all of the reasons discussed above, the Panel does not believe that there
                        should be a decision this year to deploy the proposed Army-BTL system.</p>

                        the Army-BTL system are being considered in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>One such proposal is to make a firm decision to deploy the Army-BTL system at
                        a time dictated by the future evolution of the Chinese strategic nuclear
                        threat. On this basis the actual funding of the deployment decision would be
                        delayed for at least one year. This proposal is presumably based on the idea
                        that the announcement of such a decision would be of some domestic value in
                        allaying criticism that the Administration was not reacting to the Chinese
                        threat and to undercut the impact of any Soviet announcement that they were
                        deploying such a system. The Panel believes that this proposal would present
                        us with all of the problems inherent in the decision to deploy a ballistic
                        missile system without doing anything to advance the day when a defensive
                        system would be available. Moreover, it would tend to tie us unnecessarily
                        to a specific system at a time when technology is changing very rapidly. The
                        Panel finds very little to recommend this proposal.</p>
                    <p>A second proposal that is being considered is to postpone the formal
                        deployment decision but to spend some $200 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1967 for long lead time items. It is argued that this action
                        would, in essence, save one year in both the <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> and full deployment times if it is subsequently decided to
                        deploy the Army-BTL system. On examination, it appears that the $200 million
                        in question is essentially equivalent to the full first-year expenditures
                        for the deployment of the system. This expenditure really amounts to
                        building up in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1967 the organization that
                        would be necessary in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1968 to spend $1.2
                        billion. This type of operation would make it more difficult next year to
                        decide against deployment. This action would also tie us very closely to the
                        specifics of the proposed Army-BTL system and would make it much more
                        difficult to continue objective study of the problem since efforts would of
                        necessity be focused on the very difficult management problem of building an
                            <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0308"/>organization capable of
                        directing the single most complex military system ever undertaken. Although
                        it is argued that this action would defer the political repercussions that
                        may be involved in a formal deployment decision, the world at large would
                        probably interpret this action as a decision on our part to deploy the
                        Army-BTL system.</p>
                    <p>On balance, the Panel does not believe it would be wise to initiate the
                        program for the procurement of long lead time items in the absence of a
                        decision to deploy.</p>

                        the newly-created Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems Analysis) from
                        1965 to 1969), summarized the strategic thinking of Department of Defense
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>In determining strategic force requirements, the two wrote that U.S. defense
                        officials decided that the “assured destruction” capability of U.S.
                        strategic offensive nuclear forces would be sufficient to destroy 20 to 25
                        percent of the Soviet population and 50 percent of Soviet industry. This was
                        a “judgment reached by the Secretary of Defense and accepted by the
                        President, by the Congress, and apparently by the general public as well.”
                        Studies by the Systems Analysis Office concluded that following a Soviet
                        nuclear attack, U.S. retaliation with 100 1-megaton-equivalent
                        U.S.-delivered nuclear warheads would kill about 37 million people (15
                        percent of the total Soviet population) and destroy 59 percent of Soviet
                        industrial capacity. Doubling the megaton delivery to 200 would increase the
                        percentages to 21 percent fatalities and 72 percent industrial capacity
                        destroyed. Higher levels would increase the destructive percentages, but the
                        returns would be sharply diminishing compared with the expense involved.
                        (Ibid., page 207) The studies of the Systems Analysis Office also concluded
                        that the number of U.S. and Soviet citizens killed in a nuclear exchange
                        would be very high, regardless of whether the United States had no <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense system, an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense of 25 cities, or defense of some 52 cities. (Ibid.,

                    <p>This year we have given special attention to an analysis of threats over and
                        above those projected in the latest National Intelligence Estimates of
                        Soviet strategic offensive and defensive forces. We have done so because
                        recent technological progress on our part, which if duplicated by the
                        Soviets and incorporated in their strategic forces, could pose a new and
                        much more severe threat to our Assured Destruction capability than
                        postulated in the NIEs. This threat would arise, for example, if the Soviet
                        Union were to deploy simultaneously a force of new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s equipped with highly accurate, multiple, independently
                        aimed re-entry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) and a
                        reasonably sophisticated anti-ballistic missile system. Although we do not
                        now consider this to be a likely contingency, it does lie within their
                        technical capabilities over the next ten years and could require some major
                        changes in our strategic offensive forces in the future.</p>
                    <p>There are seven major issues involved in our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967–71 programs for the general nuclear war forces. The
                        first five are related primarily to the threat projected in the latest
                        National Intelligence Estimates. The last two are associated with the
                        possibility of a more severe threat. These issues are:</p>

                                capability, including the Short Range Air-to-Surface Missile (<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>). FB–111 is estimated for the
                                fourth quarter of 1968 and the build-up is to be completed by June
                                1971. The FB–111/<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> program will

                    <p>[Here follows a table of contents.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">A. The General Nuclear War Problem</p>
                    <p>Last year in my memorandum to you on the same subject I pointed out that our
                        general nuclear war forces should have two basic capabilities: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>To deter deliberate nuclear attack upon the United States and its
                                Allies by maintaining a clear and convincing capability to inflict
                                unacceptable damage on an attacker, even if that attacker were to
                                strike first;</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>In the event such a war nevertheless occurred, to limit damage to
                                our population and industrial capacity. The first of these
                                capabilities we call “Assured Destruction” and the second “Damage
                                Limitation”.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Assured Destruction involves the maintenance on a continuous basis of a
                        highly reliable ability to inflict an unacceptable degree of damage, even
                        after absorbing a first strike, upon any single aggressor or combination of
                        aggressors, independently of warning, and at any time during the course of a
                        strategic nuclear exchange. This capability is the vital first objective
                        which <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0313"/>must be met in full by our
                        strategic nuclear forces since it would ensure, with a high degree of
                        confidence, that we could deter under all circumstances a calculated,
                        deliberate nuclear attack upon the United States. Although we cannot and
                        need not state with precision what kinds and amounts of destruction we would
                        have to be able to inflict on an aggressor in order to provide this
                        assurance, whatever that level may be, it must be provided regardless of the
                        costs or the difficulties involved.</p>
                    <p>Once high confidence of an Assured Destruction capability has been provided,
                        we should then consider additional forces and measures which would allow us
                        to reduce the damage to our population and industry in the event deterrence
                        fails. The level of the threat against which we might design Damage Limiting
                        postures may range all the way from that posed by a minor nuclear power—for
                        example, the Chinese Communists in the 1970s—to that posed by the Soviet
                        Union in a carefully synchronized first strike against our urban areas.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Damage Limiting problem posed by the Soviet nuclear
                        threat, I believe it would be useful to restate briefly certain basic
                        considerations which have guided our programs over the last several years: <list>
                            <item>First, against the forces we expect the Soviets to have during the
                                next decade, it would be virtually impossible for us to be able to
                                ensure anything approaching perfect protection for our population,
                                no matter how large the general nuclear war forces we were to
                                provide, even if we were to strike first. The Soviets clearly have
                                the technical and economic capacity to prevent us from achieving a
                                posture which could keep our fatalities below some tens of millions;
                                in a Soviet first strike they could do this at an extra cost to them
                                substantially less than the extra cost to us of any additional
                                Damage Limiting measures we might take.</item>
                            <item>Second, since each of the three types of Soviet strategic
                                offensive systems (land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles
                                and manned bombers) could, by itself, inflict severe damage on the
                                United States, even a “very good” defense against only one type of
                                system has only limited value.</item>
                            <item>Third, for any given level of Soviet offensive capability,
                                successive additions to each of our various Damage Limiting systems
                                have diminishing marginal value. The same principle holds for the
                                Damage Limiting force as a whole; as additional forces are added,
                                the incremental gain in effectiveness diminishes.</item>

                    <p>With respect to the Damage Limiting problem posed by an Nth country nuclear
                        threat, e.g., Communist China in the 1970s, it now appears to be technically
                        feasible to design a defense system which would have a reasonably high
                        probability of avoiding any substantial damage. The deployment of such a
                        system might also contribute to our objective of control of proliferation by
                        strengthening the credibility of a possible U.S. commitment to come to the
                        assistance of a friendly nation confronted by an Nth country <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0314"/>nuclear threat. It might also deter the
                        threatened or actual use of nuclear weapons by Nth countries acting
                        independently of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>It was with these considerations in mind that we have carefully evaluated the
                        major alternatives available to us in meeting the two strategic objectives
                        of our general nuclear war forces—Assured Destruction and Damage
                        Limitation.</p>
                    <p rend="center">B. Capabilities of Our Forces Against the Expected Threat</p>
                    <p>In order to assess the capabilities of our general nuclear war forces over
                        the next several years, we must take into account the size and character, of
                        the forces the Soviets are likely to have during the same period.</p>

                    <p>While we have reasonably high confidence in our estimates of the size and
                        composition of the Soviets’ strategic offensive and defensive forces for the
                        near future, many details concerning the technical and lethal
                        characteristics of their weapon systems are less certain. Also, estimates
                        for the latter part of this decade and the early part of the next decade
                        are, of course, subject to great uncertainties.</p>

                            <p>Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles</p>
                            <p>At present the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force is
                                deployed on 224 operational launchers, 146 of which are soft and 78
                                of which are hard and configured in a triple-silo pattern. As
                                reported last year the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s—all of
                                which are liquid fueled—are designated the SS–6, SS–7, and SS–8.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets are constructing at least two types of single silo launch
                                sites. We believe that the large payload (9,000–11,000 lbs) liquid
                                fueled SS–9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, which we
                                expect to become operational in 1966, will be deployed in the larger
                                silos and that the SS–11 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, a
                                small storable liquid fueled missile, also estimated to become
                                operational in 1966, is intended for the smaller silos. While we
                                have anticipated the development of a solid-fuel Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system, we are certain that as of
                                this time, a full-scale flight test program for such a missile has
                                not been undertaken. Accordingly, with the cessation of SS–6/7/8
                                deployment programs, major additions over the next few years to the
                                operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force would
                                consist of the SS–9 and SS–11.</p>
                            <p>By mid-1967, the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force
                                is estimated to total between 420–476 operational launchers.
                                Compared with the Soviet missile force at mid-1965, this would be an
                                increase of 60 to 70 SS–9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                                launchers and 140 to 180 SS–11 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                                launchers.</p>
                            <p>In our estimates last year, we projected a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of some 400–700 operational
                                launchers for mid-1970. Because of the relatively early introduction
                                of the single silo basing configuration our present estimate for
                                mid-1970 is a minimum of 500 and a maximum of perhaps 700 to 800
                                operational launchers, with the bulk of the force probably
                                consisting of small payload missiles.</p>
                            <p>While it is possible that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force could expand in the later years of this
                                decade at a higher rate than we now estimate, present-deployment
                                trends and economic, strategic and technical considerations would
                                not appear to support a higher estimate.</p>

                                and IRBM (2200 n.mi.) forces appears to be completed with about 735
                                operational launchers, 135 of which are hard. We estimate that the
                                size of this force will remain relatively constant through the
                                mid-1967 period. Improvements through mid-1970 will probably include
                                the deployment of solid fueled <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0316"/>missiles (although no flight test program has been
                                identified), some mobile units phasing out of the soft sites.</p>

                            <p>The trend in Soviet submarine construction is still not very clear.
                                However, new programs under development or in production are not
                                likely to affect Soviet missile submarine strength for the next few
                                years. The Soviet Navy now has some 43 to 48 ballistic missile
                                submarines with a total of 120–140 tubes. Only 8 to 10 of these
                                submarines are nuclear powered and only 2 or 3 of these carry the
                                700 n.mi. SS–N–5 submerged launch missile. All of the other
                                operational Soviet ballistic missile submarines contain the 300 mile
                                surface-launch SS–N–4 missile. Only recently have the Soviet
                                ballistic missile submarines regularly carried out ocean patrols,
                                but these appear to be to staging areas rather than to strike
                                stations.</p>
                            <p>Because of construction lead times, no change in the force level of
                                Soviet ballistic missile submarines is now projected through
                                mid-1967. However, it is estimated that by 1968 the Soviets could
                                have a nuclear powered submarine capable of launching 6 to 12
                                salvo-fired, 1,000 n.mi. missiles. By mid-1970 they could have as
                                many as seven of these boats.</p>
                            <p>Although the Soviets do not appear to consider the cruise missile
                                submarine as primarily a strategic attack system, they now have 39
                                to 43 such boats equipped with 350 n.mi. missiles, 16 to 18 of which
                                are nuclear powered. We estimate that the Soviets will continue to
                                build a limited number each year of both conventional and nuclear
                                cruise missile submarines.</p>

                            <p>There is still no evidence that the Soviets intend to deploy a new
                                heavy bomber in the late sixties. The force currently consists of
                                some 200 heavy and 800 medium bombers, some of which are used as
                                tankers. It is estimated that the Soviets will continue to maintain
                                their heavy bomber force through mid-1967 although attrition would
                                reduce this force to about 75 percent of the current level by the
                                end of the decade. It is estimated that the medium bomber force will
                                continue to decline gradually as older aircraft are phased out
                                faster than the new Blinders are delivered.</p>
                            <p>As indicated last year, the Soviets’ capability for intercontinental
                                bomber attack remains limited. Considering the requirements for
                                Arctic staging, refueling and noncombat attrition, we estimate that
                                the Soviets could currently place only slightly more than 100 heavy
                                bombers over target areas in the U.S. on two-way missions. While we
                                believe that medium bombers do not figure prominently in Soviet
                                plans for an initial attack on the U.S., a limited force of Badgers
                                could attack targets in Greenland, Canada, Alaska and the extreme
                                northwest U.S. on two-way missions.</p>

                            <p>The current operational strength of the Soviets’ fighter-interceptor
                                forces is estimated at 3,800 aircraft, of which more than 70 percent
                                are older models. However, these aircraft are gradually being
                                replaced by new generation fighters with both all-weather and
                                air-to-air missile capabilities. There is also evidence that
                                high-speed Mach 3 follow-on interceptors are in an early development
                                stage.</p>

                            <p>The SA–2 deployment within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                was virtually completed in 1963–64 with some 800–900 sites, less
                                than we had previously estimated. However, there is evidence that
                                through a successive series of modifications, the low altitude
                                intercept capability of some of these sites has been improved to
                                about l,500 feet. The SA–3 system, estimated to have been designed
                                against the low altitude threat (also 1,000 feet), continues to be
                                deployed at a slow pace and is not expected to grow much beyond its
                                current size of about 110 sites.</p>

                            <p>We had at one time estimated that the Soviets were constructing an
                                anti-missile defense system which might be operational at Leningrad
                                as early as mid-1965 and at Moscow about mid-1967. Numerous
                                indications point to Soviet difficulties with this program with a
                                series of changes and modifications in related facilities and
                                equipment at their test ranges. Activity at deployment locations has
                                been sporadic, rather than part of an all out, high priority
                                effort.</p>
                            <p>While we had previously thought that all these activities were
                                primarily anti-missile defense oriented, currently the weight of the
                                evidence suggests that two distinct programs are underway—a probable
                                    anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system around Moscow,
                                and a long-range surface-to-air interceptor missile system deployed
                                across the northwest approaches.</p>
                            <p>The components of the probable anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system around Moscow are a long-range
                                exo-atmospheric intercept missile, the “triad” electronic facilities
                                at several of the SA–1 complexes, the large phased array radar
                                southeast of Moscow orientated toward our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat corridor, and the dual early-warning

                        result of earlier Soviet assistance, their technical and industrial

                        could result in an initial operational capability in the early to mid-1970s.
                        If they did so, it is estimated that they would develop and deploy missiles

                    <p>The figures on population fatalities and industrial damage have been revised
                        on the basis of recent data. At the lower levels of attack, population
                        fatalities are somewhat higher and at all levels of attack, industrial
                        damage is lower than the figures used last year. The major change is in
                        industrial damage figures and results from a redefinition of Soviet
                        industrial capacity. Last year these figures were based on a combined index
                        of War Support Industries and Gross Industrial Product. Since Soviet War
                        Support Industries are very concentrated geographically, small numbers of
                        weapons showed large percentages of industrial damage; the new figures are
                        based on Gross Industrial Product only, a more consistent measure of overall
                        Soviet industrial capacity.</p>

                        warheads delivered do not appreciably change the results. In fact, when we

                    <p>It is clear, therefore, that our strategic missile forces alone would be
                        sufficient to inflict unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union, even after
                        absorbing a well-coordinated Soviet first strike against our strategic
                        offensive forces. Indeed, I believe that an ability to deliver and detonate
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] would furnish us with a completely adequate deterrent to
                        a deliberate Soviet nuclear attack on the United States or its Allies.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Thus,
                        the strategic missile forces recommended for the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967–71 period would provide an Assured Destruction
                        capability against both the Soviet Union and Communist China

                    <p>Given current expectations of cost, effectiveness, vulnerability to enemy
                        attack before or after launch, and simplicity and controllability of
                        operation, missiles are preferred as the primary weapon for the Assured
                        Destruction mission. Their ability to ride out even a heavy surprise nuclear
                        attack and still remain available for retaliation at times of our own
                        choosing weighs heavily in this preference. On the basis of the latest
                        intelligence, we are quite confident that the Soviets do not now have, and
                        cannot have in the near future, the ability to inflict high levels of
                        pre-launch attrition on our land-based missiles, or any attrition on our
                        submarine-based missiles at sea.</p>
                    <p>However, for purposes of analysis we have estimated the additional forces
                        which would be required if our missile forces turned out to be less reliable
                        and suffered greater pre-launch attrition than presently estimated. To
                        simplify the analysis we have taken a hypothetical case in which our missile
                        forces would be barely adequate for the Assured Destruction task, given the
                        expected missile effectiveness and allowing no missiles for other tasks. (In
                        fact, as I have indicated, our approved missile forces are much more than
                        barely adequate for this task and therefore already have built into them a
                        good measure of insurance.) The table below shows the cost of insuring
                        against various levels of unexpected missile degradation by buying either
                        additional missiles or bombers to attack the targets left uncovered as a
                        result of the assumed lowered missile effectiveness. Against the current
                        Soviet anti-bomber defenses we have measured the cost to hedge with B–52s
                        armed with gravity bombs since the FB–111/<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> would be a more expensive alternative. Conversely, against
                        an improved Soviet anti-bomber defense, the FB–111/<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> was used as providing a cheaper hedge than the B–52 armed
                        with either gravity bombs or <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>Only when missile effectiveness falls to less than about 50 percent of the
                        expected value are bombers more efficient than additional missiles for
                        insurance purposes. Against current Soviet defenses, the B–52 G and H force
                        is adequate to hedge against complete failure of the missile force for
                        Assured Destruction. Against possible future Soviet defenses, we must be
                        willing to believe that our missile effectiveness could turn out to be as
                        low as about 30 percent of our planning value before we would wish to insure
                        by bombers rather than by additional missiles.</p>
                    <p>Similar arguments could be developed with respect to greater than expected
                        Soviet ballistic missile defense effectiveness. There, too, it would be
                        necessary to assume very large and expensive Soviet ballistic missile
                        defense programs before bombers became a preferred form of insurance. (Later
                        in this memorandum I discuss the far less likely contingency where the
                        Soviets simultaneously deploy a force of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and a
                        sophisticated <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.)</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, for the Assured Destruction mission, manned bombers must be
                        considered in a supplementary role. In that role they can force the enemy to
                        provide defenses against aircraft in addition to defense against missiles.
                        This is particularly costly in the case of terminal defenses. The defender
                        must make his allocation of forces in ignorance of the attacker’s strategy,
                        and must provide in advance for defenses against both types of attack at
                        each of the targets. The attacker, however, <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0322"/>can postpone his decision until the time of the attack,
                        then strike some targets with missiles alone and others with bombers alone,
                        thereby forcing the defender, in effect, to “waste” a large part of his
                        resources. In this role, however, large bomber forces are not needed. A few
                        hundred aircraft can fulfill this function.</p>
                    <p>The present strategic bomber force consists of some 600 operational B–52s and
                        80 B–58s. Some 345 of the operational B–52s are the older C through F
                        models. Last year we had planned to keep these aircraft operational through
                        1972 by a program of life extension modifications and capability
                        improvements, at a cost of about $1.3 billion. To keep them operational
                        through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 would cost another $606
                        million for modifications, and even then we could not be certain about their
                        life expectancy. Thus, these older B–52s will eventually have to be phased
                        out of the force, leaving a total of 255 operational B–52Gs and Hs. These
                        later models of the B–52 can be maintained in a satisfactory operational
                        status at least through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975 and the
                        modifications necessary to ensure this have already been included in the
                        previously approved program.</p>
                    <p>Shown in the following table are the characteristics of three aircraft which
                        might serve as replacements for the B–52s, compared with the B–52C, the
                        B–52H and the B–58.</p>

                    <p>The FB–111A is a bomber version of the F–111 with the minimum changes
                        required to make it suitable for the strategic bombing role. The FB–111M–3
                        is a larger version of the F–111. It would have a longer fuselage, a maximum
                        takeoff gross weight of 130,000 lbs compared with 111,000 lbs for the
                        FB–111A and would carry a crew of 3 instead of 2. It would also have about a
                        10 percent greater combat range. The <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>
                        is <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0323"/>an entirely new and larger
                        aircraft which has yet to be developed. The characteristics and cost of the
                            <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> were discussed in considerable
                        detail in my memorandum on this subject last year.</p>
                    <p>The first operational FB–111s could be available in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 and the first FB–111M–3s about a year later. For a
                        force of 210 <gloss target="#t_UE1">U.E.</gloss> aircraft, the FB–111M–3
                        would cost about $800 million more than the FB–111As, including development
                        and production. The most significant operational factor in favor of the
                        FB–111M–3 over the FB–111A is the availability of space for a crew of 3
                        instead of 2. The larger crew could spread the heavy workload and reduce the
                        strain involved in strategic missions. The FB–111, however, would have
                        essentially the same performance as the fighter version and could be easily
                        used in that role. The FB–111M–3 would have less range with the same payload
                        in that role because of its greater weight, and could not operate as
                        efficiently from the shorter runways for which the F–111A was designed.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I fully support the first of these Air Force proposals. I believe, however,
                        that we can safely phase out the B–52 C–Fs on a somewhat faster schedule
                        than that proposed by the Air Force. I also propose to hold the FB–111A
                        configuration as close as possible to the fighter version so that it would,
                        indeed, be a dual purpose aircraft—strategic and tactical. The role of the
                        manned bomber in the strategic offensive mission, as we see the threat today
                        and over the next five years, simply does not warrant any large expenditure
                        on new manned bombers at this time.</p>
                    <p>To hedge against currently unforeseen requirements to replace the B–52 G and
                        H series with a manned aircraft capable of effective penetration against
                        possible advanced Soviet bomber defenses, system studies and advanced
                        development of subsystems suitable for an Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft
                            (<gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>) should continue. There does not
                        appear to be sufficient reason to start an engineering development program
                        for <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> now because of the high cost of
                        the system, and because the recommended bomber force offers adequate
                        insurance against the range of threats for which we have any current
                        evidence.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Air Force’s third proposal, no immediate decision to equip
                        the B–52s with <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> is needed until we have
                        a more substantial <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0324"/>indication of an
                        improvement in Soviet low altitude terminal defenses. However, the
                        capability to install <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>s on B–52s should
                        be developed.</p>
                    <p>Although not proposed by the Air Force, I also believe we should plan to
                        phase out the remaining B–58 medium bombers in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 when the build-up of the new FB–111 force is completed.
                        We now have 80 operational B–58s and this number would decline through
                        attrition to about 70 by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. Their
                        primary advantage resides in a supersonic dash capability. Once the FB–111
                        enters the force the uniqueness of this feature of the B–58s will be lost,
                        and their contribution to the strategic offensive forces will become
                        marginal.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the objective of forcing the enemy to split his defense resources
                        between two types of threats could be performed adequately by B–52 bomber
                        forces considerably smaller than those now programmed. However, introduction
                        of a dual-purpose FB–111 would provide added insurance at a relatively small
                        cost. A mixed force of B–52G–Hs together with some FB–111/<gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> now appears to be a reasonable choice
                        since the <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> with its low level standoff
                        capability and range of about 25 nautical miles can force the enemy to build
                        expensive terminal bomber defenses or be vulnerable to low altitude attack.
                        Even against very advanced terminal defenses the small size and low weight
                        of <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> would allow the U.S. to saturate or
                        exhaust the defenses with large numbers.</p>
                    <p>The cost of the manned bomber force I recommend compared to the cost of
                        continuing the current forces is shown in the table below:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The ultimate deterrent to a deliberate nuclear attack on the United States or
                        its Allies is our clear and mistakable ability to destroy the attacker as a
                        viable society. But if deterrence fails, either by accident or
                        miscalculation, it is essential that forces be available to limit the damage
                        of such an attack to ourselves or our Allies. Such forces include not only
                        anti-aircraft defenses, anti-ballistic missile defenses, anti-submarine
                        defenses, and civil defense, but also offensive forces, i.e., strategic
                        missiles and manned-bombers, used in a Damage Limiting role.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the Soviet Union, the potential utility of all Damage Limiting
                        efforts, including the use of our strategic offensive forces in that role,
                        is critically dependent on a number of uncertainties: <list>

                    <p>In order to illustrate some of the major issues involved in this problem, we
                        have tested a range of possible Damage Limiting programs against different
                        possible future Soviet threats. In practice, of course, uncertainty about
                        the direction in which the Soviet posture was developing would lead us to
                        maintain a flexible approach, matching the scope of our deployment of forces
                        to our evolving knowledge of the Soviet threat. Nevertheless, these cases
                        help to develop an appreciation of the possible future costs and benefits of
                        such programs.</p>

                    <p>Threat Ia is basically an extrapolation of the latest intelligence estimates,
                        reflecting some future growth in both offensive and defensive forces. Threat
                        III is a large Soviet response to our deployment of a ballistic <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0326"/>missile defense with much greater than
                        expected growth in both offensive and defensive forces. It includes a large
                        number of big, land-based missiles equipped with penetration aids designed
                        to overwhelm our defenses. Threat III also assumes that the Soviets respond
                        defensively to our Damage Limiting efforts with an extensive deployment of a
                        reasonably sophisticated <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system around

                    <p>In the first case, we assumed that the Soviets initiate nuclear war with a
                        simultaneous attack against our cities and military targets. In the second
                        case, we assume that the events leading up to the nuclear exchange develop
                        in such a way that the United States has no better alternative than to
                        strike first.</p>
                    <p>The ranges of fatalities estimated in the table reflect some of the possible
                        variations in Soviet targeting doctrine, technological sophistication,
                        possible errors in attack planning and in the degree of the disruption to
                        Soviet attack coordination. The higher end of the ranges of fatalities shown
                        for each case represents the full damage potential (a well-planned,
                        well-coordinated attack to maximize fatalities) under the given scenario.
                        The lower end of the ranges of estimates represents likely degradations in
                        execution and targeting, rather than lower bounds on the possible
                        effectiveness of Soviet weapon systems. All estimates assume that the
                        Soviets have missile penetration aids which are as sophisticated as our own
                        are expected to be in the same time period.</p>
                    <p>The first line on the table shows the Soviet damage potential against the
                        currently approved U.S. program in 1970. It illustrates the projected
                        performance of the currently approved bomber defenses, the Civil Defense
                        program and the strategic offensive forces. Without these programs, the
                        damage potential could be 160 million or more U.S. fatalities in a mixed
                        Soviet attack on military and civilian targets. A full Soviet attack
                        directed against our urban areas only would not increase this total by very
                        much.</p>
                    <p>As shown on the second line of the table, the situation is not substantially
                        changed by the assumed Soviet buildup (Threat Ia) between 1970 and 1975. A
                        Full Fallout Shelter Program, at a cost of about $3.6 billion would reduce
                        fatalities by about 15–20 million in all three cases. Damage Limiting
                        Posture A (cost—$28.1 billion) might reduce fatalities to somewhere between
                        80 and 90 million and Posture B (cost—$35.7 billion) to between 50 and 80
                        million in an early urban attack. But the benefits of these Damage Limiting
                        programs could be substantially offset, especially in the case of a Soviet
                        first strike, if the Soviets were to increase their offensive forces to the
                        levels assumed in Threat III.</p>
                    <p>Even larger Soviet responses than that of Threat III cannot be ruled out by
                        what we know of Soviet technology and resource constraints. Whether or how
                        the Soviets actually will respond depends on how strongly they desire a
                        reliable threat against the United States and on the alternative military
                        and non-military uses for the resources involved.</p>
                    <p>Our own uncertainty about how well our Damage Limiting forces would work is
                        likely to remain large. Some, but by no means all of the <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0329"/>uncertainties are reflected in the table on
                        page 18.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Reference is to the table entitled
                            “Costs of U.S. Damage Limiting Postures and Soviet Damage Potential,”
                            printed above.</note> It is difficult to quantify the operational
                        conditions of nuclear war. Degradations in our missile defense reliability
                        or in our offensive missile accuracy might have substantial effects. For
                        example, if our operational missile aiming error were 50 percent higher than
                        we assumed against Soviet hard missiles, the expected Soviet damage
                        potential after a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        instead of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]shown on the table. Even more important to the outcome
                        of a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] is the question of the speed and nature of Soviet
                        response. We estimate that the Soviets have the ability to place their
                        missiles on alert during a crisis, and, in the case of their hard missiles,
                        to keep them at 5 to 15 minute readiness for extended periods. Accordingly,
                        there is always the possibility that they might get warning of our attack
                        and launch at least their ready missiles at our cities before the impact of
                        our missile attack. In that case, U.S. fatalities, even if [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and
                        provided for Damage Limiting Posture B, would be [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>The costs of the various Damage Limiting programs would, of course, be spread
                        over a period of years. Even so, they would reach $5 to $6 billion per year
                        in the early 1970s. To maintain or improve the postures shown (against an
                        evolving Soviet threat) might involve continuing an annual expenditure of $3
                        to $5 billion.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of our analysis of the major Damage Limiting program
                        alternatives in relation to the Soviet nuclear threat, I have reached the
                        following conclusions:</p>

                        <item>Against likely Soviet postures for the 1970s, appropriate mixes of
                            Damage Limiting measures can effect substantial reductions in the
                            maximum damage the Soviets can inflict, but only at substantial
                            additional cost to the U.S. above the requirements for Assured
                            Destruction. Even so, against a massive and sophisticated Soviet attack
                            on civil targets, we cannot have high confidence of reducing fatalities

                            However, there are still many unresolved questions about the design and
                            performance of a system employing both exo-atmospheric and lower
                            altitude interceptors.</item>

                            responses to those efforts. Accordingly, we should not now commit
                            ourselves to a particular level of Damage Limiting against the Soviet
                            Union—first, because our deterrent makes general war unlikely, and
                            second, because assuring with high confidence against all reasonably
                            likely levels and types of attack is very costly, and even then,
                            uncertain. Our choices should be responsive to the observed development
                            of the Soviet threat and our evolving knowledge of the technical

                    <p>b. Damage Limitation Against an Nth Country Nuclear Threat</p>
                    <p>During the last year, the potential of an Nth country nuclear threat to the
                        United States has become more real and the feasibility of a defense against
                        it more promising. As pointed out earlier, the Chinese Communists have
                        detonated two nuclear devices and could develop and deploy a small force of
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in the mid to latter part of the
                        1970s. About seven other nations are economically and technologically
                        capable of producing nuclear weapons within the next ten years.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the threat of greatest concern to the United States is that posed
                        by the Chinese Communists. The development and deployment <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0331"/>of even a small force of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s might seem attractive to them as a token
                        but still highly visible threat to the U.S., designed to undermine our
                        military prestige and the credibility of any guarantee which we might offer
                        to friendly countries. An effective defense against such a force might not
                        only be able to negate that threat but might also prevent their use of
                        nuclear weapons for aggressive purposes and possibly discourage their
                        production and deployment of such weapons altogether.</p>
                    <p>Recent studies have convinced us that the development of an area <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense weapon is feasible and, indeed, we
                        have reprogrammed some $22 million of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965
                        funds to initiate this development. The area defense weapon, a long range
                        missile interceptor designated DM15X2, would, of course, be used in
                        combination with other components of the Nike X system. Furthermore, other
                        elements of a Damage Limiting posture might also be required—anti-bomber
                        defense, <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, civil defense.</p>
                    <p>In order to illustrate the problem of defense against an Nth country nuclear
                        threat, we have analyzed three Damage Limiting postures in relation to two
                        levels of threat in the mid-1970s. The major <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> components of these postures are shown below:</p>

                    <p>Posture A provides terminal <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense for

                        interceptors, but no area defense. Postures B and C both include an area
                        defense of the entire country, based primarily on TACMAR radars for long
                        range acquisition of targets, and area interceptors with high-yield warheads
                        for long-range X-ray kills of re-entry vehicles. Posture B also includes
                        terminal defense for 16 cities. Posture C provides terminal defense for 25
                        cities and a heavier area defense.</p>
                    <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0332"/>
                    <p>The effectiveness (and cost) of the defenses could be increased further by
                        strengthening them in any of a number of ways. Against attacks employing no
                        penetration aids, increasing the number of long range interceptor missiles
                        might be preferred. Against more sophisticated or larger attacks, the number
                        of Missile Site Radars might be increased from one to two at each point
                        defended with Sprint, the capabilities of the TACMAR radars might be
                        increased, or the number of cities with terminal defenses might be
                        increased.</p>
                    <p>Defense against Nth country aircraft involves area protection—insuring that
                        no enemy aircraft regardless of its target or direction of attack can be
                        sure of success. A minimum defense could be provided by situating our
                        current interceptor aircraft around the periphery of the country. The force
                        required for the peacetime air surveillance mission would provide a
                        relatively effective defense against small attacking bomber forces in the
                        northeast and north central sections. For other sections of the country
                        appropriate deployments of Airborne Early Warning and Control (<gloss target="#t_AEWC1">AEW&amp;C</gloss>) aircraft could reduce significantly
                        the probability of penetration. To achieve higher effectiveness, this
                        minimum area air defense could be supplemented, first by improved
                        surveillance capability—to insure against enemy aircraft approaching U.S.
                        airspace undetected, and secondly, by the introduction of more advanced
                        interceptors capable of intercepting attacking aircraft with higher
                        probability, and further from our borders.</p>
                    <p>Fallout shelters are designed primarily to protect against collateral fallout
                        from counter-military attacks, weapons aimed at other urban-industrial areas
                        or weapons deliberately exploded upwind of population targets in order to
                        avoid terminal defenses. The “area” defense described above might be very
                        effective in denying the last of these tactics, especially against small
                        attacks. The other two sources of fallout are also relatively much less
                        important in light attacks. This suggests that, against small
                        unsophisticated attacks, something less than a Full Fallout Shelter Program
                        may be appropriate in a light Damage Limiting posture.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> might be particularly important in
                        defending against Nth country threats. Submarine delivery of relatively
                        short range cruise or ballistic missiles may represent the earliest form of
                        a Chinese threat against the United States. Preliminary results indicate
                        that currently programmed <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces are
                        already adequate to handle any foreseeable Chinese threat. This problem is
                        addressed in a separate memorandum on <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Much more analysis of light defense postures is required before we are in a

                    <p>To illustrate the potentials of a “light” defense, we have examined the cost

                        high confidence defense against a light <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack, not just for a few selected cities, but for the

                    <p>The effectiveness of light Damage Limiting postures against future Soviet
                        threats has not yet been analyzed. It appears clear, however, that the
                        largest Soviet threats examined earlier in this memorandum could simply
                        exhaust the defense in a Soviet counter-urban first strike. Against smaller
                        Soviet postures, or Soviet attacks degraded in numbers or coordination by
                        prior U.S. counter-military attacks, offense penetration aids and tactics
                        might produce significant variations <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0334"/>in outcome. Penetration aids such as re-entry vehicles hardening and
                        exo-atmospheric chaff would have important effects for attack levels of
                        about 100 to 200 Soviet missiles.</p>
                    <p>The problem of designing light Damage Limiting postures is not yet well
                        understood. On the basis of information and analysis available at present I

                        Than Expected Soviet Threat in the 1970s</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of this memorandum I noted that we had given special
                        attention this year to an analysis of Soviet threats over and above those
                        projected in the latest National Intelligence Estimates, and that we have
                        done so because of certain recent U.S. technological developments which, if
                        duplicated by the Soviet Union, could have a major impact on our Assured
                        Destruction capability. I also stated that this capability is the vital
                        first objective which must be met in full by our strategic nuclear forces
                        under all foreseeable circumstances and regardless of the costs or
                        difficulties involved.</p>
                    <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0335"/>
                    <p>Perhaps the worst possible threat the Soviets could mount against our Assured
                        Destruction capability would be the simultaneous deployment of a force of
                        several hundred SS–9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s equipped with
                        highly accurate <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and a reasonably
                        sophisticated <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system equipped with
                        exo-atmospheric area defense missiles. Our <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> re-entry vehicle [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] is already well along in development
                        and we now propose to produce and deploy it in part of the Minuteman force.
                        We have also started development of an exo-atmospheric missile. We believe
                        the Soviets are developing an exo-atmospheric defense missile, but we have
                        no evidence that they are developing <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s.
                        In fact, we have no evidence that they have done much work on missile
                        penetration aids, which involve a technology which we believe would
                        logically precede the development of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s.
                        Past experience with Soviet developments of this type indicates an
                        intelligence lead time of three to four years. However, the lead time for
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s might be significantly
                        shorter.</p>
                    <p>Although we have no reason to believe at this time that the Soviets will
                        actually deploy a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force and an effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense during the next five to ten years,
                        the impact of such an action on our Assured Destruction capability would be
                        of such significance that we must carefully examine its implications and
                        take whatever measures may be necessary to hedge against that
                        possibility.</p>

                        can be translated into a requirement for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] of delivered U.S. payload. Whether
                        this requirement can be fulfilled by the programmed forces depends on the
                        scale and technology of Soviet offensive and defensive forces, and on Soviet
                        targeting doctrine. In the analysis which follows, it is assumed that the
                        Soviets use all but 100 of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        against our land-based missiles and that they use their remaining <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, their <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s, and their bombers against other military and civilian
                        targets. Reliabilities, yields, and <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>s of
                        Soviet weapons are assumed to have conservative (pessimistic for the U.S.)
                        values throughout. We have also assumed that the U.S. would have no missile
                        defense during the period under consideration.</p>

                    <p>In both 1966 and January 1970 the Soviets are assumed to execute high value
                        (and high risk) attacks against launch control facilities. Such tactics
                        maximize the expected Soviet kill of U.S. missiles. This factor has little
                        effect in 1966 when the Soviet SS–9 <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> is
                        estimated at 1.0 n.mi.; but in January 1970, with an SS–9 <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> of 0.5 n.mi., attacks on launch control
                        facilities have a major impact and account for the relatively low U.S.
                        surviving payload. By July 1972, all surviving Minuteman missiles could be
                        launched by the airborne launch control center and the Soviets therefore
                        would have to attack launch facilities.</p>
                    <p>In view of this apparent sensitivity to the availability of an airborne
                        launch control center, an analysis was done for July 1968 assuming no
                        airborne launch control center. Under these conditions, surviving land-based
                        payload was reduced to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>]. With the Polaris contribution, this is still
                        more than enough for the Assured Destruction task. The Soviet attack in this
                        situation was concentrated on the Minuteman launch control centers and
                        accounted for disablement of over 500 Minuteman missiles. This emphasizes
                        the importance of timely development of the airborne launch control center.
                        Funding for both development and procurement of this system has been
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the table above shows that the Soviets cannot undermine our
                        Assured Destruction capability without <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s or <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> or unless they build
                        many more missiles than the high range of the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>The table shows that if the Soviets do achieve a <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> of 1200 feet with their <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, a force of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source

                        forces. The extreme sensitivity of these calculations to <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> is illustrated by the fact that a force of

                    <p>In summary, a Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> deployment could

                    <p>This case illustrates the effect of a hypothetical—very strong and very
                        early—but possible Soviet threat. The assumed Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> forces reflect the maximum feasible
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> capability. Although the assumed
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense does not include terminal
                        defenses, its effectiveness is overestimated since U.S. payloads are based
                        on the currently programmed forces and U.S. tactics used in these
                        calculations have not been optimized in the light of that defense. For
                        example, if our attack were to be concentrated only on a part of the Soviet
                        urban target system, the results would be much better for the U.S.</p>
                    <p>But, as I noted earlier, the simultaneous deployment by the Soviet Union of
                        both a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force and an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense
                        would require major changes in U.S. strategic offensive forces since the
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s would degrade the effectiveness
                        of our land-based missiles to a point where the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense would become effective against the residual
                        strategic forces, i.e., the sea-based Polaris. Although we do not now
                        believe that the Soviets could achieve such a combined <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        capability in the time schedule shown in the table above, or that they would
                        be willing to incur the very high costs of such a program, it does lie
                        within their technical capabilities in the decade of the 1970s. Accordingly,
                        we should now take whatever steps are needed to place ourselves in a
                        position to counter this threat if it should develop.</p>

                        supplement our presently planned strategic offensive forces, if this should
                        become necessary. The first is to proliferate hard, fixed-base missiles
                        (such as Minuteman) with relatively low cost per unit of alert payload in
                        inventory, but high cost per unit of payload surviving a Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed, low-<gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> attack. The second
                        includes sea and land based mobile systems, and “super hardened” and “hard
                        defended” fixed missile sites, which have relatively high costs per unit of
                        alert payload in inventory and are relatively insensitive to the Soviet
                        offensive threat. The characteristics of four of these alternatives are

                    <p>The costs of Polaris submarines and of Minuteman facilities have already been
                        incurred and hence are not included. The Poseidon and <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss> figures include development costs. The
                            <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss> costs are for a force of 600
                        missiles, while the Poseidon costs are based on retrofitting all 41 of the
                        Polaris submarines. The Polaris and Poseidon costs are based on the 56
                        percent of the Polaris force which we plan to have on station at all
                        times.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets do not develop <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and
                        choose to emphasize <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense, or if they
                        achieve a major breakthrough in their <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        capability, fixed-base missiles are generally preferred to mobile missiles.
                        The Air Force is now studying the development of follow-on, land-based
                        missiles of considerably increased size and payload which could be available
                        in the time period with which we are concerned. One such missile, the
                        above-mentioned <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss>, could be retrofitted to
                        existing Minuteman silos or be deployed in new, harder [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] silos. Even
                        against the <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> threat, <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss> might become attractive if it could be
                        effectively defended at a sufficiently low cost.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. response to a Soviet deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense unaccompanied by a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force would be the
                        incorporation of appropriate penetration aids on our strategic missiles.
                        Against area defense interceptors, chaff cloud penetration aids can be
                        provided for U.S. missiles (so that an Assured Destruction capability is
                        maintained) at a cost to us of less than 10 percent of the cost of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense to the Soviets. The lead time for
                        the Soviets to mount an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense is
                        greater than the time for us to produce and deploy penetration aids,
                        provided we take timely action to develop them. A capability for employing
                        terminal penetration aids is already being incorporated in our strategic
                        missile forces. We now propose to develop area penetration aids for the
                        Polaris A–3, the Minuteman and the Titan missiles, and improved terminal
                        penetration aids for Minuteman III which will use the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. A decision
                        actually to deploy these new penetration aids is not required now. If the
                        Soviets do attempt a large <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense we
                        will still be able to make appropriately timed decisions to produce and
                        deploy the necessary penetration aids before the Soviets could achieve an
                        extensive deployment.</p>
                    <p>Against a combined Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> threat, it is clear from the above table
                        that the most efficient of the alternatives available to us would be to
                        develop Poseidon and retrofit it into Polaris boats. The timing of the
                        development and of the decision to produce and deploy would depend upon how
                        this threat actually evolved. To bring out this problem in its starkest
                        form, we have assumed for the analysis which follows the same Soviet threat
                        used previously in the “Extreme Case”. The numbers of additional surviving,
                        reliable Poseidon missiles needed to guarantee our Assured Destruction

                    <p>The last block of this table shows the number of survivable, reliable
                        Poseidon missiles which could be added to the force, time-phased for three
                        different initial “operational availability dates (<gloss target="#t_OAD1">OAD</gloss>)”. In each case, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] would be retrofitted with Poseidons;
                        to retrofit the remaining 10 boats would be too expensive and other
                        alternatives such as the construction of new boats might be more attractive.
                        Considering the fact that we are dealing here with an extremely high and
                        very unlikely threat, I believe that an initial <gloss target="#t_OAD1">OAD</gloss> date of 1970 would provide us an ample margin of safety.
                        Last year I recommended the initiation of the Poseidon development but
                        without any fixed schedule. In the light of the foregoing analysis, I now
                        recommend that its development schedule be tied to an <gloss target="#t_OAD1">OAD</gloss> date of 1970.</p>

                        more reliance on such a force. At present, the primary communication system
                        for Polaris submarines in the Atlantic consists of two <gloss target="#t_VLF1">VLF</gloss> transmitters and a number of repeaters
                        dependent on them. These transmitters are extremely vulnerable, as is the
                        command post at Norfolk, Virginia from which they are keyed. Emergency
                        communications facilities are also soft, consisting primarily of <gloss target="#t_HF1">HF</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_LF1">LF</gloss>
                        transmitters. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        communications system, and a decision now to develop any one of them on a
                        crash basis would be premature. Because of its importance to an Assured
                        Destruction capability which depends heavily on a sea-based missile force,
                        this study effort must and will continue to receive a very high
                        priority.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Air Force now agrees that a 1971 force of 1,000 Minuteman is adequate in
                        context with the total U.S. strategic offensive forces now programmed and in
                        the light of the expected (i.e., the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>)
                        threat. However, the Air Force also recommends the development of an
                        Improved Capability Missile (<gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss>) for
                        deployment in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973–74 time period as a
                        replacement for some of the Minuteman. As brought out in the foregoing
                        analysis, the <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss> must be considered in
                        conjunction with the Poseidon and in relation to the higher-than-expected
                        Soviet threat. Accordingly the principal issue concerning the Minuteman
                        force at this time is the production and deployment of new re-entry
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>Last year it was decided to replace, eventually, all of the Minuteman I with
                        the Minuteman II, which has much greater accuracy, payload, and versatility.
                        Minuteman II, for example, promises a single shot kill probability against a
                            [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In
                        addition, its greater re-targeting capability reduces the number of missiles
                        that need to be programmed to achieve one reliably delivered warhead.
                        Finally, its booster is compatible with <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>. For these reasons I recommend that all the Minuteman I’s
                        be replaced by end <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972.</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of the Minuteman force can be further improved by the
                        production and deployment of two new re-entry systems which we now have
                        under development. One of these, the Mk 17, promises a kill probability
                        against [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                    <p>All of our analysis indicates that a Civil Defense effort of at least the
                        magnitude of our currently approved program ($150–200 million per year)
                        would be an efficient component of any Damage Limiting program. However, we
                        are still uncertain how many useful shelter spaces <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>the present program will provide. We
                        currently estimate the deficit at 74 million spaces by 1970, although the
                        number could be much larger. If we were to eliminate this deficit,
                        principally by providing dual-purpose shelter space in new construction, the
                        total cost to the Government of a nation-wide fallout shelter program would
                        be about $3.7 billion. Every increase of 10 percent above the estimated
                        deficit could add $200–500 million to the cost of that program.</p>
                    <p>In any event, shelter construction lead time is shorter than that for the
                        other components of a major Damage Limiting program. When and if we decide
                        to deploy such a program, sufficient time will be available to provide any
                        additional fallout shelters needed. Moreover, the prospect of an area
                        missile defense for the entire country has reopened the question of the
                        relationship between passive and active defense. If we were to decide to
                        orient our Damage Limiting efforts primarily to the Nth country threat, it
                        would appear that a large expansion of the Civil Defense Program would not

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) As indicated in reference 1b, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff have, in connection with their review of <gloss target="#t_DEPEX1">DEPEX</gloss>, considered the Army <gloss target="#t_PCP1">PCP</gloss> A–5–026 which requests the necessary
                            resources to initiate the production and deployment planning required to
                            meet the desired Nike-X initial operational capability (<gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>) date of October 1970. Inasmuch as
                            these are inseparable elements of the deployment consideration, comments
                            submitted herein are consolidated.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe
                            that the requirement for an effective ballistic missile defense is a
                            very real and urgent one. The existing and growing Soviet ballistic
                            missile capability, the increasing probability of a Soviet ballistic
                            missile defense deployment, plus the potential Chinese People’s Republic
                                (<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>) threat, all emphasize the
                            necessity for proceeding with a US ballistic missile defense at the <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0349"/>earliest practicable date. The
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the phased deployment concept for
                            Nike-X, presented in <gloss target="#t_DEPEX1">DEPEX</gloss>, represents
                            a logical approach toward the attainment of the necessary capability. It
                            would provide an initial defense against the over-all ballistic missile
                            threat, permit controlled growth within fairly level budgetary
                            expenditures, while providing the necessary decision latitude required
                            for a program of this magnitude.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>(C) The requirement for a balanced assured destruction and
                            damage-limiting capability against the total threat remains valid and is
                            a strong factor in any recommendation to undertake deployment of a
                            ballistic missile defense. The deployment phasing proposed in <gloss target="#t_DEPEX1">DEPEX</gloss> will permit parallel effort in
                            other complementary systems to achieve the required balance in assured
                            destruction and damage-limiting elements.</item>

                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other Department of Defense agencies as
                            decision points are reached for Nike-X deployment. The Joint Chiefs of

                                    view that <gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss> has placed undue

                                    ballistic missile defense upon incomplete military and political
                                    considerations that go beyond the scope of scientific appraisal
                                    of the Nike-X system. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                                    our strategic defense posture in regard to the Soviet threat
                                    could be placed in jeopardy by delay in the <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of the Nike-X system. This is a

                                <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff are convinced that the US national

                                    counter all aspects of the threat. It was for this reason that
                                    the Army’s <gloss target="#t_DEPEX1">DEPEX</gloss> study
                                    recommended employment of other defensive measures as well as

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>
                    <p>I have reviewed the draft memoranda on the Five Year Force Structure for
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67–71 which you forwarded to me on
                        October 28.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">Reference is to a set of draft
                            memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> prepared during

                            1965.</note> As in past years, I am immensely impressed at the very high
                        caliber of your analyses. I find these memoranda extremely useful in
                        obtaining a better understanding of the current status of our force posture
                        and likely future problems. In this connection, I would like to note that
                        your staff, in particular <persName corresp="#p_EAC1">Alain
                            Enthoven</persName> and his people, have been most cooperative in
                        providing us with an appreciation of the emerging problem areas.</p>
                    <p>I would like to comment on several issues which I believe to have major
                        significance for our national security policy. The first deals with our
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">This issue was covered mainly in <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s October 13 draft memorandum
                            to the President on “<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the
                            United States Five-Year Force Structure and Financial Program.”
                            (Ibid.)</note> You and I continue to be in agreement that the position
                        which the US has evolved over the past several years concerning the
                        importance of a realistic non-nuclear capability in Europe remains an
                        important tenet of US policy. In this connection, the further work which you
                        are now having done within the Department of Defense to define more
                        precisely both the requirements for and the capabilities of a non-nuclear
                        military effort in Europe will undoubtedly prove useful. But the problem to
                        which I believe we must both address ourselves is the priority of effort
                        which we wish to apply to a series of policy issues which currently confront
                        us within the alliance.</p>
                    <p>I know you are fully aware of the numerous problems which currently bear on
                        our European relations. First and foremost among these are the
                        German/nuclear sharing issue and the future role of France within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Clearly these matters are so important
                        that they should take first priority in our diplomatic relations with
                        Europe. While giving primary attention to the solution of these problems, I
                        agree we should <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0352"/>continue to pursue
                        other important objectives, including those relating to what the US
                        considers to be an appropriate strategy and force posture for the
                        alliance.</p>
                    <p>However, we are not likely to persuade our allies fully to adopt our
                        judgments on force posture, at least in the short run. It could be seriously
                        counterproductive if we were to press our views with regard to emphasis on a
                        major non-nuclear option to the point that it further complicated our
                        political problems. While I personally cannot accept the point of view,
                        there would be those in Europe who would question our resolve to defend
                        Europe in the event of Communist attack if they interpreted our emphasis on
                        a non-nuclear buildup as reducing the importance we attach to a nuclear
                        deterrent.</p>
                    <p>I note that you feel that there may be some inconsistency in our retaining
                        the current US military posture in Europe (or in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>-based support) if we cannot bring our allies to a full
                        acceptance of our views on strategy with resultant major improvements to
                        their own non-nuclear force posture. Despite the limited sympathy of the
                        Europeans with our strategic views, we have managed to induce our allies to
                        develop forces which do contain a capability for a considerable non-nuclear
                        effort. This, together with our present nuclear options, represents a strong
                        deterrent, and a significant war-fighting capability. While I agree that we
                        should work toward elimination of inadequacies in our allies’ force
                        postures, it seems to me that we are going to have to accept some imbalances
                        for the time being. Thus, I do not see that the threat to reduce, even less
                        so, the actual withdrawal of a portion of US forces from Europe, as is
                        touched upon in one of our memoranda, would serve our policy interests
                        during the next several months while we pursue the German/nuclear sharing
                        problem and the problems which will undoubtedly arise out of the evolving
                        issue with regard to France’s role in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>I personally hope that full discussion of the nuclear problem in connection
                        with the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear force issue will
                        serve to close the gap between us and our allies on strategy, particularly
                        as the European leaders come to understand fully the issues involved in the
                        use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>There are other related matters which bear on our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policy which are treated in your memoranda and on which I
                        might briefly comment: <list>

                            <item>With regard to the constraints on a further tactical nuclear
                                weapons buildup, I agree that the general guidelines established by
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 334<note n="4" xml:id="d105fn4">
                                    <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> should be
                                maintained. However, I would hope that we <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0353"/>could have some additional
                                clarification concerning the relationship to <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 334 levels of certain specific
                                proposals, such as the ADM and 155 Howitzer programs, and any others
                                you may see arising in the early future. My staff will be following
                                up on these problems.</item>
                            <label>b.</label>
                            <item>If the question of land-based <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>’s is again surfaced in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, it will be necessary for us to work out carefully
                                the tactics for handling this matter with our allies. I gather you
                                feel that the military case for such weapons is not persuasive. For
                                our part, we see some political problems which would result from a
                                land-based deployment of such weapons, though we have not recently
                                reviewed our position on this matter. This is clearly an issue which
                                requires continuing close contact between State and Defense. The
                                outcome of current discussions on the ANF/<gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss> problem will have a bearing on this.</item>
                            <label>c.</label>
                            <item>I agree in principle on the desirability of shifting the <gloss target="#t_QRA1">QRA</gloss> role from aircraft to Pershings, as
                                Pershings demonstrate the necessary capability, but anticipate this
                                may raise certain political problems. At such time as you are
                                prepared to make a specific proposal with regard to this shift, I
                                would appreciate an opportunity to review it and to work out with
                                you the precise tactics for presenting the proposal to our
                                allies.</item>

                            <item>Your proposed command and control study seems to me to have very
                                considerable merit. This question has generated so much interest
                                among allied governments in the past, that any US study of this
                                issue can be expected to arouse considerable attention in the
                                future. Accordingly, I suggest that our staffs work out very
                                carefully the terms of reference and the method for proceeding with
                                this study, and upon its completion that we consider together its
                                political implications before it is presented to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</item>

                    <p>As a matter which bears upon our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> policy
                        but obviously has broader implications as well, I have been impressed by the
                        increasing reliance which our strategy places on the ability to deploy US
                        forces to various trouble spots around the world. I appreciated the degree
                        to which your efforts have been directed toward improving the ability of the
                        US to project its military power where it is required and to do so in ways
                        designed to support our foreign policy. In the face of growing demands on US
                        forces, I feel it is important that we stay abreast of the status of our
                        deployment capabilities and accordingly, I have asked <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> to keep in touch with your
                        staff on this matter.</p>

                        limiting programs and especially the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. I
                        want to make clear that I do not believe that foreign policy problems should
                        in any way prevent us from deploying a system that could contribute
                        significantly to the defense of the US at such time as you believe such a
                        program is feasible and necessary. Nevertheless, there will be certain
                        political problems that will have to be dealt with if a decision is made to
                            <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0354"/>deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. As you know, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> already has asked to discuss the political implications of
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment with us, and other
                        countries have shown some interest. I would like to see us take advantage of
                        the additional time afforded by the deferral of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment to discuss the political aspects of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program as it affects our allies. This will
                        require additional studies both by State and Defense, and the joint
                        development of a course of action. I propose that we address ourselves to
                        that task without delay. I am, therefore, suggesting that <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> get in touch with appropriate
                        people in Defense on this matter at an early date.</p>
                    <p>There are several other issues which I can only briefly touch upon in this
                        letter, but I believe you and I should set aside time to discuss them at
                        greater length, and I would hope in the fairly near future: <list>

                                <p>While we need to do some very hard thinking about how the
                                    military assistance program can be improved, the foreign policy
                                    significance of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is such that
                                    I would not want to proceed on the assumption that major
                                    adjustments in rationale, scope or content of that program can
                                    be made until such changes are thoroughly and carefully
                                    examined.</p>
                                <p>For example, in your draft memorandum to the President on this
                                    subject, certain conclusions are advanced about the ability to
                                    reduce reliance upon indigenous forces and the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for such forces on the
                                    assumption of a changing threat and the further assumption that
                                    the growing US capability can to a degree substitute for
                                    indigenous forces. This issue requires very careful examination.
                                    The extent to which we wish to assume such responsibility, even
                                    provided the governments in question were prepared to accept
                                    such a change, is by no means a clear or easy issue to decide.
                                    Moreover, in view of the more immediate problems which appear to
                                    confront us in connection with meeting our overseas obligations
                                    (a point which I have alluded to above), it is not entirely
                                    clear to me whether or when we can assume such increased
                                    responsibilities.</p>
                                <p>A second major question concerns the relationship between the
                                    military aid which should be provided Pakistan and that for
                                    India. While I fully agree that the relationship between these
                                    two countries must be carefully scrutinized before we decide
                                    upon the content and levels of future military aid, I feel we
                                    cannot settle this question at the present time. This
                                    illustrates what to me is a very troublesome question about
                                        <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, namely to what extent
                                    do we take any part in military efforts which might encourage
                                    other nations to engage in local arms races or to use violence
                                    in neighborhood quarrels. Until such broad issues are resolved
                                    we should leave open the specific <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> allocations to India and Pakistan.</p>

                                    assistance program so that they might formulate proposals for

                            <item>I noted last year my interest in having a further exposition of
                                the tactical nuclear problem as it affects theaters other than
                                Europe. Particularly with our growing commitment in the Far East, it
                                seems to me that we need a great deal more insight into the utility
                                of and limitations on the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons
                                in that theater. While your memorandum to the President on tactical
                                nuclear weapons this year alludes briefly to this problem, I am
                                convinced that a great deal more work needs to be done. Since the
                                questions of tactical nuclear weapons so intimately relates
                                political and military considerations, I believe this is an effort
                                which might jointly be undertaken by State and Defense. I would
                                welcome your views on this entire problem.</item>

                    <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                    <p>To estimate the capabilities and limitations of Soviet strategic air and
                        missile defense forces through mid-1967, and general trends in these forces
                        through 1975.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <p>A. Confronted by powerful Western strategic attack forces, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is sustaining its vigorous effort to
                        strengthen its defenses. We believe that the Soviets are responding to those
                        challenges to their security that they can now see or foresee from aircraft,
                        ballistic missiles, and earth satellites. (Paras. l-5)</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">Air Defenses</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>B. The Soviets have achieved a formidable capability against aircraft
                        attacking at medium and high altitudes, but their air defense system
                        probably is still susceptible to penetration by stand-off weapons and
                        low-altitude tactics. The Soviets probably foresee little reduction in the
                        bomber threat over the next ten years. To meet this challenge, they are
                        improving their warning and control systems and are changing the character
                        of their interceptor force through the introduction of new high-performance,
                        all-weather aircraft. In addition, there are recent indications that the
                        Soviets are now employing light AAA in some areas for low-altitude defense.
                        (Paras. 3, 4, 8–19)</p>
                    <p>C. The Soviets probably will continue to improve and to rely on the SA–2 as
                        the principal <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system. We believe that
                        they will develop an improved or new <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                        system for low altitude defense; such a system would probably be deployed
                        more extensively than the SA–3. Deployment of a long-range <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system probably is now underway in the
                        northwestern <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and probably will be

                            specific mission of the new defensive systems being deployed in
                            northwest <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They acknowledge that
                            available evidence does support a conclusion that the sites in the
                            northwest may be intended for defense against the aerodynamic threat.
                            However, on balance, considering all the evidence, they believe it is
                            more likely that the systems being deployed at these sites are primarily
                            for defense against ballistic missiles. [Footnote in the source

                    <p>D. For nearly ten years, the Soviets have given high priority to research and
                        development of antimissile defenses. We estimate that they have now begun to
                        deploy such defenses at Moscow. These defenses could probably achieve some
                        capability as early as 1967, but we think a more likely date for an initial
                        operational capability is 1968. We do not yet know the performance
                        characteristics of this system, or how it will function. (Paras. 27–34)</p>
                    <p>E. The Soviets will almost certainly continue with their extensive effort to
                        develop ballistic missile defenses to counter the increasingly sophisticated
                        threat that will be posed by US strategic missile forces. We cannot now
                        estimate with confidence the scale or timing of future Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. We believe, however, that the
                        Soviets will deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses for major
                        urban-industrial areas. By 1975, they could deploy defenses for some 20 to
                        30 areas containing a quarter of the Soviet population and more than half of
                        Soviet industry. (Paras. 36–37)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>F. The Soviets could already have developed a limited antisatellite
                        capability based on an operational missile with a nuclear warhead and
                        existing electronic capabilities. We have no evidence that they have done
                        so. In any event, we believe that the Soviets would prefer to have a system
                        which could track foreign satellites more accurately and permit the use of
                        non-nuclear kill mechanisms. We estimate that the Soviets will have an
                        operational capability with such a system within the next few years. We
                        believe, however, that the Soviets would attack a US satellite in peacetime
                            <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0358"/>only if, along with a strong
                        desire for secrecy, they were willing for other reasons to greatly disrupt
                        East-West relations.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">Mr. <persName>Thomas L.
                                Hughes</persName>, the Director of Intelligence and Research,
                            Department of State, believes that the Soviets would conclude that the
                            adverse consequences of destroying or damaging US satellites in
                            peacetime would outweigh the advantage of such an action. He therefore
                            believes it highly unlikely that they would attack US satellites in

                    <p>The estimates are essentially the same as those contained in the most recent

                        estimate in the attached that, in mid-1966, there will be about 315
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers (of which 90
                        will be of the new single-silo type) lies at the bottom of the range of
                        310–364 (of which 90–140 would be new single-silo type), as estimated for
                        mid-1966 in the ′65–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>. The estimate in the
                        attached of 440 launchers in mid-1967 is about in the middle of the range of
                        420–476 launchers estimated for that time in the ′65–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The estimates in the ′65–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> were up somewhat
                        from the ′64–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">
                            <ref target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> which estimated that in

                        change in the ′65–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> reflected the firm
                        information on the introduction by the Soviets of complexes of single-silo
                        launchers which one might compare with our own Minuteman system. The numbers
                        in the attached, however, are within the range predicted in the ′64–<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> for mid-1966 and only 10 percent higher
                        than the range predicted for mid-1967.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet build-up does of course make the option of a disarming preemptive
                        strike less and less plausible. However, this has been recognized in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> planning for a couple of years. As you know
                        from the most recent <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> budget exercise,
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> planning has now passed far beyond
                        numbers like these. We are now worrying about much more massive missile
                        deployments coupled with possible Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (multiple independent reentry vehicles) and the extensive
                        deployment of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>

                        included funds for further research on the specific size, operations, and
                        functions and for its construction in the Army’s portion of the military
                        construction authorization bills in early 1964. Aware of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff’s reservations and believing the issues were too complex and
                        sensitive, the House Armed Services Committee did not approve funds for the
                        Deep Underground Command Center but instead created a special subcommittee
                        to study the issue thoroughly. (Memorandum from Deputy Director of Defense

                        not include funds for construction or research for this facility, and the
                        chairmen of key Congressional committees also rejected the Department of
                        Defense proposal to use other authorized funds for feasibility studies.

                    <p>The Department of Defense deferred action temporarily (letter from <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> to Vinson, October 9; ibid.) but
                        continued to study the cost and configuration of the proposed facility. In
                        early 1965, for instance, the Office of the Director of Defense Research and
                        Engineering made tentative recommendations for possible sites. (Memorandum

                    <p>In its response, the Department of Defense informed the House Committee that
                        it proposed, among other things, to dig one shaft to “advance both the
                        design and construction time and permit research and development efforts
                        associated with the rock properties at the site to proceed concurrently.
                        This would permit us to obtain early verification of our current estimates
                        of subsurface rock conditions (based on preliminary test drillings) which
                        have a direct bearing upon the cost and technical problems associated with
                        the major construction of entrance and exit tunnels and the main underground
                        facility.” (Letter from Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and

                        ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the Department of Defense’s interest in the project gradually
                        waned. When, for example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed to obtain,
                        among other things, the President’s views “as to the nonmilitary functional
                        and personnel requirements of those departments and agencies of the National
                        Government” to be provided for in the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss>,
                        they were much later informed that no response would be made to their
                        proposal. (<gloss target="#t_JCSM1">JCSM</gloss>–985–64 to Secretary

                    <p>Moreover, Congress authorized only $4 million for this project in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966, and letters from four Committee

                        expressed “doubt that we should proceed to spend $4 million until after
                        Congress acts on ′67” (handwritten note to Ignatius, February 18, on
                        Anthony’s February 16 memorandum), and he shortly decided not to seek
                        Congressional clearance for continued planning for the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> project and agreed to divert the Army
                        specialists engaged on the <gloss target="#t_DUCC1">DUCC</gloss> to other

                    <p>In my draft memorandum for the President on Strategic Offensive and Defensive
                        Nuclear Forces, dated October 16, 1965,<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">Not
                            found; for text of the November 1, 1965, draft memorandum, see <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note> the planning figures of
                        700 Minuteman II and 300 Minuteman III were used. These figures were based
                        on an extrapolation to 1970 of the present Soviet target system and the
                        present philosophy that underlies the US Single Integrated Operations Plan
                            (<gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>). The calculations that lead to
                        these figures take proper account of other programmed U.S. strategic forces
                        in the same time period, e.g., the Polaris force. However, no account has
                        yet been taken in these calculations of the implications of possible Soviet
                        anti-ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) defenses.</p>

                                and hence how may Mk 12 and MK 17 re-entry vehicles should be
                                procured for use on Minuteman missiles?</item>

                                be distributed through the Minuteman III force, against various

                    </p>
                    <p>Clearly, these are complex questions. Overall U.S missile force postures will
                        depend on the types of Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s we
                        assume. The distribution of Minuteman II/Minuteman III will depend on the
                        Polaris/Poseidon mix, and will be affected by possible development and
                        eventual deployment of a small re-entry vehicle of the Mk 100 type for
                        Minuteman. Perhaps most importantly, the desirable mix of Minuteman
                        II/Minuteman III will depend on the strategic objectives we assign to the
                        U.S. offensive forces, as reflected in the type of <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> assumed to govern the use of these forces in the time
                        periods and environments of interest.</p>
                    <p>In addition to providing very important source material for rather near-term
                        Minuteman force posture decisions, I expect that a study of these questions
                        would be of significant aid in a number of other areas: <list>

                    <p>I should like you to perform such a study in stages. The first stage will be
                        to consider the types of <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>, and hence
                        the type of <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> guidance, that might seem
                        appropriate for the employment of U.S. missile forces against a Soviet
                        target list protected by <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. To be
                        specific, I suggest you consider <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss>
                        guidance for the programmed U.S. forces at end <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971, against National Intelligence Estimates of Soviet

                                deployed at the 25 largest Soviet cities in rough proportion to

                                threat and in the face of a specific Soviet attack. The programmed
                                force would be operated under the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> guidance resulting from Stage I of the

                    </p>
                    <p>After my review of the results of the first two stages, I would like to
                        specify a small number of alternative combinations of U.S. force postures,
                        Soviet offensive threats and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s, and
                        scenarios. For each such combination, an evaluation of both the
                        Damage-Limiting capability and of the Assured-Destruction capability of each
                        U.S. posture will be requested.</p>
                    <p>I would like to receive the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> guidance
                        requested above, together with the rationale behind it, by February 15,
                        1966. This discussion may assume a good knowledge of the present <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> on the part of my staff. It should
                        discuss how a <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> in the face of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> would differ from our present plan. It can
                        be in outline form, but it should be complete enough to allow a simulated
                        laydown of arbitrary mixes of the U.S. strategic weapons available in 1971,
                        against a Soviet target list of the size and structure that might be
                        predicted for that time on the basis of National Intelligence Estimates. For
                        this purpose, details of the assumed Soviet SBM are not highly relevant.
                        Much more important are questions of targeting philosophy, such as, for
                        instance, the desirability of attacking <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        radars as part of a counter-military task, and the desirability of choosing
                        urban-industrial targets on a rank-order basis, instead of on a basis of
                        maximum total fatalities.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear <persName>John</persName>:</p>
                    <p>The Secretary has concluded that we should give consideration to offering the
                        Russians a reciprocal exchange of information on our <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0368"/>respective procedures for insuring control
                        of nuclear weapons. Although it is obvious that propaganda underlies the
                        clamor recently raised by the Soviets alleging inadequacies of American
                        control over nuclear weapons stockpiled with Allied forces, it is possible
                        that the top Soviet leaders are not fully aware of the extensiveness and
                        effectiveness of these controls. We doubt that the Russians would agree to
                        such an exchange of information, but the very fact of such an offer on our
                        part would provide us with a counter to their propaganda charges of alleged
                        neglect toward nuclear control. They would also be aware that unwillingness
                        to discuss their own procedures would increase their vulnerability on this
                        propaganda front. Finally, raising the idea of such an exchange might also
                        cause the top leaders to familiarize themselves more thoroughly with our
                        procedures, and might even lead them to review and to tighten their own
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>We therefore believe that we should consider making such an offer, in terms
                        which would put on record a reaffirmation of the seriousness with which we
                        regard the problem and a refutation of their erroneous statements regarding
                        our controls. In case of Soviet acceptance of the offer, we believe it
                        should be possible to provide information—without disclosing data which must
                        be kept secret—which will strengthen our case, we may elicit some useful
                        information from the Soviet Union, and we would have opened a dialogue in an
                        area of important mutual concern. We believe it would be possible to engage
                        in such an exchange without getting into questions about aspects of our
                        custodial control procedures which might be unconvincing to the Russians; it
                        is clear that they will not be so forthcoming with respect to their own
                        arrangements, if, indeed, they will discuss them at all—as to place us in
                        the position of being more reticent than they. If they do not agree to a
                        reciprocal exchange of information, as is likely, we can still provide them
                        information on our control procedures if we wish.</p>
                    <p>While the Soviets have placed the main emphasis in their propaganda on our
                        nuclear weapons stockpiled with and for the use of Allied forces, we believe
                        it would be preferable to focus our comments on the general subject of
                        insuring Presidential control, so as not to accentuate questions of trust
                        with respect to Allies. (This would, incidentally, also blunt Soviet
                        suspicion that we were only attempting to smoke out questions of Warsaw Pact
                        nuclear supporting arrangements.)</p>
                    <p>Enclosed are a draft note proposing such an exchange; and an illustrative
                        draft of a statement<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Neither printed.</note>
                        setting forth some information on our control arrangements, which could be

                        would of course want to inform such Allies as Germany and the United Kingdom

                        is a classic case in that it raises all of the key issues in the area of

                    <p>Since the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        are less critical in this context. But the release of this Agreement with
                        its comprehensive list of issues might open up a great debate over the
                        President’s emergency powers.</p>

                    <p>As you are aware, [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not

                    <p>I conclude that the President and <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss>
                        must themselves serve as the reviewing authority for Presidential nuclear

                        security will not permit any further checks and balances.<note n="6" xml:id="d114fn6">The postscript is handwritten.</note>

                    <p>Attached is a copy of the minutes of our Strategy Discussion Group Meeting
                        last Tuesday. I thought that this was a very useful discussion as it enabled
                        us to get on the table some of the issues that have been concerning all of
                        us with respect to the future direction of the Special Committee.</p>
                    <p>I was particularly struck by the fact that we face a very real dilemma as we
                        proceed with future meetings of the Working Groups. On the one hand, if we
                        are to make the Special Committee a useful and meaningful activity, which is
                        an objective we share, we will have to engage the other members in a
                        thorough discussion of current nuclear planning ultimately focused on the
                        question of specifying how the Europeans can become more effectively
                        involved in nuclear planning and crisis consultation. On the other hand this
                        seems certain to involve not only the release of sensitive military
                        information but also disclosure of sensitive political relationships between
                        heads of government; most importantly, it will require our coming to grips
                        with the question of just how much of a voice we are prepared to give our
                        allies in the planning of nuclear forces and in consultations regarding
                        their use. Although in general we want to be forthcoming, there is obviously
                        a point beyond which we are not prepared to go. Moreover, the decision as to
                        the extent to which it is in the US national interest, both generally and
                        specifically, to so engage our allies, can only be made at the highest
                        levels of government.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of the foregoing considerations, it seems to me the following
                        guidance should be applicable for all US personnel in the conduct of
                        meetings and discussions under aegis of the Special Committee and its
                        Working Groups: <list>

                                guided by the principle of maximum allied participation in the
                                various stages of nuclear planning and consultation, but</item>

                            <item>That such proposals clearly identify instances that will require
                                disclosure of sensitive military or political information or which
                                will lead to commitments for any significantly increased allied
                                involvement in any aspect of US nuclear planning and consultation,
                                so that,</item>

                                explicit review by our Strategy Group and we may take whatever
                                actions for securing subsequent approval as may appear appropriate
                                (including specifically forwarding proposals to our respective

                        again early in March to conduct the review suggested in 3. above, as well as
                        to consider other related business.</p>

                        <p>Colonel <persName>Donaldson</persName> of the Joint Staff reported on the
                            first meeting of Working Group I (Intelligence and Data Exchange) which
                            was held in Paris on February 7–8. He characterized the meeting as being
                            generally very successful, and no major issues arose. Agreement was
                            reached <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0373"/>on a questionnaire to
                            be sent to the Standing Group, <gloss target="#t_SACLANT1">SACLANT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss> which
                            would develop information on current arrangements for exchange of
                            intelligence and related data. The initial scope of the Working Group is
                            to consider data related to the use of nuclear weapons in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area only. The terms of reference of
                            the Working Group were broadened to include data on allied forces as
                            well as intelligence data. At the next meeting the members of the
                            Working Group will exchange papers on what data they believe their Heads
                            of Government will need for consultation regarding the use of nuclear
                            weapons. In response to a question by Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>,
                            Colonel <persName>Donaldson</persName> indicated that the data to be
                            exchanged will include political as well as military information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that it appeared that this Working
                            Group will quickly get into issues involving high level political
                            relationships between Heads of Government which would directly concern
                            the President. He asked whether the Working Group was receiving adequate
                            political guidance. Colonel <persName>Donaldson</persName> noted that
                            Mr. <persName>Gannett</persName> of <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>
                            was working with the US representatives of the Working Group. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> noted that it was important that we did
                            not start down paths which would commit the President to provide
                            information, or to enter into consultations which he might not be
                            willing to undertake. He noted that, based on his experience with crisis
                            situations, he felt sure the President will want to maintain freedom of
                            action as to whom he consults with, about what, and under what
                            conditions. For example, the President would not be likely to relish the
                            idea of 14 colored phones ringing in his office during an acute
                            international crisis. General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> noted that at the military level also the
                            question of exchange of military information will require very careful
                            looking at; he would not want exchange of military information to be
                            automatic.</p>

                        <p>General Starbird reported on the initial meeting of Working Group II
                            which was held in Paris, February 8–10. The Working Group agreed to
                            submit three questionnaires designed to obtain an inventory of current
                            communication resources in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. The
                            first questionnaire is directed at Supreme Commanders and is designed to
                            elicit information on the communication capabilities which they have
                            between each other and to the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, the
                            Standing Group and national authorities. The second questionnaire is
                            directed to national authorities, and is designed to elicit information
                            on communication capabilities between national authorities and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> civilian and military bodies. The
                            third questionnaire is directed to communications capabilities between
                            member nations. Questionnaires are being addressed to all 14 <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. They will not go into

                            hopes to hold a meeting with Working Group I once the questionnaires are
                            completed to provide the results of their survey and to obtain guidance
                            from Working Group I as to what data Heads of Government may wish to
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>Starbird</persName> noted that the committee effort so
                            far is largely “marking time” until they can receive inputs from Working
                            Groups I and III. Nevertheless, the following issues have already
                            emerged: <list>

                                        <persName>Starbird</persName> has requested <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> to reexamine a previous

                                <item>The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, supported by Canada,
                                    took the position that consultation would obviously be centered
                                    in <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and was initially opposed
                                    to sending out a questionnaire relating to communications
                                    between governments. General <persName>Starbird</persName>
                                    convinced them that the effort to elicit information would not
                                    prejudge the means of consultation, and they finally agreed to
                                    the third questionnaire.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked what the US philosophy was on the
                            use of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> for consultation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Spiers</persName> replied that it is considered as an
                            option, but not the only one and this is one of the questions to be
                            explored by the Special Committee. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            noted that he considered secure written communications to be generally
                            preferable to secure voice, General <persName>Starbird</persName>
                            pointed out that Ambassador Cleveland had noted the possible requirement

                            in Washington. He pointed out that <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>
                            already had recommended to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> against the inclusion of substantive
                            conclusions in the report from Working Group III to the Special
                            Committee, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has
                            agreed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said they
                            were not sure what bilateral discussions would take place, but clearly
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would have to talk
                            with Minister Healey about F–111’s, and would want to talk to Minister
                            Von Hassel about German aid for Turkey. He would probably also want to
                            talk to the Turkish Defense Minister about Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>’s forthcoming visit to
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>As to where the Special Committee is to go from here, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> acknowledged that they are
                            faced by a dilemma. On the one hand, there really is a desire on Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s part to get the
                                <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0375"/>Europeans (and when Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> says the Europeans,
                            what he really means is the Germans and, specifically, Von Hassel) more
                            heavily involved in the details of nuclear problems. But, as we get
                            further into detail, we run into areas where the US just doesn’t have
                            all the answers as yet, or if we do, the answers raise major policy
                            issues. For example, the problems involved in deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and ADMs in Europe. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wants a follow-on meeting in
                            April which would deal with tactical nuclear forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> couldn’t predict where they
                            would go from here. They would probably want to establish groups of
                            experts to meet between meetings of the Working Group, but they had made
                            no final decision on this as yet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked what the philosophy was on the
                            approach to the meetings and specifically whether they want to string
                            them out or come to conclusions rapidly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> pointed out that here again
                            there was a dilemma. If Working Group III went on for too long, it could
                            become an institution and be subject to attack by the French. On the
                            other hand, they certainly wanted to extend its life beyond the June
                            Ministerial Meeting, again with the French in mind. How long the Working
                            Group III meetings are extended really depends on how well the first few
                            meetings go. He thought that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Minister Healey were optimistic. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> said that he favored keeping it going
                            as a Working Group as long as it was productive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schaetzel</persName> said that it is important to make a
                            record to show that we really tried to make the group succeed, but if we
                            prolonged it indefinitely, it would play into French hands. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>’s view was we
                            should certainly keep the group going for a while, but not forever. He
                            also noted that it was the Germans’ clear view, as expressed in the
                            paper they sent us, that they do not want the Special Committee to
                            compete with the hardware solution. Mr. <persName>Spiers</persName>
                            noted that much of the problem arises from <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> pressure to make the Special Committee a substitute for
                            a hardware solution. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that this
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> position is counterproductive. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> summarized the objectives as expressed
                            by the group as being “without prejudice to the hardware solution to
                            make the Special Committee as meaningful as possible and to keep it
                            going so long as it was being productive.” Mr.
                                <persName>Weiss</persName> noted there was a dilemma between
                            providing enough information and sense of sharing to keep the Europeans
                            engaged, while at the same time not committing the US government to
                            consultation procedures and planning that we are not prepared to follow
                            through on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> then noted several
                            possible proposals that had been made for involving the Allies in
                            nuclear planning. These include (a) placing national representatives at
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>, (b) hot lines between national
                            governments, (c) joint studies of such subjects as <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and ADMs, <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0376"/>as
                            suggested in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>’s
                                memorandum,<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> and (d) examination with the allies of the
                            requirements for the next generation of weapons systems.</p>
                        <p>At this point, Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked whether we were
                            trying to press our conclusions with respect to force structure and
                            strategy on the allies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> acknowledged that to some extent Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> does want them to
                            reach the same conclusions as we have reached. (For example, that there
                            is no need for additional <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s.) But,
                            he also said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was
                            mindful of the need not to overdo this. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said that he very much agreed with the
                            approach suggested in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName>’s
                            memorandum to set up groups of experts under Working Group III to
                            discuss specific problems. The problem was what subjects could we get
                            into and which subjects should we avoid because we didn’t have all the
                            answers, or couldn’t provide the necessary information. Mr.
                                <persName>Spiers</persName> noted that a number of useful proposals
                            had now been made which would involve the allies in nuclear planning and
                            suggested that we set up a US Working Group under the aegis of the
                            Strategy Discussion Group to examine these proposals and to develop a US
                            position on what we were prepared to offer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> again emphasized
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thinks of the
                            objectives of Working Group III principally in terms of the Germans.
                            Ideally, he would like to see US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-German discussion of these issues for the principal purpose
                            of educating the Germans and of involving Minister Von Hassel more in
                            the details of nuclear planning. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> noted the strong objections of the Italians
                            to trilateral meetings, and asked State how serious we felt these
                            Italian objections were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schaetzel</persName> replied that there is no question that
                            this a real problem and that we cannot ignore the Italian objections if
                            we want to keep them committed to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                            He pointed out that the people in Italy who raised these objections were
                            real friends of the US and supporters of European unity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> asked how can we proceed
                            fruitfully to achieve our objectives with the Germans? Mr.
                                <persName>Schaetzel</persName> suggested that we should meet with
                            the Germans bilaterally rather than trilaterally. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> expressed the view that
                            this was not as effective. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that
                            State had no question but that the Germans were the key target, but we,
                            nevertheless, had the problem of how to deal with the Italian objections
                            to trilateralism.</p>
                        <p>Further expounding on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s views with respect to the Special Committee,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> does see it as a
                            possible alternative to a hardware solution, that he is anxious to push
                            on to conclusions as rapidly as possible but that he (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>) has cautioned Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> about pushing too
                            fast.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0377"/>
                        <p>General <persName>Seignious</persName>, seconded by General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, pointed out that this
                            first set of briefings would give the Europeans a great deal to absorb.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> went on to
                            express his view that this sort of discussion with the Germans was quite
                            productive based on their experience with the German military. However,
                            he pointed out that it was going to take time for them to absorb US
                            thinking on these complex issues. Mr. <persName>Weiss</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed that it was going to take time.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> also stressed
                            that the Joint Chiefs would want to take a very careful look at the
                            proposal to put national representatives at <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said that he
                            personally liked the idea of discussing the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem with the Germans, but thought that their
                            conclusion would be that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> was just
                            fine for Germany and what do we do then? Mr.
                                <persName>Schaetzel</persName> supported the idea of discussing
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s with the Germans and the
                            British and felt they would be most interested.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGAJ1">Goodpaster</persName> said it was
                            his view that the important thing is not what we discuss, but to engage
                            the Allies in real discussions. He personally felt, based on his
                            discussions with the German military, that there were some real
                            possibilities in the Special Committee if we really engage the Allies in
                            detailed discussion. He also felt it was healthy for them to know that
                            we do not know all the answers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said that the idea
                            of technical experts groups was a good one and that we ought to discuss
                            this at the Working Group III meeting this week. General
                                <persName>Seignious</persName> suggested that the expert groups
                            might well occupy themselves in absorbing the material presented at the
                            briefings. In response to a question from Mr.
                            <persName>Sloss</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> said that they were not in a position to
                            distribute the material from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            briefings. Thus, it was agreed that it would be useful to bring experts
                            here from the other member countries to study the briefing materials in
                            greater detail.</p>

                    <p>Enclosed is a summary table drawn from an evaluation of the programmed U.S.
                        missile force against likely estimates of the future Soviet target system.
                        These estimates are based upon the median estimates of this threat presented
                        in the N.I.E. on Soviet capabilities for strategic attack (N.I.E.
                            11–8–65).<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">
                            <ref target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> Enclosed also are tables
                        containing the detailed assumptions for the analysis. Most of the previous
                        calculations that you have seen for this time period have treated the U.S.
                        Assured Destruction capability in the face of a maximum plausible Soviet
                        threat. By contrast the enclosed calculations are relevant to the U.S.
                        combined Assured Destruction/Damage Limiting capability against a more
                        likely Soviet threat. These calculations strongly suggest that U.S.
                        capabilities to attack the likely Sino-Soviet target system will increase
                        sharply over the period 1966 to 1971. By 1971 our ballistic missile force
                        alone, operating in pre-emption, would be able to destroy the major part of
                        their strategic offensive forces. To compare the 1971 force with the current
                        force, we have assumed that [<hi rend="italic">8–1/2 lines of source text
                            not declassified</hi>]. In terms of residual opposing weapons, instead
                        of average kill against the target systems, the performance is even more
                        impressive. When bomber weapons are also included in U.S. counter-military
                        strikes, this effectiveness would be further enhanced.</p>
                    <p>The calculations summarized above utilized a targeting procedure as much like
                        that of the <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> as we could make it. We
                        used a median threat without <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s or
                        extremely high numbers of Soviet hardened missiles to test the ability of
                        our missile forces to destroy military targets for the Damage Limiting
                        mission. We are now in the process of calculating performance when targeting
                        is designed to minimize Soviet damage potential, instead of following [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>

                    <p>I expect to use the calculations in this paper in the next Presidential
                        Memorandum on Strategic Offensive and Defensive Forces, and compare the
                        results with others that assume larger missile forces withheld for the
                        urban-industrial task. Additionally, since the results are so striking, a
                        copy of the enclosed table has been made available for the back-up book for
                        your congressional testimony. I will, of course, send you the full paper if
                        you are interested in pursuing this any further.</p>

                                        for unreliability is an operation in which new missiles are
                                        assigned and launched to cover the targets of missiles that
                                        have failed in launch. The amount of the total unreliability

                            opportunity to shape the world to our disadvantage. The role of US
                            military forces in this concept is (1) primarily, to deter the use of
                            hostile force and, if deterrence fails, to enable the United States
                            together with its allies to defeat the enemy, and (2) secondarily, to
                            participate in nonwar diplomatic, economic, and psychological operations

                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The over-all strategic concept
                            designed to support US national goals and achieve US military objectives
                            is to prevent or to defeat aggression wherever and whenever US national
                            interests are adversely affected. This requires (1) a military posture
                            of sufficient strength and flexibility to permit exercise of the
                            initiative by the United States in the conduct of military, political,
                            and economic affairs and (2) <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0385"/>the coordination and exploitation to best advantage of all instruments
                            of national power. Deterrence, collective security, and flexible
                            response are the basic elements of this concept.</p>
                        <p>6. (C) Deterrence of a nuclear exchange is the first responsibility of US
                            strategy since national survival is clearly at stake; at the same time,
                            US strategy must also provide for the capability to deter aggression at
                            any lesser level of conflict. To insure deterrence, US forces must be
                            clearly capable of making both direct and indirect attack on the United
                            States or its interests grossly unattractive and unprofitable. The
                            military capability to control, defeat, or destroy the enemy and the
                            firm resolve of the United States to use its forces if required must be
                            obvious as well as real.</p>
                        <p>7. (C) Collective security involves the acquisition, the development, and
                            stability of those allies who can now or ultimately will contribute to
                            US security interests world-wide.</p>
                        <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Flexible response is essential to
                            the prevention of conflict escalation and is, therefore, an inextricable
                            element of deterrence. Flexible response requires a combination of
                            modern, mobile, and balanced forces which will permit the exercise of a
                            wide range of options to employ military forces under varying conditions
                            and threats to achieve US objectives.</p>
                        <p>9. (C) Translation of these considerations into a force structure depends
                            on the interaction in the world environment between US national goals
                            and the threat to their accomplishment.</p>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The most dangerous threat to US
                                interests is posed by the strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet
                                Union. This threat is so serious—regardless of the estimated
                                intentions of Soviet leaders—that it must receive primary cognizance
                                in the formulation of military strategy and in the development of
                                adequate countering force levels. Concurrently, it must be
                                recognized that, without ever resorting to a strategic nuclear <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0386"/>attack, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and/or the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> could expand the
                                communist-dominated world until the United States and its allies are
                                finally isolated and subjected to piecemeal domination.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now has the capability to conduct a massive

                                surface-to-surface missiles, and submarine-launched missiles. The
                                Soviet strategic offensive force of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_SLCM1">SLCM</gloss>s/<gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s, the heavy bombers, and some
                                medium bombers can wreak enormous damage on the United States in a
                                first strike but cannot at the present time destroy enough of the US
                                strategic nuclear force to preclude retaliatory destruction of the
                                Soviet Union as a viable society. Additionally and apart from Soviet
                                nuclear capabilities, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/Warsaw Pact and the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> have significant conventional forces which pose
                                major threats to the Free World.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Without a clear belief that
                                they would emerge as the dominant world power, Soviet leaders are
                                not likely to initiate deliberately a strategic nuclear exchange.
                                This does not preclude the possibility of strategic nuclear war
                                through escalation or miscalculation. Further, the United States
                                cannot safely discount the possibility that Soviet leaders might
                                launch a pre-emptive strike if they considered themselves
                                irretrievably committed in a confrontation or if they believed a
                                nuclear attack on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was
                                imminent.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The fact that the United States
                                and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> each has the ability
                                to inflict extensive destruction on the other, regardless of which
                                strikes first, has a paradoxical impact on the formulation of
                                military strategy. It decreases the likelihood of strategic nuclear
                                war but increases the necessity that the United States maintain a
                                balanced strategic nuclear force superior to that of the Soviet
                                Union. It increases the importance of conventional military power
                                but inhibits its application in direct confrontation between major
                                powers because of the risks of escalation. It diminishes the role of
                                lesser powers in high-intensity conflicts but enlarges their role in
                                mid-and low-intensity conflicts.</item>

                                are expected to remain superior to those of any other nation for the
                                period of this appraisal, provided no unbalancing arms control or
                                disarmament agreements are negotiated. The actual and potential
                                nuclear capability of the United Kingdom is not considered to be in
                                competition with US interests. France’s nuclear efforts are weighted
                                more toward a political and psychological effect than toward a
                                direct military threat and are aimed primarily at gaining leadership
                                in Europe. However, in the current worldwide environment and
                                considering the militant and sometimes irrational orientation of
                                Chinese communist officials, the growing nuclear capability of the

                                less than that of France for the next decade—constitutes a
                                significant political, psychological, and military threat to US
                                security interests.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> has initiated a long-range, broad-based program in
                                support of nuclear weapons development. A weaponized version of
                                their 1964 fission device probably is available now in limited
                                numbers, and Communist China at this time has some bombers—but no
                                missiles—capable of delivering nuclear weapons. There are
                                indications of some developmental work on <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and construction of missile launching submarines;
                                however, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> appears to be
                                concentrating first on obtaining <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s. By 1970, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>
                                could have sufficient medium range missiles and warheads to threaten
                                peripheral states. Hence, nuclear attack and nuclear blackmail
                                become feasible <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> courses of
                                action in the Western Pacific-Asian area. Additionally, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> may be able to pose a limited
                                nuclear threat to the United States and to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by the early 1970’s. Communist
                                China certainly will attempt to exploit these capabilities, as well
                                as its large conventional forces, to threaten its neighbors and to
                                undermine US commitments in the Asian area without, however,
                                subjecting its growing potential to serious risk.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) There is no longer a communist
                                bloc in the traditional sense of a monolithic structure subservient
                                to Moscow. Independent factions are developing because of the
                                growing tendency of East European countries to emphasize national
                                rather than ideological and bloc ambitions as well as because of the
                                increasingly bitter Sino-Soviet dispute which has its deepest roots
                                in national rather than ideological differences. The trend in Europe
                                toward independent national policies probably will be enhanced by
                                increased East-West trade and other forms of communications
                                stimulated by historical orientation. Although there may be some
                                temporary accommodations for purposes of expediency, the Sino-Soviet
                                rift is likely to persist and, in the absence of overt war between
                                the United States and either the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, to

                                intensify their activities in areas of interest to the United
                                States; on the other hand, the rift, for as long as it continues,
                                lessens the magnitude of the otherwise combined military threat to
                                the United States.</item>

                            <item>(C) The underdeveloped world is particularly susceptible to
                                communist insurgency because of the prevailing militant and immature
                                nationalism coupled with the instability inherent in the
                                modernization process. The coming decade is likely to be critical
                                because of revolutionary trends stemming from the inability of
                                governments to cope with social and economic problems; further,
                                exacerbation of this situation by the disruptive competition between

                                be anticipated. Whether the continuing conflicts in the

                                political and economic will depend on two factors: (1) the success
                                of the current US military effort in Vietnam and (2) the ability of
                                the Free World to execute effective political, economic,
                                psychological, and military preventive programs.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In summary, of all the forms of
                                warfare, general nuclear war, although the most dangerous threat, is
                                the least probable for the next decade. Continued low-intensity
                                conflict, particularly in the underdeveloped portion of the world,
                                is almost certain. Limited war in the underdeveloped areas is a
                                continuing possibility because (1) militant and immature nationalism
                                prevails in many states; (2) there remain many traditional
                                unresolved issues between neighboring states and races; and (3)
                                there will be the possibility of escalation of Soviet or <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>-instigated insurgencies. Limited
                                war in the developed portion of the world is unlikely because (1)
                                the dangers of escalation are magnified by the intimate involvement
                                of both US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> interests and
                                (2) the relative postures of the advanced states are sufficiently
                                balanced that each would be reluctant to initiate a limited war
                                without explicit US or <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> backing
                                which is considered unlikely in the absence of extreme provocation
                                (e.g., a serious threat to the allied position in Berlin or Western
                                military intervention in an East German uprising).</item>

                                question of the likelihood of conflict is recognition that the most
                                important single factor in deterring Moscow, Peking, or their allies
                                from the use of force in any portion of the conflict spectrum is
                                opposing military power—the existence of superior US strategic
                                nuclear capabilities and US military presence at, or an obvious
                                capability to deploy military power rapidly to, the point of
                                contest. With its allies the United States is presently superior
                                militarily and has the potential to exert superior military force
                                globally if it decides that the situation merits the requisite
                                military, political, and economic decisions. Nevertheless, the
                                Sino-Soviet schism bears so importantly <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0389"/>on US strategic planning that, should there be a

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Soviet Union is improving
                                its strategic nuclear posture relative to that of the United States.
                                It undoubtedly will seek continued qualitative and quantitative
                                force improvements and may be seeking to enhance its relative
                                posture through arms control agreements. Primary Soviet efforts have
                                focused on a build-up of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s; the
                                hardening and dispersing of missile sites; developing active air and
                                missile defense systems; an increased mobility of land-based and
                                sea-based ballistic missile systems. There is evidence that the
                                Soviets are deploying a ballistic missile defense (<gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss>) system, and are working on larger
                                nuclear warheads with compatible delivery vehicles; and they have
                                the capability to develop and deploy multiple independently guided
                                re-entry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s). The
                                Soviets probably could attain an operational capability with a
                                    <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> in the period 1970–1975.
                                They could already have developed a limited antisatellite capability
                                based on an operational missile (e.g., the SS–4) with a nuclear
                                warhead and on existing electronic facilities. A breakthrough or
                                major advance in any of these areas could alter, in their favor, the
                                present ratio of the US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                strategic nuclear postures unless the United States, through its own

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) There are three basic
                                disparities between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which must be considered in
                                determining the minimum US strategic nuclear force levels. First,
                                the Soviet Union, as a closed society, has an advantage in thwarting
                                intelligence collection; it can secretly increase its forces
                                quantitatively and qualitatively with less chance of detection than
                                if the United States made the same attempt. Second, the Soviet Union
                                probably has less inhibitions about executing a first strike. Third,
                                there are significant differences in population distribution which,
                                in conjunction with higher missile payload capacities, favor the
                                Soviet Union. Hence, equality in US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic nuclear forces is less than parity for
                                the United States when the asymmetry in intelligence, in population
                                distribution, and in willingness to strike first are considered. <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0390"/>Thus, the strategic nuclear
                                advantage must be clearly in our favor both actually and in the view

                            <item>(C) Arms control is a desirable objective for national security
                                policy if it actually reduces the likelihood of the outbreak of war.
                                However, an arms control or disarmament agreement which resulted in
                                a state or a group of states improving its military posture
                                vis-à-vis other states probably would be more destabilizing than
                                stabilizing. There is ample evidence that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other communist states do not
                                subscribe to the idea of arms control in the same way Western
                                governments do, to include the traditional and doctrinal attitude of
                                communist states toward treaties and agreements. A fully adequate
                                verification system in effect prior to implementation of any arms
                                control or disarmament agreement is essential to US security.</item>

                                test ban treaties are cases in point. There are serious gaps in US
                                hard intelligence about Soviet knowledge and capabilities in the
                                newest weapon effects areas; in fact, there are indications that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> already may have made
                                gains in nuclear weapons technology beyond current US capabilities.
                                Should probable Soviet developments in <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss> systems with drastically improved nuclear effects
                                warheads be deployed prior to compensating accomplishments by the
                                United States, the military balance of power could be critically
                                upset in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                Vigorous nuclear testing within the restrictions of the present
                                Limited Test Ban Treaty is necessary to permit the United States to
                                increase effectiveness and better to assure survival of its
                                offensive nuclear weapons and defensive systems against the effects
                                of the improved Soviet nuclear weapons. To stop or even further to
                                limit testing would foreclose the possibility of attaining essential
                                knowledge of <gloss target="#t_BMD1">BMD</gloss>, of improved silo

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Space competence is important
                                to national security just as it is to national growth and prestige.
                                In recent Moscow parades, the Soviets displayed what they alleged to
                                be an orbital missile. Despite a number of Soviet allusions to
                                “orbital rockets,” probably advanced for propaganda purposes, it is
                                not believed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has an
                                orbital bombardment capability, and there is no evidence of an
                                intention to develop such systems. It is estimated that the Soviets
                                will not deploy offensive weapons in space within the next ten
                                years. However, it is clear that Soviet space technology is well
                                advanced, and their current peaceful objectives in this medium
                                sooner or later may be accompanied by hostile demonstrations or acts
                                seeking to obtain a military advantage in space. A lack of parallel
                                or countervailing space capabilities would place the United States
                                at a disadvantage, regardless of its earth-based strategic deterrent
                                strength.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) A significant destabilizing
                                element in the world environment is the potential proliferation of
                                nuclear weapons capabilities. There are a number of countries which
                                have the capability to become members of the “Nuclear Club” if they
                                make such a decision, with India, Israel, and Sweden being the most
                                likely to do so in the short run. In the long run, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and Japan probably will become the
                                serious contenders. Such nuclear proliferation as may occur over the
                                next ten years is not likely to affect materially the existing
                                thermonuclear duopoly. Although widespread independent national
                                nuclear capabilities are basically deleterious to US security
                                interests, it may not be within the reasonable power of the United
                                States to preclude nuclear proliferation. Even though multilateral
                                nuclear partnership arrangements tend to reduce unilateral US
                                military flexibility, the political and psychological requirements
                                of national policy may be such as to override the military
                                disadvantages. Hence, considering all factors, additional nuclear
                                sharing arrangements may become desirable in specific instances to
                                maintain favorable power relationships.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Evidence indicates that the
                                Soviets can support substantial toxic chemical warfare (<gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>) operations and that research on
                                improving toxic nerve agents and efforts to develop nonlethal
                                incapacitating agents is continuing. The Soviets have a variety of
                                chemical munitions and delivery vehicles for dissemination of
                                chemical agents and they possess a wide range of good defensive
                                    <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> equipment. While Soviet <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> munitions probably will be used in
                                the tactical sense, the Soviets have consistently grouped toxic
                                agents with “weapons of mass destruction” in political and
                                classified military writings. Decision to use such weapons probably
                                will be taken at the highest political level in the Soviet
                                government.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Another factor which could
                                affect the world balance of power in the mid-term is a weakening of
                                alliances, together with a concomitant realignment and greater
                                independence of action within and among the major power sectors. As
                                Western nations grow stronger economically, as their sense of
                                nationalism increases, and as the fear of nuclear war recedes, the
                                Western alliances are becoming less united, and the member states
                                are more inclined to base their individual military forces on
                                national interests rather than alliance requirements. The resurgence
                                of nationalism in East Europe and the broadened relations between
                                Eastern and Western Europe probably will militate against success of
                                Soviet efforts to achieve any additional military, economic, or
                                political integration of the Warsaw Pact. While both East and West
                                European alliance systems can be expected to become less unified, it
                                appears that the communist alliance system will suffer greater
                                disintegration as its members improve their economic status.</item>

                            <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Coupled with the foregoing trend
                                in the alliance structure of the communist and noncommunist camps is
                                the move toward progressive <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0392"/>withdrawal and decreasing military presence in colonial areas by
                                former colonial powers. As colonial power presence has diminished, a
                                corresponding vacuum has developed. France, the Netherlands, and
                                Germany are no longer Asian powers. The United Kingdom is gradually
                                withdrawing militarily from the overseas areas. The power equation
                                has been drastically altered in Africa, although France, Belgium,
                                Portugal, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will retain some
                                presence and influence on that continent. To maintain a power
                                balance, the United States has had and probably will continue to
                                have to fill such military vacuums to varying degrees.</item>

                            <item>(C) The United States, Western Europe, and the Soviet Union each
                                appear economically capable of increasing significantly their
                                military efforts. Since 1945, the US gross national product has
                                risen from approximately $330 billion (in 1964 prices) to $675
                                billion in 1965 while defense expenditures, as a percentage function
                                of GNP, have declined from 12.9 percent in 1954 to 7.9 percent in
                                1965. Although the balance of payments problem has an adverse impact
                                on US forward deployment and military assistance programs, the
                                United States is in a better economic position than either the

                                expenditures and to engage in economic warfare. The economy of West
                                Europe is certainly such that it could support an increased military
                                defense effort as well as simultaneously provide substantial
                                assistance to underdeveloped areas.</item>

                            <item>(C) The increasing economic gap between the developed and
                                underdeveloped areas of the world contributes significantly to
                                international tensions. Economic modernization is a slow, painful
                                process which requires a major effort just to keep up with the
                                population growth. There are already three billion people in the
                                world, most of them living in underdeveloped regions. The United
                                Nations Population Commission estimates that, if present trends
                                continue, the world population will be nearly 7.5 billion by the end
                                of this century. Low agricultural output is a significant limitation
                                in the underdeveloped world. The ability of the United States to
                                produce and distribute food can become an even more significant
                                element of national power. The ability and success of the Free World
                                vis-à-vis that of the communist world to foster democratic
                                capitalism versus communism in the underdeveloped areas will impact
                                on peace and stability during the mid-range period, as well as over
                                the long run, on the balance of world power.</item>

                        <item>(U) Part VI, <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss> 68–75, contains the
                            military advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff relative to the force level
                            objectives they recommend for the mid-range period. It includes an
                            assessment of the current Department of Defense Five-Year Force
                            Structure and Financial Program, and examines alternatives and risks.
                            Phasing required to achieve their recommended force levels and weapon
                            systems development programs for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968–1975 is also included. Particular emphasis is
                            placed on these issues which must be addressed in conjunction with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 budget.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss> 68–75 force objectives were assessed on the basis that
                            requirements which exceed the capabilities of the recommended permanent
                            active establishment would be met either by some combination of partial
                            mobilization, full mobilization and extension of terms of service, or by
                            temporary activation of additional forces. Since the decision to meet
                            these requirements without the selective call-up of reserves appears to
                            be a continuing one, certain temporary adjustments in the force
                            recommendations may be required. These temporary active force
                            adjustments for the nearer time frame, relating specifically to the
                            reserve call-up alternative and keyed to operations in Southeast Asia,
                            are reflected in the Force Tables or, as appropriate, by annotation.
                            Further temporary adjustments may be required as a result of extended
                            deployments and other operations relative to Southeast Asia.</item>

                            Staff did not reach complete agreement on certain programs. There are,
                            however, fewer divergencies in <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>
                            68–75 than in past <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss>s. It is also
                            noted that where there are differences of opinion on force levels, these
                            are in many cases differences in timing rather than in concept or
                            substance. Finally, our experiences associated with the war in Vietnam
                            were heavily weighted in the deliberations and resultant recommendations
                            on General Purpose forces.</item>

                            <p>Studies, analyses and war games completed during the last year
                                indicated trends that are not favorable to the United States. In
                                order to <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0395"/>maintain a
                                credible deterrence we must take great care to assure that we retain
                                clearly superior strategic offensive forces over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This concern is reflected in the
                                unanimous agreement among the Joint Chiefs of Staff on an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 for a follow-on manned bomber, deployment of
                                Poseidon commencing in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 and an
                                    <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973 for an Advanced <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. I agree with these recommendations.</p>
                            <p>I continue to believe that our defensive forces are inadequate in
                                their damage limiting role and in their contribution to a credible
                                deterrence. I accord top priority to the acquisition and deployment
                                at an early date of a ballistic missile defense, and fully agree
                                with the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
                                commence deployment of Nike-X in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                1972. While some questions such as point defense of our offensive
                                forces have not been resolved, I do not believe we should delay the
                                decision to deploy Nike-X.</p>
                            <p>I continue to support the requirement for a follow-on manned
                                interceptor. Although the Joint Chiefs of Staff are not agreed on
                                the ultimate numbers of F–12s to be deployed, they are agreed that
                                deployment of the F–12 should commence in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. In view of the intelligence lead times and the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> capability to deploy
                                supersonic long range bombers, I consider it prudent to include
                                sufficient funds in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                                budget to permit deployment of 12 F–12s in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. The force levels after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972 should be dependent on future evaluations of
                                the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> bomber threat. I continue
                                to believe, along with the majority of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                                that except for normal attrition we should not decrease the number
                                of Century series interceptors in our Continental Air Defense Force
                                prior to the occurrence of a reduction in the strategic bomber
                                threat or the deployment of a follow-on manned interceptor.</p>

                            <p>In agreement with the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                (less the Chief of Staff, US Army), I recommend a force level of
                                27–1/3 division forces. While our recent experience would tend to
                                substantiate an increase in permanent active Army divisions, I join
                                with the Chief of Staff, Air Force and the Commandant of the Marine
                                Corps in deferring judgment on the number and mix of active
                                divisions and brigades until the resolution of the Southeast Asia
                                situation is clearer as well as our future <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments and the resolution of questions
                                concerning rapid deployment and rapid reinforcement. For these same
                                reasons I also defer judgment on the number of sustaining support
                                increments in the permanent active structure.</p>
                            <p>The war in Vietnam, gold flow considerations and uncertainties
                                regarding overseas bases all support the unanimous recommendation of
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a force level of 16 attack carriers
                                and 16 attack carrier air wings in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                                1969. I am in agreement with these force <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0396"/>levels. I continue to support, as do the other
                                members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (less the Chief of Staff, Air
                                Force), the increase in antisubmarine carriers from 9 to 11.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the number of Air Force tactical fighters, our
                                experiences in Southeast Asia and the results of studies indicate an
                                increase in total numbers is required. Recognizing the divergencies
                                of views on total numbers of tactical fighters required, I believe
                                that a reasonable program would be to level off at 30 tactical
                                fighter wings (about 2200 aircraft) pending a more thorough study of
                                our total national tactical air requirements.</p>

                                Chiefs of Staff (less Chief of Staff, Air Force) in deferring
                                judgment on increased force levels pending a better understanding of
                                our strategic mobility requirements for rapid deployment and rapid

                    <p>As you are aware, the Department of Defense has been participating since
                        November 1963 in an interagency effort to develop a national policy on
                        Chemical and Biological (<gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss>) Warfare. This
                        effort was initiated at the instigation of the Arms Control and Disarmament
                        Agency with the approval of the Special Assistant to the President for
                        National Security Affairs (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG2">McGeorge

                        posing the question of a national policy a Defense position had to be
                        established and efforts in this direction have been going on with <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and several offices of <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> contributing. The various actions were
                        closely coordinated with members of your Policy Planning Staff and with Mr.
                            <persName>Barber</persName>.</p>
                    <p>My staff have reviewed the progress to date for me, and I find that the
                        thrust of the effort has essentially evaporated. Rather than resurrect the
                        effort and proceed from where we left off, we should make a fresh start. The
                        only stipulations I would suggest are that (1) we concentrate on arriving at
                        a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> position irrespective of whether we
                        proceed from there to an official national policy position, and (2) we start
                        with face-to-face discussions rather than the distribution of memoranda.</p>
                    <p>I cannot overemphasize the importance of a <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> position. Lack of this is reflected in ambiguity and
                        indecision in the <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> planning of the military
                        departments and <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> offices. If we are to
                        spend our resources wisely, an agreed upon position has to be generated. Dr.
                            <persName>MacArthur</persName> of my staff is quite willing to assume
                        responsibility for the coordination of the <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> position provided you are in agreement. If you would
                        nominate a senior member of your staff, Dr. <persName>MacArthur</persName>
                        would like to meet with your nominee at an early date and agree on a course
                        of action.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>Since November 1963, in compliance with a request of the Special Assistant to
                        the President for National Security Affairs, this Agency has been conducting
                        studies on the arms control and disarmament aspects of chemical and
                        biological warfare. Concurrently, in response to the same directive the
                        Departments of State and Defense have been conducting studies concerning
                        those areas relating to <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons where they
                        have prime responsibility and interest. The ultimate objective of these
                        related studies is to formulate an agreed inter-agency statement of policy
                        which could be developed into national policy guidance.</p>
                    <p>The attached paper, titled “Chemical and Biological Warfare Policy”, which is
                        forwarded for your consideration and comment, represents the tentative
                        conclusions of this Agency on policies which the U.S. should adopt with
                        respect to these weapons. It reflects the hypothesis that the spread of
                        lethal chemical and biological weapons to states which do not now possess
                        them is, prima facie, not in the national interest. Part III, titled “Basic
                        Elements of Policy” proposes policies flowing from the hypothesis that are
                        designed to minimize the risk that U.S. actions in the field of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons might encourage other nations to
                        acquire capabilities to use these potentially destabilizing weapons.</p>
                    <p>While it is believed that the suggested policies are in the national
                        interest, there may be compelling military and political factors which
                        militate against their adoption. It is requested, therefore, that in
                        commenting on the attached draft, implications of the policies relating to
                        military capabilities and international relations be emphasized. Your
                        comments on arms control aspects would also be welcome. In light of the
                        delay since inter-agency studies on <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss>
                        weapons were inaugurated, early action on this matter would be
                        appreciated.</p>

                            weapons. Also in November 1963, the Department of State proposed an

                            field, with its goal a statement of related national policy.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U.

                        </p>
                        <p>Since that time, two draft policy papers on <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> warfare have been prepared and circulated for informal
                            comment, one by the Department of Defense in December 1964,<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">See <ref target="#d76fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    76</ref>.</note> and one by the Department of State, in May
                                1965.<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">Not further identified.</note>
                            While each of these papers has helped to narrow down the pertinent
                            problems which require resolution, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>’s concern is that neither one stresses the issue of
                            proliferation commensurate with the evolving threat as we see it. <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> views the spread of chemical and
                            biological weapons of mass destruction to states not now possessing
                            them, particularly the developing states, as not in the national
                            interest and as a threat to world peace. Although studies made in early
                            1964 estimated <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> proliferation not to be
                            imminent, there have been an increasing number of signs since that time,
                            particularly from Israel, the UAR, Iraq and Indonesia, which may
                            indicate the beginnings of a dangerous trend.</p>

                        <p>The policies discussed in this paper are designed to minimize the risk
                            that US actions in the field of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss>
                            weapons might encourage other <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0400"/>nations to acquire capabilities to use these destabilizing weapons.
                            They reflect, for the most part, official statements and policy
                            decisions on such matters as use of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss>
                            weapons, sales of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> munitions to foreign
                            nations, technical assistance and public information in the <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> field, all of which have proliferation
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>We have also suggested a definition for the term “<gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> Weapons of Mass Destruction”, which appears without
                            definition in the US draft outline of a <gloss target="#t_GCD1">GCD</gloss> treaty<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">The quoted phrase

                            for which an agreed definition would be necessary in the event proposals
                            for the control of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons are
                            entertained as separable measures. It is our view that all <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons are not “weapons of mass
                            destruction” as frequently categorized.</p>
                        <p>In addition, this paper suggests an approach to the difficult problem of
                            control of <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons. In so doing, it
                            recognizes that first priority must continue to be placed on the
                            prevention of nuclear war, and that efforts to control <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons should not hinder or delay our
                            efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Our immediate objective in proposing these policies is to present the
                            proliferation aspects of chemical and biological weapons for discussion
                            and comment by interested agencies of the Government. Our ultimate
                            intent is to arrive at an agreed position which can be incorporated into
                            the national policy recommendations that will result from the current
                            inter-agency review of the whole field of chemical and biological
                            weapons.</p>

                    <p>I think you should be aware of the proposal discussed in the attached
                        correspondence for reciprocal exchange with the Soviets of information on
                        procedures for insuring control of nuclear weapons. Although I think that it
                        will be submitted to the White House routinely for clearance if State
                        decides to go ahead with it, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> might bring up the matter at some future Tuesday
                        luncheon.</p>
                    <p>The proposal was originally made by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> in a letter to <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John

                    <p>In principle, I think this proposal is a good idea. In practice, however, I
                        am afraid that, unless it is handled extremely carefully, it could create
                        some real problems that would be counterproductive. The points in paragraph
                        7 of the Chiefs’ paper are illustrative of the kinds of problems that might
                        be involved in such an exchange.</p>
                    <p>The most serious problem is that such a dialogue would naturally lead to
                        questions about the nature of Presidential control and our arrangements with
                        our allies. While one obviously could refuse to discuss the subject or give
                        only very general replies, this could have the effect of creating additional
                        suspicions rather than reassuring the Soviets. If it became known to
                        Congress that such an exchange had taken place, this might lead to renewed
                        interest on the part of various Congressional committees such as the Joint
                        Committee on Atomic Energy as to the details of Presidential authority for
                        the release of nuclear weapons. This is a subject on which the President is
                        very sensitive for obvious political reasons and about which the less said
                        the better.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I think there may be merit in the idea of reassuring the
                        Soviets about our control procedures and informing them of some of the
                        specific equipment, such as Permissive Action Links (<gloss target="#t_PAL1">PAL</gloss>s), that we might wish to encourage them to incorporate in
                        their own weapons. If we decide to go ahead with this project, I would
                        recommend that we simply give the Soviets the specific information that we
                        think they should have, rather than instituting a dialogue or exchange on
                        this subject. In transmitting the information, we could indicate that we
                        would of course be interested in a similar reassurance on their own
                        procedures but not make this a precondition or part of a dialogue on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed the problem along the above lines with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and called to his attention the
                        special area of Presidential interest in the proposal. He indicated that he
                        wants to give the matter further thought to decide whether it should be
                        pursued at all at this time. I have also asked Ben Read to make sure that
                        any action State decides to take on this proposal be cleared with the White
                        House.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> Panel examined the Navy’s <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program during the period May 1964–July
                        1965. This report was completed in August 1965.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">See <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note> Time has not stood
                        still since that date, and in particular the Navy has accelerated or
                        undertaken many important efforts that implement in part certain of the
                        Panel’s recommendations. For example, the Navy has expanded its exercise
                        program and continued to develop an improved analytical capability; the
                        Captor program has been accelerated; much greater coherence is seen in the
                        torpedo-countermeasures program; greater emphasis has been given to
                        anti-ship torpedoes; etc. The Panel is aware of these developments, in broad
                        outline, but for the most part it has not investigated these matters in
                        sufficient detail to attempt to revise the report to take into account new
                        progress. The Panel believes that its assessment of the total <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program remains valid and that its
                        recommendations require further action.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">B. Panel Activities</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>In carrying out its mission, the Panel undertook to examine all relevant
                        technical areas, recognizing that this involved many aspects of <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0405"/>technology and a wide variety of naval
                        programs. We also sought to take full advantage of the wealth of experience
                        accumulated by our naval personnel and by other technical groups, both
                        through an examination of their writings and through personal contacts and
                        discussions. Finally, we sought to gain as much first hand experience as our
                        schedules would allow with the current operational and <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> equipment and with our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces.</p>
                    <p>In so doing, the Panel has considered the present families of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> platforms: 1) submarines, 2) surface ships
                        (destroyers), 3) fixed-wing aircraft, and 4) helicopters; <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> sensors: 1) fixed acoustic surveillance
                        systems, 2) submarine-borne active and passive sonar, 3) ship-borne active
                        and passive sonar, 4) variable-depth sonar (<gloss target="#t_VDS1">VDS</gloss>) either towed or free-swimming, 5) helicopter-dipped sonar,
                        6) sonobuoys, 7) airborne magnetic anomaly detection (<gloss target="#t_MAD1">MAD</gloss>), and 8) radar; <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> weapons: 1) Mk-37, Mk-44 and Mk-46 acoustic homing
                        torpedoes, 2) mines, and 3) nuclear armed torpedoes or depth charges,
                        including such delivery methods as anti-submarine surface launched rockets
                            (<gloss target="#t_ASROC1">ASROC</gloss>), submarine launched rockets
                            (<gloss target="#t_SUBROC1">SUBROC</gloss>), and drone anti-submarine
                        helicopters (<gloss target="#t_DASH1">DASH</gloss>); and <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> fire-control and data-processing techniques
                        and equipment.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these primary technical areas, the Panel has examined in some
                        depth the Naval organization for <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> in
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, including in particular the Navy’s
                        programs and techniques for developing, testing and evaluating systems and
                        equipment. The Panel has also been concerned with manning requirements and
                        training, ship automation, reliability and serviceability, the methods by
                        which <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> effectiveness is measured, and the
                        rationale for force-level determination. The Panel explored deeply with the
                        Navy the detailed nature of the intelligence available on the Soviet
                        submarine threat, and some members of the Panel went more extensively into
                        the total store of intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Members of the Panel participated in <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        carrier task force exercises, visited shore-based sound surveillance
                        systems, flew in shorebased and carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft and in
                        helicopters, sailed on destroyers hunting submarines, spent several days on
                        nuclear-powered killer-submarines (<gloss target="#t_SSKN1">SSKN</gloss>) of
                        the most advanced types (Plunger-Thresher), and witnessed trial firings of
                        Polaris missiles from nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines (<gloss target="#t_SSBN1">SSBN</gloss>s). The Panel also visited naval
                        laboratories and facilities, as well as the headquarters of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, both Atlantic and Pacific. In addition,
                        the Panel has had constant contact with the staffs of <gloss target="#t_DDRE1">DDR&amp;E</gloss> and the Department of the Navy, as
                        well as a joint meeting with a United Kingdom <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> panel under Dr. <persName>John Kendrew</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Thus, we believe that we have examined the relevant technical areas. We have
                        benefited greatly by our contacts with naval personnel <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0406"/>and by the work of other technical groups.
                        Although we were able to visit many naval establishments and to examine much
                        equipment firsthand, we were not able to do so to the extent that we would
                        have liked and have instead had to rely to a great extent on the available
                        technical data. We believe that the available data have been provided by the
                        Department of Defense and the Navy; as we received these data we were
                        gradually led to the conclusion that one of the primary weaknesses in our
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program was the scarcity of
                        technical and scientific personnel in positions which carried real
                        management responsibility and/or authority.</p>
                    <p>In this report, the technical material and supporting arguments are to be
                        found in Sections III through VII; conclusions and recommendations are
                        contained in each of these sections; however, the major ones have been
                        extracted and are to be found in the summary section (Part II). A first
                        reading of the material should include at least Parts II and III.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">A. The Submarine Threat</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The submarine threat to the United States is very substantial and will remain
                        so indefinitely. As a measure of its intensity, we can note that the Soviet
                        Union has a fleet of approximately 350 long range submarines of which 40 are
                        nuclear and 310 conventional; that China has already built one and will
                        probably build more copies of the Soviet diesel-electric G-class submarine
                        which is capable of firing short range ballistic missiles while surfaced;
                        and that such lesser powers as Indonesia and Egypt have been given Soviet
                        submarines and can, therefore, pose a threat to elements of our naval forces
                        in limited wars. Without question, submarines will with time become
                        available to more and more nations perhaps including South American
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>We found it useful to classify the submarine threat in the following
                        important categories:</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>Submarines carrying nuclear weapons which can be used against <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> by the Soviet Union now and by
                            China in perhaps five years, as a deterrent force.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> submarines which would be used
                            against our Naval forces (i.e., carrier and amphibious landing force)
                            and against merchant shipping which might be carrying out theater
                            support in a limited war.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Submarines of small powers which might be used as in para 2. Although
                            we do not have detailed knowledge of the technical characteristics of
                            the newer Soviet submarines, we have some quantitative data to support
                            the conclusion that, with the possible exception of the most recent
                            classes whose acoustic characteristics are not well known, current
                            Soviet submarines are relatively noisy—except, of course, when <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0407"/>they work on battery. In
                            addition, nuclear submarines may possess a very small separate machinery
                            plant to allow long endurance “creep” operation at reduced noise level.
                            This does not mean that the Soviets may not now be developing relatively
                            quiet nuclear subs, as we have done, or even fuel-cell powered quiet
                            submarines. In fact, it is hard for us to assume otherwise since the
                            Soviets certainly have the technical capability to do so and they are
                            surely aware of the fact that noise is a key weakness in their
                            subs.</item>

                        <hi rend="italic">B. Our Capability</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our capability in <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> depends on a composite
                        of sensors, ordnance, platforms to carry the sensors and ordnance, and
                        tactics for their utilization. The sensors which are used for detection and
                        classification, location, and tracking of submarines include active and
                        passive sonar, <gloss target="#t_MAD1">MAD</gloss>, radar, and even visual
                        sighting. These sensors must work in the open ocean, which is a complex
                        medium with poorly determined properties that vary with both time and
                        location. The platforms in which the sensors are installed include surface
                        ships, submarines, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, sonobuoys, as well as
                        fixed platforms in our coastal water and other critical areas. The
                        effectiveness of each element, or combination of elements, of course, also
                        depends strongly on the technical characteristics and the tactics of the
                        enemy submarines.</p>
                    <p>No one device or tactic plays a predominant role in our capability to detect,
                        classify, locate and kill enemy submarines, and our capability is indeed a
                        result of the combined use of the elements which make up our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces. We do not foresee at this time any
                        single new invention, development, or discovery which would by itself
                        drastically alter this interdependence. The Panel does recognize that if
                        large surface-effect naval vessels such as the Captured Air Bubble (CAB)
                        ship could be successfully developed, they would, because of their great
                        speed, be substantially less vulnerable to submarines than present types of
                        vessels. It also recognizes that a reduction in the noise output of <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> submarines would greatly reduce our
                        over-all effectiveness, but would affect the elements of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces differentially to different
                        degrees.</p>
                    <p>Assessing our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability for various
                        threats is an extremely difficult task. It cannot be done convincingly by
                        combining in a simple way the performance capability of each of the many
                        elements that make up our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces. It
                        must depend in good part on empirical data from imaginatively and carefully
                        designed naval tests and exercises. These are costly and difficult to
                        design, execute and evaluate, but are nevertheless essential if we are to
                        have any confidence in any assessment of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability. Although efforts to test and evaluate our
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces have been greatly expanded in
                        the past two years, and the quality of the at-sea exercises shows continuing
                        improvement, much still <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0408"/>needs to be
                        done in this very difficult aspect of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>.
                        As a result, we are now in the position that any such assessments are
                        largely based on incomplete, inconsistent and fragmentary data; and any
                        reliable quantitative assessments of our over-all capability is virtually
                        impossible at this time.</p>
                    <p>Quantitative evaluation is fundamental not only in assessing our over-all
                        capability, but also in assessing the desirability of various courses of
                        action at all levels in the <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program,
                        from exploratory development, to component selection, to force design and
                        procurement, to the selection of tactics and <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> strategy. Unless the marked improvement in this area which
                        we have observed over the past two years continues and is expanded, we shall
                        be forced to continue to rely too heavily on judgment in areas in which the
                        rapidity of technological advance has provided opportunities and problems
                        well beyond the scope of past military experience. Although the design,
                        execution and evaluation of appropriate analytical studies, naval tests and
                        exercises are difficult, they must be pursued with increased vigor.</p>
                    <p>In assessing our capabilities, we note that some of the individual components
                        of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces, such as nuclear powered
                        submarines (<gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>s), are clearly qualitatively
                        superior to their Soviet counterparts. We are impressed by the dedication
                        and general quality of the officers in our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces. These forces can clearly cope with the existing
                        submarine threat from any of the smaller nations, although not without some
                        losses. We note also that the Navy has carried out successfully numerous
                        difficult intelligence missions, using components of the <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces, but the analysis of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capabilities against the Soviet threat is
                        still a complex problem. We can, however, say that our currently programmed
                        (5 year) <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces would have extreme
                        difficulty in denying to the Soviet Union a submarine-launched nuclear
                        second strike capability which is a substantial augmentation of their
                        land-based strategic nuclear forces.<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4">We note
                            that since the publication of the draft of this report, greater emphasis
                            has been devoted to the concept of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                            blockades at sea; neither of these changes in emphasis is evaluated in
                            this report. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Our active <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> is not good enough and our detection net is
                        too soft do this.</p>
                    <p>By addressing ourselves to the specific threat, we may be able to acquire the
                        capability of denying the Chinese a credible nuclear deterrent as long as
                        the Chinese deterrent is based solely on a few G-class subs with short-range
                        missiles aimed at West Coast targets. A detailed study of this threat and of
                        possible techniques to counteract it is clearly warranted.</p>
                    <p>Although we believe that being prepared for an all-out non-nuclear war in
                        Europe in the style of World War II may be somewhat unrealistic, <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0409"/>we emphasize that in most of the
                        information provided to the Panel, a large fraction (1/2 to 1/3) of
                        currently programmed <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces was
                        justified primarily for this purpose. Nevertheless, our capability is poor
                        to protect against substantial loss in sustained conveying of groups of 50
                        to 150 slow merchant ships in the face of a concerted attack by a Soviet
                        submarine force. The fact that the Navy was unable to present to the Panel a
                        current carefully-thought-out and realistic convoy doctrine or policy (and
                        probably has an insufficient number of torpedoes if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> uses countermeasures) is symptomatic of
                        the uncertainty even the Navy has in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the protection of carriers, amphibious forces and replenishment
                        groups against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> submarine force, we
                        appear to be placing a great deal of reliance on the effectiveness of the
                        SQS–26 sonar used in bottom-bounce and convergence zone modes. Our limited
                        (and inadequate) collection of oceanographic data does not support
                        confidence in the bottom-bounce and convergence zone operations over large
                        areas of the oceans and this leads us to doubt that detection will be
                        achieved with a consistency sufficient to permit effective escort protection
                        in many of the situations postulated for its use. Moreover, we believe that
                        the potential effectiveness of our <gloss target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>/SS
                        barriers has been overestimated, principally because enemy attacks,
                        variations in enemy tactics, and even simple torpedo countermeasures have
                        not been realistically assessed. Thus, we conclude that our carriers,
                        amphibious forces, and replenishment groups are likely to be much more
                        vulnerable to submarine attack, either by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or by the smaller nations possessing <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> submarines, than has been stated in
                        Memoranda to the President and presentations to the Congress on the basis of
                        the Official Navy Study Cyclops II. In the case of small nations, for which
                        submarine effectiveness is alleged to be very poor because of the
                        inexperience of native crews, we note in particular that identification of
                        the nation to which a W-class submarine belongs poses difficult technical
                        and political problems and that the operational readiness of these
                        submarines could rapidly be enhanced through appropriate use of “volunteer”
                        crews.</p>

                    <p>Considering the total submarine threat to the U.S., the very costly, but, in
                        our view, inefficient program we mount to counter the important categories
                        of the threat, and considering the high cost and low effectiveness of adding
                        to our force structure many of the platforms, devices, techniques, etc., now
                        being considered by the Navy, we conclude that some portion of the budget
                        originally planned for the further operation and acquisition of present
                        types of systems should be re-allocated to improvement programs to increase
                        those systems substantially in effectiveness <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0410"/>from their present marginal levels. Many of these systems,
                        in fact, have considerable potential for improvement. Further acquisition of
                        larger numbers of marginal or ineffective systems would provide far less
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> defense for our dollar than will
                        such improvement programs.</p>

                    <p>The structuring and utilization of the various elements in our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces constitute a systems problem in its
                        most challenging form. The interdependence of the elements with each other
                        must be appreciated and accounted for. Major commitments either for
                        development or deployment in any one area must be made in the light of an
                        assessment of the net contribution of each element to the over-all system.
                        We cannot afford to neglect systems analysis and management here, even
                        though they are far more difficult than in the strategic military areas
                        where they have been very effectively utilized. On the contrary, because of
                        the greater complexities and the greater number of subtleties involved, it
                        seems to us that an over-all systems approach to <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> would be more fruitful, would reduce unnecessary
                        duplication and redundancy, and could provide more insight than it does in
                        those areas where it is more easily applied. How else can we possibly
                        measure the increase in effectiveness we get for each dollar spent in <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, or even the relative value of investing in
                        different elements of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces, or the

                    </p>
                    <p>The responsibility for <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> in the Navy now is
                        diffused through the many bureaus, laboratories, etc., in the Navy, and we
                        find little evidence of <hi rend="italic">effective</hi> testing, analysis,
                        evaluation or decision-making concerning our over-all <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces. Rather, we have the impression that
                        our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> posture is largely a residue of
                        tradition, of history, and of considerations of “balanced forces” rather
                        than response to the realities of the current and projected threat and the
                        current and projected technology. It is quite natural that past history,
                        tradition, and internal forces within the Navy would have strong influences,
                        but they cannot be allowed to overwhelm whatever hard data, analysis, test
                        results, etc., one can bring to bear on the problem. Clearly, the Navy
                        recognizes its dilemma and has tried in the last year to focus much of the
                        responsibility for <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> in two newly created
                        positions: the Director of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> Programs
                        under the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Manager of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> Systems Projects under the Chief of Naval
                        Materiel. Although we support these actions as steps in the right direction,
                        we consider them inadequate to cope with the problem in spite of the obvious
                        competence, dedication, and serious intent of the individuals chosen to
                        occupy these positions. The new offices do eliminate in part the excessively
                        piecemeal approach of the <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0411"/>old
                        organization, but they seem to have inadequate technical staff and
                        insufficient line authority and responsibility in <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We conclude that the Navy is not yet organized to maximize its <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability, and that to do so would require
                        a major reorganization which would recognize and treat <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> as a technical system and provide greater
                        management focus for responsibility and authority. In order to achieve
                        marked improvements in our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> effectiveness
                        per dollar spent, there must be a high-level organizational element within
                        the Navy with a strong technical staff which would have the responsibility
                        for examining <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the elements of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> and their interrelationship, and would also
                        have the authority to control the major portion of the resources allocated
                        to <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>. It would be only too easy simply to
                        recommend a Polaris type management system for handling <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>. But we recognize that the <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> problem is characterized more by its
                        differences than by its similarities to the Polaris system. We do, however,
                        recommend that the Department of Defense develop a management system for
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> which will have the substance and
                        authority that the Special Projects Office had; but this will evidently
                        require more effort and more technically competent people to manage

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Panel has heard the Navy on a number of occasions on matters relating to
                        the rationale underlying force level development, threat and desired
                        capabilities of Naval forces. The Panel was convinced that the information
                        that was presented to it was inadequate and that the rationale underlying
                        the development of forces has not been adequately developed. In its
                        deliberations the Panel has arrived at a number of conclusions in this area
                        that do not coincide with those of the Navy, and strongly believes that the
                        Navy should devote much greater efforts to the development of a rationale
                        for the employment of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces and of
                        justification for its development and procurement programs.</p>
                    <p>Our primary general conclusion is that our over-all <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capability is very poor in relation to what we should
                        expect from a program which costs the nation approximately $3B per year. The
                        principal reason seems to us to be an inability to take full advantage of
                        technical opportunities available to us, which is directly traceable to
                        management policy which in effect gives excessive emphasis to quantity, to
                        the relative neglect of quality (technical performance, availability,
                        reliability, ease of maintenance, etc.) in force development. This is
                        reflected most clearly in a relative lack of <hi rend="italic">effective</hi> operational tests and evaluation of components and
                        systems, and hence in a lack of a realistic factual basis on which decisions
                        might be based. This is further reflected in a collection <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0412"/>of components that are not well matched, or
                        capabilities for individual components that are clearly out of phase. (The
                        mismatch between destroyer sonar detection ranges, fire control accuracy,
                        and weapon acquisition range is one example. Another is the lack of balance
                        between torpedo countermeasures capability, which is practically
                        nonexistent, and other characteristics of torpedoes such as range, lock-on
                        range, etc., which have been continually improved. Another is the lack of
                        balance between sonobuoy detection capability, which utilizes narrow band
                        spectral analysis (LOFAR) of low frequency line structures, but is not
                        directional, and correlation analysis using sonobuoy (CODAR) localization
                        which depends on broad band noise with average higher frequencies and hence
                        much greater attenuation. A final example is the great emphasis placed on
                        anti-submarine torpedoes and the relative lack of effort on anti-shipping or
                        anti-surface ship torpedoes.) These deficiencies will not be corrected by
                        further procurement of the present systems. Thus, the Panel does not endorse
                        several major components of the present <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        procurement program, and instead, concludes that a major effort should be
                        made to improve the quality of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        posture rather than increase the numbers of those components that are often
                        inadequate to their mission.<note n="5" xml:id="d124fn5">The Panel is aware
                            that current budgeting procedures result in <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> and procurement programs being considered quite
                            separately, but believes this to be unwise, especially for systems which
                            are not normally replaced over an interval of from 15 to 20 years.
                            [Footnote in the source text.]</note> An increase in the numbers of such
                        components over the next five years at the proposed rate means only a modest
                        increase in total numbers, but it is questionable whether this will
                        correspond to an equivalent increase in over-all effectiveness. However, the
                        institution of several major developmental programs over the next five years
                        is almost certain to lead to a very major improvement in our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> capabilities in the period five to fifteen
                        years from now, provided that these programs are well executed.</p>
                    <p>In adopting this conclusion, the Panel recognizes that over the next five
                        years major improvements in our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> posture
                        can come about only as the result of improving the presently-existing
                        components. In addition, the proposed developmental programs, if they are to
                        be properly executed, will require a major reorganization in the management

                    <p>In concluding that many of the proposed increases or replacements in present

                                reduce the effectiveness of allied ground forces, though the Panel
                                has not examined this point in detail. An increase in the number of

                                believes that the Chinese Communists could deploy in five years a

                                of nuclear weapons. While such a threat is not decisive, it does
                                provide China with a negotiating tool. The Panel believes that

                                is a definite threat to carrier task forces and to amphibious forces
                                in limited war situation. Such forces are vulnerable primarily

                                my opinion, inhibit performance within the Department of Defense of
                                its responsibilities and functions which significantly affect the

                                criterion, I have endeavored to identify and select those questions
                                to which intelligence is currently not able to supply a fully
                                satisfactory response and each of which is of such importance as to
                                represent either a significant area of strategic uncertainty in
                                force-oriented and strategic planning or a significantly inhibiting
                                factor in the conduct of military operations. In this process, I
                                have solicited the views of the major components of the Department
                                of Defense, including the commanders of the unified and specified

                                rather as a statement of those unanswered questions which, because
                                of their importance, currently assume an exceptional degree of
                                prominence within the Department of Defense. The items are not

                    <p>On June 17, 1964 the then Director of the Office of Emergency Planning in a
                        letter to you furnished information on the Supply-Requirements Study for
                        Nuclear War and Reconstruction<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">
                            <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref>.</note> being carried out by
                        various departments and agencies under guidance from this Office.</p>
                    <p>The initial aspect of this work dealt primarily with the development and
                        testing methods and techniques. We subsequently undertook a more definitive
                        study which could serve as the basis for reaching decisions about nuclear
                        war stockpile objectives.</p>
                    <p>This study has now been completed, and I am enclosing a set of documents
                        which describe it.<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Attached are a 15-page <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss> study, “Supply-Requirements Study for

                            printed.</note> The economic guidelines contained in the tables of the
                        enclosed material should now be used by your Department and other
                        participating departments and agencies carrying out the analyses of
                        individual materials needed to reach decisions about nuclear war stockpile
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p>A set of the documents is also being sent to Mr. <persName>Edmund

                        with a request that he review them prior to a meeting that we will have with
                        department and agency representatives later this month. Mr.
                            <persName>Getzin</persName> is your representative <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0420"/>on the Interagency Working Group on

                        resources and materials within their respective agencies.</p>
                    <p>The work on the analyses should advance as rapidly as possible. The schedule
                        for carrying it forward will be established at the meeting of the Working

                            Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to provide comments on an <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> paper, attachment to reference 1b,
                            which sets forth that agency’s tentative conclusions on policies which

                            weapons. The Deputy Director, <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>,
                            believes that, while the suggested policies are in the national
                            interest, there may be compelling military and political factors which
                            militate against their adoption.</item>

                    <p>Last year’s Memorandum to the President on Strategic Offensive and Defensive
                            Forces<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">
                            <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note> paid particular attention
                        to larger-than-expected threats to our Assured Destruction capability. These
                        threats were postulated without explicit study of their desirability or
                        feasibility from the Soviet viewpoint and without evidence of Soviet trends
                        in those directions from intelligence indicators. Postulation of such
                        threats furnishes an appropriate analytical tool for an extreme test of our
                        Assured Destruction capability; nevertheless there is a risk that it may
                        obscure possible U.S. opportunities to influence Soviet behavior. Taking
                        larger-than-expected threats as “given” fails to credit our Damage Limiting
                        forces with the virtual attrition that they in fact exact of the Soviets in
                        planning their own forces.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets apparently view our forces, as we do theirs, as a potential first
                        strike threat. They therefore must design their capabilities to protect
                        their own Assured Destruction capability against a U.S. first strike. To the
                        extent that Soviet resources are thus expended, and hence diverted from
                        alternative uses in improving the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>’s Damage Limiting posture, our own Assured Destruction
                        task becomes easier.</p>
                    <p>It is in our interest for the Soviets to spend sizable sums in guarding their
                        Assured Destruction capability, provided these expenditures are primarily
                        reflected in <hi rend="italic">defensive</hi> measures such as missile
                        launch facility hardening, missile dispersal or missile mobility, rather
                        than in increases in their offensive forces’ payloads. Diversion of Soviet
                        resources to defensive measures would reduce the cost of maintaining our
                        relative Assured Destruction position for a given level of Soviet
                        expenditure on strategic programs and would also contribute to U.S. and
                        Allied Damage Limiting by reducing their ability to inflict damage on
                        us.</p>
                    <p>The implications for U.S. policy concern the value of continuing to maintain
                        a counter-military threat against the Soviet strategic offensive <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0423"/>forces; specifically they concern the value
                        of achieving low <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> to force the Soviets to
                        adopt very expensive vulnerability-reducing methods such as mobility and
                        hard point defense. Although Soviet responses cannot be predicted with
                        confidence, a Soviet response that optimized their Assured Destruction
                        capability against a U.S. threat with much lower <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> than we have now, would result in a reduction in Soviet
                        first strike Damage Limiting capability over a wide range of Soviet Assured
                        Destruction budgets.</p>
                    <p>An illustration of the pressure imposed by U.S. strategic offensive forces on
                        Soviet forces was made in the <gloss target="#t_DDRE1">DDR&amp;E</gloss>
                        study, “A Summary Study on Strategic Offensive and Defensive Forces of the
                        U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>” of September 8,
                            1964.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">This 192-page study and Appendix are

                        Assured Destruction capability against a small U.S. counter-military
                        offensive capability they could purchase large, soft missiles at $1.33
                        million per kilopound ($M/<gloss target="#t_KP1">KP</gloss>). The cost to
                        the Soviets of the same payload triples—to $4M/<gloss target="#t_KP1">KP</gloss>—if survivability through hardening and dispersal must be
                        purchased. Virtual attrition seems to be exerting major influence on Soviet
                        force planning, as shown by the Soviets’ large scale deployment of SS–11s
                        and by their pursuit of small and mobile missile technology.</p>
                    <p>My staff has undertaken a further analysis of the pressures that programmed
                        U.S. forces indirectly bring to bear on the Soviet Damage Limiting
                        capability. This analysis proceeds in three steps.</p>
                    <p>In the first step, a Soviet force is designed to negate the U.S. Assured
                        Destruction capability in a Soviet first strike assuming that the Soviets
                        were not in fact concerned with maintaining an effective Assured Destruction
                        capability. It is basically the approach used in the extreme cases of last
                        year’s Draft Presidential Memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Then, the programmed U.S. forces are applied against this Soviet posture, and
                        surviving Soviet forces strike U.S. urban targets. Resulting U.S. fatalities
                        are so low that the assumed enemy posture could not constitute a
                        high-confidence (to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss>) Soviet
                        Assured Destruction capability.</p>
                    <p>Finally, at the same Soviet budget level used in the first step, a new Soviet
                        force is designed for first strike Damage Limiting, subject to a constraint
                        on Soviet second strike Assured Destruction stemming from the pressure
                        exerted by our capabilities. This constraint markedly reduced the Soviets’
                        ability to erode our Assured Destruction capability within the fixed Soviet
                        budget level.</p>

                        re-examination of SS–9 requirements, taking all reliabilities into account,
                        indicates that the Soviets would need some 350 SS–9s, each carrying 10 Mk-17
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>’s, to achieve high expected damage
                        against programmed U.S. land-based forces with high confidence. Assuming the
                        existence of such a Soviet capability, and applying reasonable adjustments
                        to National Intelligence Projections for Planning (<gloss target="#t_NIPP1">NIPP</gloss>) factors to reflect the assumed introduction of <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>, the expected damage against U.S. forces
                        is .92 with a 1500 foot SS–9 <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>, but only
                        .77 with a 2100 foot <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>. (We now project a
                            <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> of 3000 feet for the SS–9 in 1970,
                        with no evidence of an appreciable Soviet effort to reduce this figure.)
                        These missiles alone cost some $9 billion (about $1.5 M/<gloss target="#t_KP1">KP</gloss>) beyond the cost of the remainder of Soviet
                        Offensive forces.</p>
                    <p>Next, we design a least-cost Soviet defense to keep Soviet fatalities at [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] of
                        their total population in the face of a counter-urban attack by the
                        surviving U.S. forces. This fatality level corresponds to the delivery of
                            [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                        declassified</hi>] warheads in the absence of Soviet defenses, and roughly
                        equates to the level that might be expected from leakage through a very good
                        defense against a U.S. retaliatory attack. This defense consists of 1800
                        area interceptors and 1000 terminal interceptors at 15 cities, at a total
                        five-year cost of approximately $6.4 billion plus a non-recurring cost for
                        research and development, tooling and production facilities, etc., which is
                        irrelevant to this calculation. Of this cost, approximately 80 percent is
                        for area defenses. This is consistent with results obtained in analyses of
                        light Nike-X deployments.</p>
                    <p>Thus, for a total increment of some $15 billion over a base <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> budget, the Soviets can reduce the
                        Assured Destruction capability of our programmed missile forces to a highly
                        unsatisfactory level through 1969–1974. The base budget is the cost of their
                            <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> program, their missile programs,
                        their <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss> programs, their bomber program
                        and their air defense programs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Assured Destruction Capability of the Soviet Force</hi>.
                        We have analyzed a pre-emptive U.S. strike as a Soviet planner might do, in
                        evaluating the Soviet Assured Destruction capability. The programmed U.S.
                        forces are laid down in a pre-emptive strike against the Soviet
                        intercontinental strategic military target system designed above (i.e., the
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed SS–9s plus the other Soviet
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss> bases, intercontinental bomber bases, etc.). If the Soviet
                        area defenses did not cover their SS–9 missile fields, as would be the case
                        with the present locations of the SS–9 silos, U.S. fatalities would be less
                        than 10%. If the Soviet area missile defense is assumed to protect Soviet
                        military targets and to operate without <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0425"/>leakage residual Soviet forces are estimated to inflict 22%
                        U.S. fatalities (200 equivalent one <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>
                        weapons) in the absence of U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. Thus
                        the Soviet deterrent would depend entirely on the precise siting and
                        effectiveness of their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> as a component of
                        hard point defense. (Even a very light U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment would be able to negate the remaining Soviet
                        forces.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Soviet First Strike Damage Limiting with Assured
                            Destruction Constraint</hi>. As a last step, the Soviets take measures
                        to maintain their Assured Destruction capability. They are allowed to
                        replace the forces assumed above with more survivable forces at the same
                        cost as the Soviet Damage Limiting force. The resulting posture (shown in
                        table below is very similar to the missile force predicted in the <gloss target="#t_NIPP1">NIPP</gloss>), but the SS–9s are assumed to carry
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s. Additional mobile missiles and
                        an area only defense are also purchased at the expense of Soviet terminal
                        defenses. The SS–9s and the area defenses can be considered as the Damage
                        Limiting increment added to the Assured Destruction backbone of their
                        posture.</p>
                    <p>If this <hi rend="italic">entire force</hi> is sent against the U.S. in a
                        Damage Limiting first strike (i.e., no part is withheld for a later Assured
                        Destruction capability), the residual U.S. missile forces can still deliver
                        more than [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        Again, this figure exceeds the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source

                    </p>
                    <p>The Soviets, by viewing our forces as a first strike threat to their Assured
                        Destruction capability, must spend much more to achieve a first strike
                        Damage Limiting capability. This does not argue that the Soviets are
                        incapable of achieving both a satisfactory (to them) Assured Destruction
                        capability and a Damage Limiting capability. But it does mean that, by
                        carefully designing our own forces, we can foreclose any “easy” roads to
                        Damage Limiting for the Soviets. Furthermore, low U.S. <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>s prevent simple proliferation of hard
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> silos from being a useful Soviet
                        response; Soviet mobility or defense would be required. Thus, a simple
                        increase in total Soviet offensive payload is not a likely response to the
                        strong U.S. counterforce capability.</p>
                    <p>Characteristics of U.S. Damage Limiting forces that place this constraint on
                        Soviet forces should, therefore, receive continued attention. For example,
                        the high accuracy attainable with the Mk-17 (rather than the Mk-11A) can be
                        thought of as making an indirect contribution to Assured Destruction.</p>
                    <p>Proposed changes in U.S. forces (such as the addition of large payload
                        missiles) should be evaluated in light of possible Soviet responses, and
                        especially in light of the constraints they impose on the Soviet mix of
                        Assured Destruction and Damage Limiting. Analyses not based on such
                        consideration are likely to be incomplete, and the decisions based on such
                        incomplete analyses, misleading.</p>
                    <p>In this year’s Presidential Memorandum, I propose to include an interaction
                        analysis. Thus, in addition to postulating Soviet threats and finding what
                        forces would be required to overcome them, various possible new U.S.
                        systems—both for Assured Destruction hedges or for Damage Limiting—will be
                        considered in terms of the effects they would be likely to have on the

                    <p>The President and the Vice President met with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff on Friday, May 27, largely to get acquainted. The
                        President began the meeting by outlining his philosophy of our foreign
                        policy. He made these points: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>We have to stay strong militarily, not because we want to use
                                force but just because we have now learned that force is sometimes
                                necessary to keep peace. “My father used to tell me that love would
                                solve 95% of the world’s problems but that you had to be strong to
                                solve the other 5% because some people do not understand the
                                language of love and friendship.” Later in the meeting he came back
                                to this theme. Thinking about the $60 billion defense budget, he
                                said “Think what wonders I could perform with that money if I could
                                put it into agriculture and health and education.”</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>This strength is not to set up a fortress America. In this world
                                which is now 3 billion people and will be 6 billion in not too long
                                a time, we just can’t survive by keeping to ourselves. So in our own
                                interests we have to worry about the other fellow.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>More than that we can’t rest while other people are miserable in
                                such numbers. “They are human beings just like we are. They laugh
                                like we do. They cry like we do when they are hurt. They eat like we
                                do, although not so well. They need clothes and shelter like we do.”
                                So a nation blessed with the riches ours has can not sit back while
                                others like ourselves are in misery.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Vice President spoke generally on the same theme of circulating the
                        ideals of the Great Society into a world wide effort against poverty,
                        disease, and illiteracy.</p>
                    <p>The President picked up one of the Vice President’s remarks and said he
                        wanted to make very clear his position on Vietnam. He said he obviously was
                        under all kinds of pressure to “get out with General
                            <persName>Fulbright</persName>, go in with General
                            <persName>Goldwater</persName>, and General <persName>Gavin</persName>
                        wants me to ‘hunker up like a jackass in a hailstorm’.” He said he had
                        looked at all the choices. He didn’t see how any President of the United
                        States could do other than what he has chosen to do. He admits he could be
                        wrong. But having decided on this course, he is absolutely determined to see
                        it through. No one should be under any illusion that we will be pulling
                        out.</p>

                    <p>The President said he was very happy with the memos, analyses, and
                        recommendations coming from the staff. What he would like to see more of now
                        is “ten new ideas” in his reading folder every night. He said these were
                        beginning to flow but he wanted more and more of them.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Bromley Smith</persName> asked that I prepare a
                        note for you commenting on the attached report which summarizes the current
                        status of our knowledge of the anti-missile defense system in the Moscow
                        area since he felt it might have considerable impact on our own military
                        planning.</p>
                    <p>This is not a new development. Information on this system has been
                        accumulating for several years. There has been agreement in the intelligence
                        community for over a year and a half that it was almost certainly intended
                        for some sort of anti-ballistic missile defense and that it was probably
                        based on the use of relatively high-yield weapons for exoatmospheric
                        defense. The principal new piece of information reported in the memorandum
                        is that the Soviets are now beginning to construct missile launchers,
                        probably for the Galosh missile, at several of the radar sites associated
                        with this system. This move had been anticipated for several months since
                        launchers were observed under construction at the prototype installation at
                        the Sary Shagan anti-missile development center.</p>
                    <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>
                    <p>The central question is how effective the Moscow ballistic missile defense
                        would be against US strategic missiles in the late 1960s and early 1970s
                        when it would presumably be fully operational. While it is impossible to
                        give a precise answer to this question since we can only guess how the
                        Moscow system would operate, I think it is possible to make some significant
                        general observations on the system’s capabilities that indicate quite
                        persuasively that by itself the Moscow system would not be particularly
                        effective even in the defense of Moscow and would have only a small
                        perturbation on our over-all war plans.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Physical Vulnerability</hi>. The Moscow system is
                            extremely soft and hence highly vulnerable to a well-planned large-scale
                            attack. It appears to depend for early warning and initial tracking on
                            the Hen House radars located at Olenegorsk in northern Murmansk and
                            Skrunda on the Baltic coast. Both of these radars are very soft and
                            essentially undefended. The large Dog House radar at Moscow, which may
                            be back-up early warning and tracking radars for the system, and the
                            radars at the triads which probably do the final tracking of the
                            incoming missile and the tracking of the defensive missiles are also
                            extremely soft. Finally, the defensive missiles will fire from exposed
                            above-ground launchers.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Penetrability</hi>. By the 1969–70 period our
                            programmed penetration aids for Minuteman-Polaris will probably be very
                            effective against a Moscow-type system (high altitude intercept). By
                            dispensing chaff and decoys, each missile will present the defense with
                            some 7 to 21 separate re-entering targets even when very high-yield
                            warheads are employed. Hence, a very small number of our offensive
                            missiles would probably overwhelm the system.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>

                            <hi rend="italic">Fire Power</hi>. The Moscow system will not have a
                            high rate of fire. So far, we see only some 64 missile launchers under
                            construction. When the entire projected deployment of 8 double triads is
                            completed (some of this is not yet really started), the total system
                            would consist of only 128 launchers. This is very small compared to the
                            requirements of a really effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            system and the Soviet threats <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has hypothesized in his US force level
                            projections. For example, in his Memorandum for the President in
                            connection with the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1967 budget for
                            strategic offensive-defensive forces,<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">For a
                                draft, see <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> examined a
                            worst-possible Soviet threat in the early 70’s in connection with the
                            decision to initiate deployment of the Poseidon missile to increase the
                            fire power of the Polaris submarine fleet. In this analysis he assumed
                            that the Soviets put <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (multiple
                            independent re-entry vehicles) on enough of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force to completely eliminate our
                            Minuteman force in a pre-emptive strike. (I would note that there is no
                            evidence that the Soviets have <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0430"/>done anything leading towards a <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>
                            capability.) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also
                            assumed that our penetration aids programs would all fail
                            catastrophically and that aircraft would be unable to inflict any damage
                            on the Soviet Union because of <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            defenses. He then assumed that the Soviets would deploy 4,500
                            exoatmospheric <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> interceptors which
                            could effectively engage 3,000 separate incoming targets. Even in the
                            face of this concatenation of extreme threat assumptions, he concluded
                            that with the added fire power of Poseidon we would still be able to
                            approximate the amount of damage required to meet his criteria of
                            assured destruction.</item>

                    <p>Although it is not discussed in the attached document, the big area of
                        disagreement about Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities
                        in the intelligence community is over the functional identity of the
                        so-called Leningrad-Tallinn system which has been suspected, particularly by
                            <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>, as being a possible <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. This system is now being deployed
                        at a number of locations from the Baltic to the Urals. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is now almost certain that this system is
                        in reality a long-range air defense system to supplement or replace the SA–2
                        system. <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> is now in the process of
                        reevaluating their position on this system. I agree with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In summary, there is nothing particularly new in the attached report.
                        Although we are beginning to accumulate details that may indicate how the
                        Soviet system actually works, we are fundamentally in the same position
                        concerning Soviet capabilities and intentions in this area that we have been
                        in for the last year or two. There is no question that the Soviets are
                        interested in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s and are undertaking at
                        least a limited deployment at Moscow. We have not, however, seen real
                        evidence of a massive national deployment or of a really effective system at
                        Moscow by the standards we are now considering.</p>
                    <p>In line with <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Bromley</persName>’s concern, I
                        believe that this information will not have any special impact on the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> since they have already assumed much worse
                        threats in their military planning. I also do not believe the information on
                        the Moscow system will have any special impact on Congress since <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has already briefed the Congress
                        on an estimated Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> threat that is,
                        if anything, more extensive than the current facts indicate. (See attached
                        extract from <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s classified

                        <item>There has been no basic change in established Soviet military doctrine
                            or force structure, but recent trends point to adjustments in Soviet
                            defense policy. The present political leaders seem more attentive than
                            was Khrushchev to professional military advice, and they have been
                            willing to authorize increases in both defense expenditures and military
                            manpower. Current military writings reveal a search for ways to broaden
                            the options available to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in
                            the application of its military power. (Paras. l-5)</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets retain their belief in the primacy of strategic attack and
                            defense forces, both for deterrence and for foreign policy support. <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0433"/>In addition, however, they now
                            show increasing interest in improving the capabilities of their general
                            purpose forces to meet contingencies short of general nuclear war. We
                            believe this interest is in part responsive to past developments in US
                            and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> capabilities and to US
                            advocacy of flexible response. Additional factors include the tensions
                            arising from the Vietnam war and the resulting US military buildup, as
                            well as Chinese hostility towards the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. (Paras. 6, 7, 12–14)</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>A sharp increase in Soviet defense expenditures is evidently to occur
                            this year. We attribute it primarily to planned expansion in military R
                            and D and to the cost of long lead-time deployment programs for
                            strategic systems which were authorized in previous years. It probably
                            also stems in part from some recent increase in operating costs,
                            including military manpower. The Soviet leaders have probably authorized
                            further growth in military and space expenditures during the 1966–1970
                            Five Year Plan period. We believe, however, that in the interests of
                            their ambitious economic programs they will seek to limit the growth in
                            defense spending to no more than the average rate of growth in GNP.
                            (Paras. 3, 4, 17–22)</item>

                        <item>
                            <p>The Soviet leaders probably expect to achieve a substantial
                                improvement in their strategic position vis-à-vis the US during the
                                next several years. Chief among their current strategic attack
                                programs is the rapid deployment of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s in dispersed and hardened silos, which will add
                                substantially to the survivability and retaliatory capability of the
                                force. Major current air and missile defense programs include
                                improved means of warning and control, better defenses against
                                aircraft and aerodynamic missiles, and what we believe to be <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses under construction.
                                Through these and other programs, we think the Soviets are working
                                to alleviate their present strategic inferiority, and to gain
                                greater assurance of deterring the US in the various crises and
                                confrontations they must allow for as they contemplate possible
                                developments in the world situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Colonel <persName>Harry O. Patteson</persName>, for the

                            <p>The intensity with which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                                pursuing a massive military research and development program—the
                                specific content and progress of which are not clearly known to the
                                US—could portend far more than an intent merely to strengthen Soviet
                                deterrent posture and could well be aimed at attainment of a
                                strategic military position which the US would recognize as
                                providing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> with a credible
                                first strike damage limiting capability as well as an assured

                        <item>The past restructuring of Soviet theater forces for general nuclear
                            war has resulted in certain characteristics which could be serious
                            handicaps in non-nuclear warfare, particularly if at all prolonged. We
                            estimate that the Soviets will undertake gradual improvements in their
                            general purpose forces which will make them somewhat better suited <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0434"/>than at present for
                            conventional operations. Ground units will probably be provided with
                            greater tactical mobility and improved combat and logistic support,
                            becoming more quickly responsive and better able to engage in sustained
                            combat. The Soviets will also maintain a large and versatile tactical
                            air component. They will continue to expand their naval presence in the
                            open oceans, and will acquire greater capabilities to move unopposed
                            military forces to distant areas. The Soviets may regard improved
                            general purpose forces as having increased relevance as their strategic
                            capabilities grow, but we do not think they expect alterations in the
                            strategic situation so great as to permit them to undertake
                            substantially more aggressive courses of action.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">Colonel <persName>Harry O. Patteson</persName>, for
                                the Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, believes the Soviet longer term goal is a
                                combination of capabilities which would yield a credible first
                                strike capability against US forces and thus permit substantially
                                more aggressive courses of action. [Footnote in the source

                        <item>Soviet military policy will continue to be heavily influenced by
                            external developments. In recent years Soviet forces in the Sino-Soviet
                            border area have been strengthened in minor ways, and we expect a
                            gradual increase in Soviet military strength confronting China. In
                            Eastern Europe the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> continues to
                            develop the forces of its Warsaw Pact allies, despite their increasing
                            tendency to assert their independence. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is thus far disposed toward caution with respect to
                            the present weakening of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, perhaps
                            because of concern over the possible loosening of constraints on a
                            revival of independent German power. But the Soviets weigh the adequacy
                            of their military programs primarily against US capabilities, and they
                            will continue to be sensitive to major new developments in US military
                            policy and forces. (Paras. 8–11, 14)</item>

                        <item>Within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, a high level of
                            effort in military R and D will almost certainly be continued, despite
                            resource allocation problems. The Soviets probably regard such an effort
                            as imperative in order to prevent the US from gaining a technological
                            advantage and also to gain, if possible, some advantage for themselves,
                            but in deciding to deploy any new weapon system they would have to weigh
                            the prospective gain against the economic costs and the capabilities of
                            the US to counter it. (Paras. 15, 23)</item>

                        <item>We do not expect that Soviet military forces will come to be
                            structured according to some quite new and clear-cut strategic doctrine.
                            This will almost certainly be prevented by such factors as the momentum
                            of existing programs, the multiplicity of claims on resources, and the
                            differing views of various groups as to priorities. (Para. 5)</item>

                        recommending approval. It is not clear whether the President or Joe Califano
                        looked at it, but we were requested to return the package to the Pentagon to
                        get Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s signature
                        on it and also to obtain the formal concurrence of the Joint Chiefs. This

                    <p>I have no doubt, and the <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> staff agrees,

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The stockpile proposal was first submitted to you last January and it
                            was returned to Defense to obtain formal <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> concurrence (although the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had previously concurred informally in the proposal).
                            The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> looked again at certain of the
                            figures and some minor changes have resulted in the new submittal,
                            largely resulting from a decision to stretch out the retirement of
                            certain tactical and strategic bombs that are becoming obsolete and the
                            retirement of the Nike Hercules warheads.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>An important aspect of the new proposal is that the approved <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 stockpile figure is being reduced
                            from [<hi rend="italic">numbers not declassified</hi>]—a reduction of
                                [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. The proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 stockpile will be further
                            reduced [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] to a total of
                                [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]. Thus, the current
                            proposal will cause a net reduction of [<hi rend="italic">number not
                                declassified</hi>] from the currently authorized stockpile total—or
                            a reduction of nearly [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>]
                            from the total you approved in April 1965. The reduction of megatonnage
                            of yield would be proportionately larger because a large number of high
                            yield weapons are being retired. At the same time, however, we are
                            getting a more modern stockpile better tailored to specified military
                            missions.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The recommended stockpile is within the projected availability of
                            special nuclear materials, and the number of new weapons is within
                                <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> capability to produce. There are
                            potential plutonium requirements in the possible deployment of the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Poseidon/Minuteman warheads which, if approved,
                            would substantially increase plutonium and weapons fabrication
                            requirements in future years. On the basis of present estimates,
                            however, there will be enough plutonium available by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 to meet the <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> Defense special nuclear requirements through 1974, not
                            including the above possible additional requirements.</item>

                        <item>The Bureau of the Budget has reviewed this proposal. <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> believes that some obsolete weapons
                            should be retired on a faster schedule than is now being proposed. It
                            does not recommend that you disapprove this stockpile action, but <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> will make this a budget issue for
                            discussion with Defense this Fall. There is no immediate major cost
                            impact from maintaining the approximately [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] in the inventory in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968. The important thing will be
                            to make sure that the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] do not become a part of the permanent base
                            that is used for estimating requirements.</item>

                    <p>I approve the proposed Nuclear Weapons Stockpile for the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 submitted to me by the Department of
                        Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission on June 6, 1966.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">See <ref target="#d133fn3">footnote 3, Document

                    <p>Accordingly, I approve a total of [<hi rend="italic">number not

                        composition for the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968. I also
                        approve a total of [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] complete

                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. This will mean a planned
                        production by the Atomic Energy Commission of [<hi rend="italic">number not

                        elements during <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968, resulting in a net

                    <p>I have directed the Atomic Energy Commission to produce and retire those

                        and maintain the approved <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 stockpile.
                        I have also directed the production of the additional weapons required for

                    <p>I authorize you, in coordination with the Atomic Energy Commission, to make
                        such changes in the total stockpile not to exceed ±10% of the specifically

                        in strategic, tactical, air defense or anti-submarine warfare warhead totals
                        that may be required because of adjusted delivery assets or changes in

                        defense capability is assumed. On the other hand, if the Soviets are assumed
                        to have the capability to operate these forces in a coordinated manner,
                        using “preferential” defense of some locations at the expense of others and
                        to operate some of their long range interceptors in a precommitted “loiter”

                    <p>As indicated in the Introduction and Threat discussions in the report, the
                        study results are strongly influenced by the Threat projection, about which
                        there remains considerable uncertainty. These uncertainties involve
                        questions as to: 1) which of the two systems that the Soviets are building
                        that can have <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability will be
                        proliferated as the main <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> component; 2)
                        what the rate of interceptor build-up will be; 3) what mode of defense (as
                        discussed above) their interceptors will operate in; 4) how effective their
                        first strike on U.S. Missile Forces will be (including the possibility of
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> or Terminally Guided Reentry
                        Vehicle), and 5) the success of the U.S. in continuing to have accurate
                        intelligence on interceptor deployment.</p>
                    <p>The study results, in general, are U.S. conservative in that the choice of
                        assumptions regarding the reference case <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment rate, the lack of defense command and control constraints, the
                        Soviet Offense effectiveness, and the effects of simplifications needed to
                        model the engagements for computation all tend to provide an upper bound to
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> effectiveness. Alternatively,
                        changes in certain key assumptions could reduce the level of Soviet<note n="7" xml:id="d137fn7">

                        circumstances. These assumptions are 1) that the U.S. penetration aids will
                        be effective in drawing interceptors; 2) that the Soviets do not have mobile
                        interceptors about which we are unaware and that we will continue to obtain
                        intelligence regarding their fixed sites and 3) that the U.S. will develop

                        be reduced.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. does not presently have in its inventory any missile payloads that
                        individually “penetrate” Soviet Defenses. Our “penetration aids” are in

                        while U.S. defense design has had to worry in detail about these tactics,
                        the offense has not yet been able to plan to use them with confidence. As

                        and as we begin to get sufficient intelligence about their systems to probe
                        for weak spots, such “penetration” tactics will probably become available
                        with confidence and be cheaper to apply than is the exhaustion tactic. These

                        under emergency conditions, including nuclear war (see Document 44), the
                        White House Office of Emergency Planning (<gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss>) placed more emphasis on the study of emergency conditions
                        in a limited war situation. In May 1966 a draft of a Resource Mobilization
                        Plan for Limited War was completed and submitted to the Department of
                        Defense and other government agencies for review and comment. As summarized
                        in a May 20 letter from <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss> Director
                            <persName corresp="#p_BF5">Farris Bryant</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the Plan, among other things,
                        “provides for an Office of Defense Resources, including the organizational
                        and staffing arrangements, together with general operating procedures and
                        emergency actions which would be put into effect upon the activation of
                            <gloss target="#t_ODR1">ODR</gloss> by the President.” It also
                        “recognizes the role of private industry in any mobilization effort,
                        realizes the need for flexibility to meet the demands of a situation which
                        are not precisely predictable, and places a heavy burden on the Federal

                        for the development of civil emergency preparedness measures, however,

                    </p>
                    <p>Our strategic nuclear forces should deter attack on the U.S. and its Allies
                        and, if deterrence fails, limit damage to our society and those of our
                        Allies. To accomplish these objectives, we design our forces around two
                        related concepts; Assured Destruction—that is, the clear and unmistakable
                        ability to destroy the societies of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and/or the Chinese People’s Republic (<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>) even after a surprise attack; and Damage
                        Limiting, which entails the ability to reduce by both offensive and
                        defensive means the damage an enemy can inflict on the U.S. and its
                        Allies.</p>
                    <p>Deterrence must work over a range of situations. It must prevent not only a
                        massive surprise attack, but also Soviet escalation to general nuclear war
                        from local war. The Assured Destruction capability is designed to deter a
                        potential aggressor, even in crisis situations when the alternatives to
                        initiating nuclear war might otherwise lead him to go to war.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets seem to view our forces, as we do theirs, as a potential first
                        strike threat. The recent deployment of the new, relatively small SS–11

                        and Soviet interest in small and mobile missile technology reflect their
                        concern to protect their <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0447"/>strategic
                        offensive forces against a U.S. first strike. Our force structure planning
                        should take account of the interactions implied by their interest in having
                        a protected retaliatory force.</p>
                    <p>Three broadly different posture alternatives are available. First, we could
                        seek only an Assured Destruction capability (although we would in any case
                        achieve a substantial Damage-Limiting capability in the process of building
                        an Assured Destruction capability). Second, we might add a light Damage
                        Limiting increment that would give some protection against probable types of
                        Soviet attacks, and more complete protection against small attacks that the
                            <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> may be able to mount in the 1970s.
                        Third, we might try to add a major Damage Limiting capability to keep U.S.
                        fatalities very low against the heaviest possible Soviet attack, and
                        regardless of Soviet force structure responses.</p>
                    <p>Plainly, we must and will maintain whatever forces are needed to meet the
                        Assured Destruction objective, while keeping flexibility to meet
                        unpredictable changes in the threat. Under the second option, we would
                        choose Damage Limiting programs that insure against the failure of
                        deterrence under many, but not all, circumstances. The third alternative is
                        certain to be very expensive. Moreover, because its rigid objective is
                        probably infeasible, I reject this option.</p>

                    <p>The Soviets are building at least two types of single silo launch sites, a
                        large one that we expect to hold the large payload (9,000–12,500 pound)
                        storable liquid fueled SS–9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system,
                        operational in limited numbers in 1966, and a small one probably intended
                        for the SS–11, a small payload (1,000–2,000 pound) storable liquid fueled
                        missile, also operational in 1966.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have recently increased the rate of deployment of the SS–11
                        missile launchers to a level about 20 percent above their previous maximum.
                        As a result I estimate that they will have between 600 and 700 operational
                        launchers in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>68 instead of the 514–582
                        estimated in <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–65, with the increase
                        consisting of SS–11 missiles.</p>
                    <p>We have not yet observed any evidence of Soviet Multiple Independent Re-entry

                        the re-entry technology required for highly accurate missiles. We might not
                        see such programs, however, until about three years before their deployment
                        in significant force.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the offensive forces shown, two relatively large-scale Soviet
                        defensive programs appear to be underway: a probable long range anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system around Moscow (16–32 launchers
                        expected to be operational in 1967 or 1968); and a system near Leningrad and
                        across European <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intended for either
                        ballistic missile defenses, long range surface-to-air bomber defenses, or
                        some combination of the two. Soviet defense priorities, as we assess them,
                        suggest a probable emphasis on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. As an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, however, the technology of the
                        Leningrad system appears to be much closer to some of the early systems
                        considered by the U.S. than to Nike-X, except perhaps for the use of an
                        X-ray kill warhead above the atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> also has one “G” class ballistic

                        primarily as a threat to Asian targets. As a force to retaliate for a U.S.
                        strike against the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, however, this system
                        is vulnerable, since the “G” class boat’s long transit time to the U.S.
                        (40–45 days) would allow our Naval forces to destroy the submarine (or
                        submarines) in the early 1970s.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> also has almost 300 bombers capable
                        of delivering nuclear weapons against Asian targets. But only 15 of these
                        have ranges beyond 600 miles, and the Chinese are unlikely to undertake the
                        costly development of a long range bomber to attack <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>.</p>

                    <p>More extreme threats are possible, but they are so unlikely, given the state
                        of Soviet technology and the high cost to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of mounting such forces, that they do not warrant taking
                        now any actions in addition to those included in the recommended U.S. force.
                        I will, however, discuss below some available hedging actions for our
                        missile force. In any case, even against the most extreme threat, the
                        combined Assured Destruction capability of the Recommended U.S. Missile
                        Force and the Programmed Bomber Force is clearly adequate, and would amount
                        to [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        fatalities.</p>
                    <p>Our offensive forces make it dangerous and expensive for the Soviets to move
                        in the direction of extreme threats to our Assured Destruction capability.
                        The incremental 5 year cost to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> of
                        the depicted SS–9 and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> threats would be
                        about $30 billion, approximately a forty percent increase in the present
                        Soviet expenditure rate on strategic forces. Yet, evaluating the Soviet
                        Assured Destruction capability with extreme conservatism, as a Soviet
                        planner might do, this Soviet missile force with only these SS–9s, <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s, and the older missiles would inflict
                        less than 10% <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0452"/>fatalities on the
                        U.S. after a pre-emptive strike by programmed U.S. forces. If this was an
                        unsatisfactory Assured Destruction capability for the Soviets and they
                        reoriented their planning at the same budget level to maintain Assured
                        Destruction, they would have to reduce their spending on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>.
                        The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would have to reduce vulnerability
                        to the very accurate programmed U.S. offensive forces, by expensive measures
                        such as further dispersal of missile payload (the SS–11 deployment appears
                        to be the beginning of this), by hard point defenses (<gloss target="#t_HPD1">HPD</gloss>), or by adoption of mobile missile basing
                        schemes thereby reducing the total Soviet missile payload that would
                        otherwise be available at a given budget level. The reduction in Soviet
                        missile payload, in turn would make the U.S. Assured Destruction task less
                        expensive or, alternatively, the development of higher-than-expected threats
                        even less likely.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the Soviets could increase their strategic budget. But we can, in
                        planning our forces, foreclose any seemingly “easy” and cheap paths to their
                        achievement of a satisfactory Assured Destruction capability and a
                        satisfactory Damage Limiting capability at the same time.</p>

                                fleet defense for protection. The vulnerability of this system is,
                                of course, the principal reservation. Long lead time funding of some

                    <p>Strategic bombers might be called on in the future to support conventional
                        operations on a much wider scale than they are doing now in Southeast Asia.
                        Moreover, the Assured Destruction capability of our strategic missile force
                        will almost certainly deter the Soviets from a surprise attack except,
                        perhaps, in an extreme crisis or an escalating war. In these cases we would
                        have received sufficient warning to put the strategic bomber force on high
                        alert. Our bombers should therefore be primarily designed for such

                    <p>Reductions in manned aircraft operating expenses would be consistent with
                        this view of the bombers role. A 43% alert rate, down from 53%, will be
                        sustainable with the recommended new 1.5 crew ratio. At this rate, our alert
                        bombers could deliver more than [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                        against a future sea-launched missile threat. In general, B–52s should have
                        the ability to disperse in times of crisis and be distributed with 30 per
                        home base where economies will result. By May 1967, the Air Force will have
                        completed a basing study to determine the feasibility of these basing
                        concepts.</p>
                    <p>Such operating adjustments will provide a large enough surviving bomber fleet
                        to meet the entire Assured Destruction payload requirement, will save
                        $200–400 million annually, and will probably make it possible to extend the

                        modification. This will allow an added margin of safety in the timing of

                        nuclear war with the Soviets is unlikely. Of the ways in which one might
                        start, a surprise attack in normal times is especially unlikely; it would be
                        much more likely to arise from a crisis or limited war, giving both sides
                        enough strategic warning to increase their alert status. The Soviets might
                        start a nuclear war for fear of a pre-emptive strike by the U.S., as part of
                        a massive attack on Western Europe, or to prevent the loss of a limited war.
                        In each case, the Soviets could be expected to try to preserve as much as
                        possible of Soviet society and military power. Thus, they might devote a
                        large part of their strategic offensive forces to reducing the U.S.

                    <p>Two factors tend to decrease U.S. fatalities between 1971 and 1976: the
                        gradual decline in the Soviet bomber threat, and improved U.S.
                        counter-military capabilities. Without programmed U.S. defenses, however,
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s damage potential could be over
                        100 million (50%) U.S. fatalities in a mixed Soviet attack.</p>
                    <p>We have also analyzed the effects if the U.S. initiated either of two
                        balanced Damage Limiting programs, assuming at this point that we evoked no
                        response from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> except for provision
                        of penetration aids for projected Soviet missiles. (Soviet responses are
                        considered below.) Posture A includes Nike-X with a limited Sprint defense
                        at 25 <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0456"/>cities, an improved bomber
                        defense using F–111s, and expanded civil defense. Posture B includes a heavy
                        Sprint defense of 52 cities. Incremental expenditures for these postures,
                        measured from the Approved Program as a base, are shown in the following

                        insurance against a higher-than-expected Soviet threat, I believe that we
                        should ultimately convert 31 Polaris submarines to Poseidon. A fleet of 31
                        Poseidon boats will have [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] of a fleet of 41 Polaris A–3 boats. Only an
                        unexpectedly serious Soviet <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> threat that
                        would require dispersal of our forces on a larger number of <gloss target="#t_SSBN1">SSBN</gloss>s could change this. Disposition of the
                        last 10 submarines, which cannot economically be converted to Poseidon, need
                        not be decided now. We are studying the option to deploy new Poseidon
                        submarines after the last conversion of the 31 now planned.</p>
                    <p>We plan on an operational availability date (<gloss target="#t_OAD1">OAD</gloss>) in 1970 for the Poseidon missile carrying Mark-3 re-entry
                        systems. Possible Mark-3/Mark-17 mixes will be re-evaluated yearly as new
                        estimates of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> are made and a

                        becomes operational, there will already be 600 Minuteman IIs in the force.
                        Rather than replace these with Minuteman IIIs prior to the completion of the
                        Force Modernization Program in early 1972, we will take as a tentative

                        <hi rend="italic">Deployment of a New Manned Interceptor</hi>. The Soviets
                        would probably use their bombers primarily in attacks on urban areas rather
                        than on time-urgent military targets, since the time to reach target is so
                        much longer for bombers than for ballistic missiles. Therefore, air defense
                        is an important component of a Damage Limiting posture. The F–12 and F–111
                        interceptors, equipped with the improved ASG–18/AIM–47 fire control and
                        missile systems, and used with an effective Airborne Warning and Control
                        System (<gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss>), would be better than the
                        present force in operating from degraded bases, countering concentrated
                        bomber attacks, operating independently of a vulnerable fixed <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0460"/>ground environment, and dealing with
                        bombers attacking at low-altitude or carrying air-to-surface missiles.</p>
                    <p>With strategic warning we estimate that 32 <gloss target="#t_UE1">UE</gloss>
                        F–12s or 48 <gloss target="#t_UE1">UE</gloss> stretched F–111As could
                        achieve the same number kills before weapons release as the current force
                        which has a 10 year cost of $3.0 billion. The 10 year systems cost for the
                        32 <gloss target="#t_UE1">UE</gloss> F–12 force have increased from the
                        previously estimated $1.9 billion to $2.9 billion. Estimates for the F–111
                        force remain at $1.5 billion. The F–111 force therefore appears
                        substantially more efficient than the F–12s against the currently projected
                        threat. Supplementary calculations indicate that it is comparable in
                        efficiency to the F–12 force against possible future threats.</p>
                    <p>The 48 <gloss target="#t_UE1">UE</gloss> F–111 force would operate from 4
                        main bases, 8 dispersal bases and 30 recovery/recycle bases. Sixteen combat
                        support aircraft, that would be flushed with the interceptors, would carry
                        missiles, ground support equipment, spares, and personnel to support the
                        F–111 turn-around at the recycle bases. With 42 <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> aircraft to provide airborne control, we could reduce the
                        present ground environment, retaining only enough radars and <gloss target="#t_BUIC1">BUIC</gloss> centers for peacetime control.</p>
                    <p>The investment costs for this force include $676 million for the F–111 and
                        $790 million for <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss>. Since the
                        modernized force would ultimately have operating costs about $250 million
                        per year lower than the present posture, the additional investment costs
                        would be recouped by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>78.</p>
                    <p>Given the advantage of the F–111 interceptors—an aircraft already in long
                        term production—and in the absence of a decision to deploy Nike-X, the
                        decision to modernize our air defense structure can be deferred for one
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The F–12 development program will be reoriented in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 to include
                        further design studies for the F–111 interceptor, cost studies, and
                        adaptation of the Navy AWG–9 fire control system for ADC use, using the
                        YF–12 as a test bed. The <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> development
                        program which supports both tactical and <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> defense missions, will be continued as a high priority
                        effort.</p>

                        approach to the system, and reduce costs. At this stage of development, a
                        deployment decision would be premature. We are also examining the utility of

                        include an expanded Civil Defense Program with dual purpose shelters in new
                        non-federal public and private construction in addition to the shelters <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0461"/>resulting from the present shelter
                        survey and stocking program, but no special purpose shelter construction.
                        The table shown below summarizes the protection offered by this program and
                        compares it with the Approved Program, considering the location of shelters
                        and limits on the movement of population.</p>
                    <p>The Approved Program extended to 1976 would cost $1.5 billion. Last year we
                        proposed a one year, $10 million experimental program to evaluate shelter
                        development in new construction. This program would give us information on
                        the feasibility of incorporating dual purpose shelters in new construction,
                        and on the necessary incentive schemes to stimulate shelter development.
                        Although this proposal was not approved by the Congress, continued study
                        indicates that such a program would provide for an efficient, controlled
                        Expanded Civil Defense Program over time by incorporating shelters in new
                        public construction and that this expansion can be matched to the deficits
                        that will remain after conclusion of the shelter survey program. It is
                        presently estimated that for $800 million we could add 50 million useful
                        spaces, and save an additional 3 to 4% of our population over the approved
                        program. An additional $1 billion spent on special purpose shelter
                        construction, to meet the residual deficit, would save less than one percent
                        of the population, and would not be warranted.</p>

                    <p>This is a personal note to express my concern that we may not be grappling
                        seriously and urgently enough with the question of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> freeze.</p>
                    <p>My purpose here isn’t to pass judgment on the issue, but to stress the need
                        for doing more than we are now doing, in order to be able to reach a
                        deliberate decision on that issue before such a decision is forced on us by
                        a series of inter-acting Soviet deployment and ad hoc U.S. budgetary
                        decisions.</p>
                    <p>In the broadest sense, the question is where trends in strategic offensive
                        and defensive weapons (on which we recently had an excellent <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> briefing in the Thursday group) are taking
                        us, and whether there is any alternative to drifting into the more dangerous
                        and unstable strategic world which these trends may foreshadow. We may not
                        be able to find an alternative (such as a viable <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> freeze), but we ought to be looking for one before events
                        carry us further downstream. We ought not to assume that because the Soviets
                        are now deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s they might not draw
                        them back if we proposed some alternative means of meeting both sides’
                        security needs.</p>
                    <p>The bureaucracy may be too unwieldy to meet this in time without a prod from
                        the President. Failing this, all you are likely to get is a staffing out of
                        possible <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> weapons effects by various
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> weapons proponents. (We are
                        currently arranging to get the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> study and
                        briefing to which you were exposed and which Bob Ginsburgh was kind enough
                        to tell me about.) This doesn’t fully meet the President’s need as he
                        reaches for decision, however.</p>
                    <p>Proposal: I would urge setting up a Wise Man’s Group, made up of inside and
                        outside talent, which would work full-time on this problem, on the QT, in
                        order to present to the President a careful evaluation of alternative
                        courses—before the range of options is precluded by the march of events,

                        have been impressed during the past few years with the relatively high level
                        of sophistication of the analysis in <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> of
                        the role of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s in our strategic
                        offensive-defensive posture. I think Henry is wrong in his impression that
                        Defense is being forced into a decision without giving the question serious
                        or sophisticated attention. The issue is certainly not being handled simply
                        as “a series of interacting Soviet deployment and ad hoc U.S. budgetary
                        decisions.” I think it most unfair to state that without a prod from the
                        President “all you are likely to get is a staffing out of possible <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> weapons effects by various <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> weapons proponents.” Henry has obviously
                        been talking to the wrong people. Finally, this problem has been a central
                        issue in arms control thinking in <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss> and
                        the rest of government for the past few years.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Henry’s specific proposal, I am not sure what he would really
                        want the “Wise Man’s Group” to do at this point or just who he thinks he
                        could get to work fulltime on this problem. The proposal seems somewhat
                        reminiscent of the Gaither Panel of 1957.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">Documentation on the Gaither Panel is in <ref target="frus1955-57v19#pg_464">

                    <p>With regard to independent review of the issue, I would note that for the
                        past six years I have been working on this problem with a very good <gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss> panel made up of the most knowledgeable
                        scientists on the subject.<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">Reference apparently

                            Committee; see <ref target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note> This group
                        has given and is currently giving useful independent evaluations of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> proposals, intelligence on the Soviet
                        program, <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0464"/>and the broader strategic
                        issues involved. On the basis of my experience with this and other panels, I
                        would emphasize the difficulty of getting useful advice on a problem of this
                        extreme complexity unless there are specific government proposals or
                        alternatives framed in advance. Therefore, since it is now apparent that
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will not propose an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment or the introduction of
                        other major new strategic systems as part of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–1968 budget, I would particularly question the utility of
                        organizing a new “Wise Man’s Group” at this time. Such a review might be
                        useful before we make a final commitment on this subject (next year?), but I
                        think we should think the plan through very carefully before launching
                        another Gaither Panel exercise.</p>

                    <p>In a telephone conversation on October 16, 1966, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> first discussed the Nuclear
                        Non-Proliferation Treaty. That part of their conversation is summarized in

                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then went on to report that
                        he had just gone over the fiscal year 1968 defense budget estimates
                        submitted by the military services. The President interjected, “Hold on and
                        let me get my hat,” and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        responded, “you’ll need more than your hat; [you’ll need] a storm
                        shelter.”</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then reported that these
                        military estimates totaled $98 billion. That figure he found “just
                        unbelievable and there’s no damned reason in the world for it and it won’t
                        come out that way.” When President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked what the military asked for last year,
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was about $75
                        or $72 billion. The President said that $10 billion had been added, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed but said that
                        that would be reduced. “But the $98 billion is just unbelievable. The next
                        60 days are just going to have to be budget cutting days.” “I’ve just got a
                        helluva task on my hands,” he shortly commented. Working with Deputy
                        Secretary Vance, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded,
                        “I can get it down to a reasonable level by Christmas time, but it’s going

                        through mid-1968, and to estimate general trends in these forces over the

                        <item>The Soviets retain their belief in the primacy of strategic attack and
                            defense forces, to deter the US and to support their foreign policy.
                            Soviet strategic attack forces will continue to include a variety of
                            weapon systems, with chief emphasis upon <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. The Soviets are building forces which we believe
                            will give them, in the next year or two, greatly increased confidence
                            that they have a retaliatory capability sufficient to assure the
                            destruction of a significant portion of US industrial resources and
                            population. They will probably also seek, through both strategic attack
                            and defense programs, to improve their ability to reduce the damage the
                            US can inflict on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                            deterrence fail and war in fact occur. We do not believe, however, that
                            the Soviets will <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0466"/>expect to
                            achieve by the mid-1970’s strategic capabilities which would make

                                Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, believes that developments of the past year
                                reflect a continuing Soviet dissatisfaction with a posture of
                                strategic inferiority vis-à-vis the US and a determination to
                                eliminate such inferiority. He would add the following to the final
                                sentence: “… but programs already underway, plus a continuing strong
                                    <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort, reflect a Soviet
                                determination to rise from a position of strategic inferiority to
                                one of at least numerical parity with the US in the belief that such
                                a posture would markedly enhance the aggressive pursuit of Communist
                                aims.” [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                            our belief that construction of launchers has been started at a higher

                            against large, soft targets such as cities. Deployment of the SS–9, a
                            large missile more suitable for attacking hard targets, is also
                            continuing, though at a slower rate than the SS–11.</item>

                        <item>The present Soviet stress on dispersed single silos, especially those
                            for the SS–11, probably reflects decisions taken several years ago to
                            improve sharply the survivability and thus the retaliatory capabilities
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force. In mid-1968 about 80
                            percent of the total launchers will be hard.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets might not find it advantageous to build <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> forces much larger than those we
                            estimate for 1968. On the other hand, they might consider their
                            deterrent to be significantly more convincing and their military power
                            improved if they can acquire an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            force about as large as that of the US. We therefore estimate a Soviet
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force of some 800–1,100
                            operational launchers in mid-1971 and some 800–1,200 in mid-1976.<note n="3" xml:id="d143fn3">Maj. Gen. <persName>Jack E.

                                probably will have upwards of 1,200 and perhaps 1,500 launchers by

                            of small, less expensive <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. A force
                            of 800 or so would probably incorporate greater qualitative improvements
                            and significant numbers of larger <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. Characteristic of future deployment will be hard silos
                            and possibly mobile launchers. Qualitative improvements will <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0467"/>probably include much better accuracies
                            and may include sophisticated reentry vehicles and penetration aids. The
                            development of the force will probably be marked by interruptions and
                            leveling-off phases as new, more effective systems are introduced and
                            older systems are phased out.</item>

                        <item>We think that <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> forces falling
                            anywhere within these estimated ranges could be considered as meeting a
                            broad Soviet criterion for a credible deterrent. Thus we intend our
                            estimate of future force levels as a range of uncertainty, either side
                            of which would reflect the same basic Soviet strategic concept. For a
                            period so far ahead, however, much will depend on the interplay between
                            US and Soviet decisions taken in the interim.</item>

                        <item>The Soviets have recently conducted feasibility tests of what may be a
                            depressed trajectory <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> or a
                            fractional orbit bombardment system. We cannot determine which, if
                            either, of these systems will be deployed. Either could become
                            operational during 1968 but probably would not be deployed in large
                            numbers.</item>

                            changes in the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM force have
                            been noted during the past year. We estimate that the current force
                            comprises somewhat over 700 operational launchers, some 135 of them
                            hard, deployed at about 200 sites. This force is capable of delivering a
                            devastating attack against Eurasian targets but is predominantly soft
                            and concentrated. We believe that throughout the period of this estimate

                            <hi rend="italic">Missile Submarines</hi>. The Soviets presently have
                            some 45 ballistic missile submarines (8–10 nuclear-powered) with a total
                            of about 130 launchers, and an equal number of cruise missile units
                            (21–23 nuclear-powered) with about 250 launchers. No new ballistic
                            missile submarines have become operational since 1963. We believe,
                            however, that a new class of ballistic missile submarine—which almost
                            certainly will be nuclear-powered and may carry 8 or more missiles with
                            a range of some 1,000 to 2,000 n.m.—will be operational by mid-1968. We
                            estimate that by 1976 the Soviets will have some 60 to 70 ballistic
                            missile submarines, including about 30 of the new type. We believe that
                            production of cruise missile submarines will continue, but at a reduced
                            rate, into the 1970’s. We estimate that some 55–65 of these units will
                            be operational in 1976.</item>

                            now composed of 950–1,000 bomber/tanker aircraft, 200–210 of which are
                            heavies and the rest mediums. The primary mission of the heavies is
                            intercontinental attack; at present, the Soviets could probably put
                            about 100 heavy bombers over US target areas on two-way missions. The
                            medium bombers are mainly for use against Eurasian targets, though a few
                            squadrons might be employed for initial strikes against Alaska, Canada,
                            Greenland, and Iceland. The Soviets could augment the force over North
                            America by using medium bombers on one-way missions, but we think this
                            unlikely. The Soviets may develop a new medium bomber during the period
                            of this estimate, but probably not a new heavy. We estimate that by 1976
                            attrition and retirement will have reduced the heavy force to some
                            70–100 aircraft and the medium force to about 300–500.<note n="4" xml:id="d143fn4">Maj. Gen. <persName>Jack E. Thomas</persName>,

                                intercontinental strike forces. He estimates the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has the capability
                                and—considering the currently limited size of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force—the requirement for a major
                                manned strategic bomber effort against the US in the event of

                            satellites including reconnaissance types. Within the next 5 to 10 years
                            the Soviets will probably develop and employ a variety of space systems
                            (such as navigation and communications satellites) to further support
                            their strategic attack forces. The Soviets have long had the capability
                            to orbit a nuclear-armed satellite and have frequently alluded to
                            “orbital rockets.” Recent feasibility tests could lead to a
                            multiple-orbit bombardment system. For the foreseeable future, however,
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s are likely to be much more
                            effective and far less costly. This, plus the political liability which
                            would be incurred by orbiting a nuclear weapon, lead us to believe that
                            the Soviets are unlikely to deploy a multiple-orbit bombardment system
                            in space during the period of this estimate.</item>

                            improve strategic attack systems. A high level of <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> activity is expected to continue. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> appears <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0469"/>to be about as capable as the US of developing new

                            enough to justify the expenditure of resources. In deciding to deploy
                            any new weapon system, however, the Soviets would have to weigh the

                                    better systems, and the possible course of US military programs.
                                    They may decide that there is little strategic advantage in
                                    building an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force much
                                    larger than the one they will have in 1968. On the other hand,
                                    they may seek to strengthen their deterrent and military power
                                    still more by increasing their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force to about the size of the one now planned
                                    by the US. In either case, they will probably introduce new

                                    missiles, more like US Polaris submarines than are present
                                    Soviet types. Missile submarines will increase their patrolling
                                    in the open seas, and in a few years a number of them may be on
                                    station within missile range of the US. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will keep large numbers of
                                    bombers and missiles which could deliver massive attacks against

                    </p>
                    <p>The draft states that the President does not now expect to authorize first
                        use of lethal <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> weapons. With respect to
                        incapacitants, it reflects the actual situation as it now exists by stating
                        that the President may authorize their use in certain situations of national
                        urgency. In my view, we should keep this option open until we have better
                        information concerning specific incapacitating agents, their military
                        effectiveness, and the political consequences of their use. Accordingly, I
                        have asked the members of my staff to conduct a study on the role of
                        incapacitating agents. The results of this study will be reflected in next
                        year’s Draft Memorandum for the President on Theater Nuclear Warfare. In the
                        meantime, I believe policy guidelines such as those in the attached draft
                            <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> would be appropriate and
                        desirable.</p>

                        <item>The Soviet leaders give a higher priority to strategic defenses than
                            does the US; they allocate about equal resources to their strategic
                            attack and their strategic defense forces. The Soviet object in building
                            their strategic defenses is to contribute to deterrence and to foreign
                            policy support, and to limit the damage the US could inflict on the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The Soviets will continue to
                            emphasize strategic defense throughout the next 10 years, and will
                            pursue their efforts to meet the changing US threat. They will seek,
                            through both offensive and defensive programs, to improve their
                            strategic position relative to that of the US. (Paras. l-5)</item>

                        <item>The Soviets have steadily improved their strategic defenses against
                            aerodynamic vehicles over the last decade, by upgrading their air
                            surveillance system and by developing and deploying both manned
                            interceptors and surface-to-air missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>) systems. Through these systems they have achieved a
                            formidable capability against subsonic and low-supersonic aircraft
                            attempting to penetrate at medium and high altitudes to principal target
                            areas. Current systems are progressively less effective against higher
                            performance aircraft, standoff weapons, and low-altitude penetrations.
                            At present, Soviet strategic air defenses have virtually no
                            effectiveness at altitudes below about 1,000 feet.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Rear Adm. E.B. Fluckey, Assistant Chief of Naval

                        <item>The Soviets will be deploying over the next few years improved air
                            surveillance radars, air defense communications and control systems, and
                            defensive weapon systems with capabilities against aero-dynamic
                            vehicles. They are now deploying an interceptor with improved
                            low-altitude capabilities. We believe they will also deploy new
                            interceptors with a better capability to defend against standoff weapons
                            and higher performance aircraft. Although we think the Soviets will
                            continue to work on the problem of defense against penetrations below
                            1,000 feet, we do not expect any system with such capabilities to be
                            operational before about 1970. (Paras. 17–19, 23–28, 38)</item>

                        <item>Since 1964 the Soviets have been constructing complexes for a new
                            missile system for strategic defense, which we call the Tallinn system.
                            There are now probably 20–25 complexes (each with multiple launch sites)
                            under construction. We believe all of these will become operational in
                            1967 and 1968. The deployment concept appears to include both forward
                            defense on likely approaches to the industrial region of European <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and local defense of selected
                            targets. We believe that the rate at which new complexes have been
                            started has increased in the past year or so, and that this system will
                            be widely deployed throughout the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.

                                They acknowledge that the available evidence does support a
                                conclusion that these sites may have a defensive mission against the
                                aerodynamic threat. However, on balance, considering all information
                                available, they believe it is more likely that the systems being
                                deployed are for defense against ballistic missiles with an
                                additional capability to defend against high flying supersonic
                                aerodynamic vehicles. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                            Depending on the characteristics of some components, however, the system
                            could have capabilities against ballistic missiles. We have therefore
                            assessed the potential of the Tallinn system in both the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> and antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) roles. (Para. 35)</item>

                        <item>In the <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> role, we believe the
                            Tallinn system represents a considerable improvement over currently
                            operational Soviet <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s in terms of
                            range (on the order of 100 n.m.), altitude (up to 100,000 feet), and
                            ability to deal with supersonic targets (up to Mach 3 or 3.5). We <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0474"/>do not believe it is the Soviet
                            answer to the low-altitude threat. If the system was designed as an
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, then data would have to be fed
                            to the complexes from off-site radars in order for them to defend areas
                            large enough to provide a strategic <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            defense. Some of the Tallinn complexes are in locations where they could
                            take advantage of such data from known radars of appropriate types, but
                            some are not. With such data, the Tallinn complexes may be capable of
                            exoatmospheric intercept of incoming ballistic missiles at distances out
                            to about 200 n.m., and thus each complex could defend a fairly large
                            area. Without such data, the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            capabilities of each complex would be seriously reduced and limited to
                            local and self-defense. (Paras. 36, 51)</item>

                        <item>After an intensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> research and
                            development program, the Soviets decided at least five years ago to
                            deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system at Moscow. This
                            system (which we call the Moscow system) will achieve an initial
                            capability in the next year or two, and all sites now under construction
                            will be completed by about 1970. We believe that it is a long-range
                            exoatmospheric system with a large kill radius, and that the primary
                            purpose of its present deployment is the defense of Moscow. (Paras. 39,

                        <item>The Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system probably will
                            have a good capability against a numerically limited attack by currently
                            operational US missiles. Its capabilities could be degraded by advanced
                            penetration systems, and it could not cope with a very heavy attack.
                            Furthermore, the system utilizes data from large radars for it to
                            function most effectively. Without these radars, the capabilities of the
                            system would be seriously reduced, though if the launch sites were
                            designed to operate autonomously, the system could still intercept some
                            missiles targeted against Moscow. The present deployment will cover only
                            a part of the Polaris threat to Moscow. (Paras. 48–50)</item>

                        <item>We cannot now identify any wholly new <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system in development and we do not expect any to
                            become operational before the early 1970’s. In view of the presently
                            limited capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses
                            now under construction, we believe the Soviets will devote substantial
                            efforts to upgrading their present hardware, developing improved <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, and improving their detection
                            and tracking capabilities. The Soviets might decide that <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses for the general defense of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are too costly. We think it
                            likely, however, that they will extend their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. But we think they will be cautious about
                            committing themselves to a fixed policy with respect to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment over the long term. They
                            will probably adjust whatever program they pursue on the basis of a
                            number of factors, including the capabilities of present defenses to
                            deal with penetration aids, the advances in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> technology, the cost of additional deployment relative

                                part of a Soviet retaliatory assured destruction defensive weapons
                                system. Moscow, at the hub of all defense and counter strike and the
                                center of command and control, must avoid destruction long enough to
                                provide time for decision, retaliation, damage assessment of the
                                Soviet Union, and rapid communications with the outside world.
                                Should the US strike first, the Soviets would have only about 10
                                minutes tactical warning, compared to our own short 15 minutes if
                                the Soviets strike first. They may consider this reaction time
                                insufficient and so are willing to expend substantial funds to cover

                        <item>In the course of their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program,
                            the Soviets have developed large radars which have good capabilities for
                            tracking ballistic missiles and space vehicles. A number of radars of
                            this type, now under construction, will become operational in 1967–1968.
                            Although they do not all have the same functions, we believe that in the
                            aggregate they will provide the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            with a national space surveillance capability. Within the next 5 to 10
                            years the Soviets will probably develop and employ a variety of space
                            systems (such as infrared detection and other types of warning) in

                        <item>We have no positive evidence that the Soviets are developing
                            antisatellite defenses, but we believe they have had an incentive to do
                            so for some time. It would be technically possible for them to have a
                            limited antisatellite capability already, based on existing radars and
                            missiles and requiring a nuclear weapon to achieve a kill. When their
                            new space surveillance radars are operational in 1967–1968, they could
                            have a capability to destroy satellites by either nuclear or nonnuclear
                            means after the satellites had passed over the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a few times. The Soviets may also explore techniques
                            for neutralizing satellites without destroying them. A manned satellite
                            inspection and antisatellite system could be developed in the 1970’s. We
                            believe, however, that the Soviets would seek to destroy or neutralize
                            US satellites only if they believed general war were imminent. There
                            might also be some other special circumstances in which they would use
                            antisatellite systems in peacetime, such as an occasion in which they
                            believed they were retaliating against US interference with their own
                            satellites. (Paras. 61, 64–67)</item>

                        <item>Over the past decade or more the Soviets have developed an extensive
                            civil defense program, which is now administered by the <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0476"/>Ministry of Defense. The current
                            program is characterized by widespread public training, the use of

                            and we have no indication that the Soviets would regard a stepped up

                            <item>The crucial question in this estimate concerns the status of
                                Soviet defense against ballistic missiles. We know the Soviets have
                                been engaged in research and development in this field for more than
                                ten years. The intelligence community is agreed that an
                                anti-ballistic missile system has been under construction in the
                                Moscow area since 1962 and will begin to be operational in the next
                                year or two. It will probably have good capabilities against a
                                limited-scale attack on Moscow by present US <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. We <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0477"/>believe that its effectiveness could be reduced by
                                advanced penetration systems, and that it could not cope with a very
                                heavy attack or with Polaris attacks from certain directions. At
                                present there is no indication that this system is being installed

                                reached operational status.)</item>

                                    year. The intelligence community does not have enough
                                    information about this system to be certain of exactly what it
                                    is designed to defend against—whether ballistic missiles or
                                    aerodynamic vehicles. The general nature of the system, its
                                    equipment, and the pattern of its deployment lead me to believe
                                    it is an improved defense against high-speed, high-altitude
                                    aircraft, and also against the air-to-surface missiles that such
                                    aircraft may launch. But I cannot rule out the possibility that
                                    it is a defense against ballistic missiles. My views about this
                                    system are shared by the intelligence officers of the Department
                                    of State, the US Navy, and the Atomic Energy Commission, and by
                                    the Director of the National Security Agency.</p>
                                <p>Disagreement with these views is expressed by the Director of the
                                    Defense Intelligence Agency and the intelligence officers of the
                                    US Army and US Air Force. Their view is that while a confident
                                    judgment cannot now be made as to whether this system is for
                                    defense against ballistic missiles, aerodynamic vehicles, or
                                    both, it is more likely to be an anti-ballistic missile system
                                    with an additional capability to defend against high-flying
                                    supersonic aerodynamic vehicles. (Because of the uncertainties
                                    and our differences of view, we have included in the estimate an
                                    evaluation of the capabilities of this system in both
                                    roles.)</p>

                            <item>We are all agreed that the Soviets could have a limited
                                anti-satellite capability now. Furthermore, they are building a
                                space surveillance radar network which could support a much improved
                                system. In a year or so they may be able to destroy our
                                reconnaissance and other satellites by non-nuclear means; they may
                                explore techniques for neutralizing satellites without destroying
                                them. But we do not think they would actually try to neutralize or
                                destroy US satellite unless they thought war were imminent or unless
                                there were other special circumstances, such as an occasion in which
                                they thought they were retaliating against US interference with
                                their satellites.</item>

                                introduces higher performance aircraft and air-to-surface missiles.
                                The Soviets are working to improve their capabilities against these

                        certain of the memoranda. In some instances, I am suggesting specific
                        follow-up actions. However, if you believe it would be desirable for us to
                        discuss any of these matters before we undertake further specific staff

                                policies and our future military programs? (Included in this

                            <item>What international political implications should we expect to grow
                                out of the improving Soviet strategic missile force, Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, etc., and how should
                                those implications be handled?</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your memorandum to the President makes it quite clear that our own offensive
                        systems are going to maintain our assured destruction capability under any
                        circumstances. While it is clear that Soviet capabilities will become
                        increasingly potent and secure I do not think the situation of mutual
                        deterrence has changed fundamentally from that which we have had to face
                        over the past several years.</p>
                    <p>However, I do think that we ought to consider whether the Soviets will assess
                        the situation as we do. I do not think it probable that they will make an
                        erroneous assumption, but we must make every effort to insure that the
                        Soviets do not reach the conclusion that a more convincing second strike
                        capability gives them greater latitude for the use of conventional military
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Your memorandum provides an excellent summary of the present and projected
                        strategic balance. However, in order to understand better the implications
                        for our security policy of this complex and dynamic situation I would like
                        to suggest that our staffs cooperate in examining in some detail the
                        interaction of US and Soviet strategic capabilities past, present and
                        future. Future projections should also take account of estimated Chinese
                        strategic nuclear capabilities and how they affect the US-Soviet strategic
                        relationship as well as the situation between the US and China. I would hope
                        that such an analysis would illustrate, for a range of scenarios the major
                        changes in the strategic nuclear balance from 1960 to the present and their
                        military effects, and how this balance might change at specific future dates
                        through 1975, as new capabilities appear on both sides.</p>
                    <p>This would provide a data base, which in conjunction with other factors,
                        would permit a clearer assessment of the implications for our security
                        position of projected US, Soviet and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>
                        postures, and the impact of these changes on our foreign relations. Among
                        other things, a careful and detailed analysis might serve to sharpen our
                        thinking and provide a better basis for discussions with our allies who are
                        likely to be increasingly concerned, or at least uncertain, about the effect
                        on their security of changing strategic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>I am asking Foy Kohler, in his new capacity as Deputy Under Secretary for
                        Political Affairs, to discuss this suggestion with whomever you designate
                        from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>. In view of the sensitivity of the
                        subject matter, I propose to limit participation in this analysis to a very
                        small <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0480"/>group in State, and I assume
                        you will want to do the same with regard to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> participation. It may well be that a presentation to the
                        President of our analysis and conclusions might eventually be desirable. I
                        am enclosing at Tab A a list of some of the issues<note n="3" xml:id="d148fn3">Not printed.</note> that I think might be illuminated
                        by the proposed joint analysis, though I suggest this be considered as a
                        point of departure, rather than a comprehensive or final description of the
                        proposed analysis.</p>
                    <p>This leads to my second question. Even though we may be persuaded that mutual
                        deterrence persists and the validity of our commitments is unchanged, the
                        conclusions to be drawn from the new developments in both Soviet and US
                        nuclear capabilities will not be immediately clear to all our allies, nor to
                        third parties on the international scene. It will be important for us to
                        think through what impressions we want to convey and how we wish to convey
                        them. It is, therefore, imperative that we have a clear, consistent and
                        agreed line within the government which can be followed both at home and
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> is a special, but integral part of
                        the foregoing problem. I have emphasized previously my great interest in
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> developments and the political
                        importance I attach to any decision regarding a US deployment, whether it be
                        positive or negative. The clear evidence of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program, and your recent public statement about it<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">Presumably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s press conference in Austin,
                            Texas, on November 9, at which he announced that the U.S. Government had
                            good evidence that the Soviets were building an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system around Moscow.</note> place this matter in a new
                        perspective. I believe it is certain that we will face growing Congressional
                        and public pressures to begin an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment ourselves. I recognize that there are persuasive arguments for
                        and against deployment, and the decision will not be an easy one. I want to
                        emphasize, however, one point I have made in the past. I do not believe
                        foreign policy problems should in any way prevent us from deploying an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system at such time as it is
                        determined to be necessary for the security of the US.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, we can anticipate concern from some of our allies if we do make
                        a decision to deploy. Thus, we will need to plan together very carefully how
                        we approach our allies on this matter, and particularly how we deal with the
                        difficult question of possible overseas deployment of such a system.</p>
                    <p>There will be several opportunities in the near future for a comprehensive US
                        Government statement on the strategic balance including the President’s

                        problems that we want, I am proposing that the enclosed set of guidelines
                        (Tab B)<note n="6" xml:id="d148fn6">Not printed.</note> be utilized in
                        preparing any statements, public or private, which will impact on
                        international audiences. If you agree, our staffs might jointly refine these
                        guidelines from time to time to keep them abreast of developments, referring
                        to your consideration and mine any major unresolved policy issues. I would,
                        of course, appreciate any suggestions you would care to offer for additions
                        or adjustments to the guidelines I am enclosing. I am also sending copies of
                        these guidelines to <persName>Bill Foster</persName> and Len Marks asking
                        for their comments and suggestions.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In reviewing your several memoranda on general purpose land, air and lift
                        forces, two major questions appeared to me to warrant further comment: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Can we define more precisely the circumstances in which US
                                conventional forces, including strategic lift, will have relevance
                                in a future that will unquestionably include continuing military
                                conflict and threats of violence in various parts of the world,
                                and</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>How should US and allied military capabilities relate to one
                                another?</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>As you have pointed out, it is not easy to establish future requirements for
                        general purpose forces. The wide variety of possible contingencies, the
                        uncertainties as to the scope and timing of future conflicts, and the
                        diversity of the forces involved do not allow the sort of rigorous analysis
                        that can be applied to strategic force requirements. It is just these
                        general purpose forces, however, that provide us with the flexibility we
                        require to pursue our foreign policy objectives.</p>
                    <p>Clearly we have today far more powerful mobile and balanced forces than we
                        had six years ago, and I am impressed by the rate at which their development
                        is proceeding. Nevertheless, the level of conflict in the world is
                        frighteningly high, and while we have no mandate to police the world and no
                        inclination to do so, our security is directly related to the security of
                        others. Obviously, we must deal with the <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0482"/>sources of conflict and try to eradicate them if possible
                        before violence erupts. But there remains the problem of containing and
                        settling conflicts that may occur and of minimizing direct involvement of US
                        forces while maximizing their deterrent influence. I assume that it would
                        assist in your force planning analysis if we were able to help define
                        somewhat more clearly what appear to be the most likely future conflicts
                        which may confront us, and their nature. We might also investigate more
                        deeply the kind of settlement to such conflicts we would hope to see.</p>
                    <p>I have no illusions about the difficulty of this task and I doubt that we can
                        expect precision in such definitions. But, perhaps we can go further than we
                        have heretofore. I believe, for example, that my own staff can be set to
                        work examining in greater depth the future international environmental and
                        developing reasonable politico-military assumptions useful for force
                        planning.</p>
                    <p>I gather from your memoranda that your own staff is looking at future
                        contingencies with a view to establishing future logistics requirements.
                        These two staff efforts seem to me to be logically related if indeed they
                        are not complementary. Both of them also bear some relationship to the work
                        of the interagency Contingency Coordinating Committee, which has developed a
                        number of plans that might provide a point of departure.</p>
                    <p>Finally, one area which I believe has not received a recent and thorough
                        examination, from either the political or the military points of view, is
                        how and in what ways indigenous country military efforts should relate to US
                        efforts. I have in mind questions ranging from the contribution US military
                        assistance might make in reducing reliance on early use of US force to the
                        future needs for bases, overflight rights and access to foreign territory.
                        All of these are essential elements in planning the size and nature of our
                        own conventional forces and especially of our future strategic mobility
                        needs. Moreover, such an examination of indigenous capabilities in relation
                        to our own seems to me central to the formulation of a concept for the role
                        which US force should be prepared to play in the future.</p>
                    <p>I would like to suggest that our two Departments jointly address these
                        problems. We have, by way of example, made an effort to identify some
                        illustrative questions which might be analyzed (Tab C).<note n="7" xml:id="d148fn7">Not printed.</note> I wish to emphasize the fact that
                        they are only illustrative, and again, I am asking Foy Kohler to pursue this
                        line of inquiry with your representatives to see how far we can usefully
                        carry such a joint analysis. Foy will of course have available the
                        assistance from our geographic bureaus and <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0483"/>policy planning staff which should be able to contribute
                        significantly to this undertaking.</p>

                    <p>Your memorandum on European Forces and Strategy is one which raises important

                                    final.” In response to the President’s questions, he said the
                                    budget figures included the anti-missile missile but excluded
                                    the pay increase and what <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> called “the construction stimulants.”

                    <p>The President asked if the Joint Chiefs confirmed Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s statement. The Chairman so
                        stated, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">David <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0486"/>McDonald</persName> added that in his
                        experience the Secretary and the Chiefs have never been “so close together,”
                        except on the five specified issues.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> then stated the case
                        for the deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. He said
                        two new facts had to be taken into account: (1) the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system around Moscow, and they were deploying a system widely throughout the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> which might have <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities; (2) they were installing at
                        an accelerated rate hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s, the
                            <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-11, a city buster. By 1971 they might
                        have between 800–1100 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s.</p>
                    <p>We do not know the objective of Soviet nuclear policy: whether it is parity
                        with the U.S. or superiority. But, taken together, their new program could
                        reduce our assured destruction capability; complicate our targeting; reduce
                        confidence in our ability to penetrate; reduce our first-strike capability;
                        and improve the Soviet capability to pursue aims short of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then quoted from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s paper<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">Not found, but

                                understood by the Soviets that we possess strategic nuclear forces
                                so powerful as to be capable of absorbing a Soviet first strike and
                                surviving with sufficient strength to impose unacceptable damage on

                                it in the future, adjusting our forces to offset actual or potential
                                changes in theirs.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> expressed disagreement
                        with this judgment. He said we cannot predict confidently how the Soviet
                        Union would react to counter our deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. The costs would constitute an important diversion
                        of resources. The development of multiple warheads would reduce the
                        kilotonnage of their nuclear payloads; they would face grave uncertainties
                        in targeting against our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s. He said
                        deterrence was not only technology, it was a state of mind. Our having <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0487"/>an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would increase our deterrence capability no matter
                        what they did.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, a lack of a deployed <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        might increase the possibilities of war by accident; create an imbalance or
                        a sense of imbalance between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; suggest that we are interested only in the offense;
                        suggest also that the U.S. was not willing to pay to maintain its present
                        nuclear superiority.</p>
                    <p>We would be denying to many of our own people a chance to survive a nuclear
                        exchange: 30–50 million lives might be saved by Nike-X.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommends to the
                        President that we initiate deployment of the Nike-X system in order to
                        maintain the present overall favorable nuclear balance and give to us some
                        or all of the following advantages: <list>

                            <item>—to demonstrate that we are not first-strike minded;</item>
                            <item>—and to maintain the kind of favorable power environment which
                                helped us during the Cuba missile crisis.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Specifically the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommends that we
                        immediately decide to develop Option A to protect 25 U.S. cities. The cost
                        in Fiscal 1968 would be $800 million; for the period Fiscal 67–76, $10
                        billion.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if there was any difference between the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concerning the costs. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said “No.”</p>
                    <p>The President then asked if our position would be better if the Soviet Union
                        did not react to our deployment. The Secretary agreed that our position
                        would be better; but that it was “inconceivable” that the Soviet Union would
                        not react to counter our deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked what determined the difference in judgment between
                        the Secretary and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that the
                        difference lay less in rational calculation than in the inherently emotional
                        nature of the issue. It was extremely hard to make the case for a policy
                        which appeared to be denying protection to our people, when the Soviet Union
                        was willing to employ large resources to protect its people. He said he was
                        fully aware that if the President decided against deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system he would face a most difficult time
                        politically and psychologically. Why, then, does he recommend against?</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>First, the Soviet Union has been wrong in its nuclear defense policy
                            for a decade. They have systematically spent 2 or 3 times what we have
                            on defense. It has not been worth it. Their defenses are not worth <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>a damn. We still can impose
                            unacceptable losses on them even after a first strike. Because they are
                            making an error in deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s is no
                            reason we should also make that error.</item>
                        <item>Second, we must be clear why it would be an error for us. If we go
                            ahead with the $10 billion <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program
                            and they did not [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                            it. Their security would depend on their doing something about it. They
                            would have to bring back their assured damage capability to something
                            like 80 million U.S. fatalities under their planning case, which is [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. As they did so, we could not hold to our initial $10
                            million [<hi rend="italic">billion</hi>?] <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. We would have to expand in response to what
                            they did, both our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and our offensive
                            systems.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded that we
                        would be launching ourselves and the Soviet Union into two decades of
                        escalatory action in the nuclear field in which the costs on each side would
                        prove to be of the order of $31–40 billion. We would each end up no better
                        off than we are at present.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then said there
                        are certain rational roles for a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system, in particular these four: <list>
                            <item>—to protect our offensive force, notably our Minutemen;</item>
                            <item>—to protect in the time frame 1975–85 against a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability;</item>
                            <item>—to protect against an accidental firing of a single
                                missile;</item>
                            <item>—to protect against a small blackmail Soviet attack.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the face of the terrible dilemma faced by the President, Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is inclined to
                        recommend, as a fallback from his judgment against the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, a limited system with these four
                        capabilities. On the basis of that system we could explore whether the
                        Soviet Union was willing to negotiate a freeze acceptable to us.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked, “Is there any middle ground in this debate?”
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the
                        emotionalism attaching to the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> issue made
                        middle ground hard to find.</p>
                    <p>The President asked what would the view be in the Congress?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said about 25% of
                        the Congress—the Liberals—would oppose the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. Senators Russell, Stennis, etc., would strongly favor it,
                        and they would have about 40% of the Congress with them. The balance of 35%
                        would remain in the middle and be subject to persuasion. The President asked
                        who might be on that middle ground. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied Senators like Kuchel and Javits.</p>
                    <p>He pointed out further that the Congress had been interesting itself in this
                        matter for a long time. Last year they voted $165 million for <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0489"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s, and when he inquired what they had in
                        mind, they didn’t know; they merely wanted to move in that direction.</p>
                    <p>The President asked again, “What is a middle alternative?”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that
                        we did not have to make a final decision one way or the other right now. For
                        example, we had important technical problems to overcome with respect to the
                        warheads for the Olympia <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. We had to
                        install at Kwajalein a quite revolutionary system for ′69 tests of the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. It is quite risky in fact to start
                        building [a] plant for the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system before
                        those tests are complete. In short, there are technical reasons to go
                        slow.</p>
                    <p>With these unsolved technical problems as a background, we could move forward
                        with a limited system to get the four objectives Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had earlier stated. As for the
                        fifth objective—population protection—we would not be able to walk away from
                        that forever, but we would have some time to see if anything could be worked
                        out with the Soviet Union to avoid the interacting escalation in the nuclear
                        arms race that was otherwise inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> then added that
                        he did not believe we could stand for long with Posture A, which promised to
                        protect 25 cities. Under pressure from other cities and regions, the
                        Congress would go for a full program. It would be wiser to face from the
                        beginning that if we started down the road to population protection, it is
                        really Posture B that we were undertaking—a $20 billion rather than a $10
                        billion program.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that, given the
                        lead time, we ought to begin to build factories now for certain of the
                        components about which we are technically sure. We do not have that
                        capability and it should not be delayed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> came back again to
                        the point that a decision not to deploy would create emotional and political
                        problems in the country, and that a decision to deploy merely to protect
                        offensive forces would face the same emotional problem. There would be a
                        strong impulse to protect people, not missiles. As for the factories, he
                        said the components are complex; there are many parts to be tested.</p>
                    <p>Our experience is that the system will prove more expensive than we presently
                        calculated.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said the critical
                        question was U.S. casualties. An <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        would cut our casualties in a nuclear exchange. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he completely
                        disagreed because the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would react to
                        re-establish its assured damage capability.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said that there were
                        constraints on their ability if they did react. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that both an Air Force
                            <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0490"/>study and an <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> had indicated that the Soviet Union could
                        not afford not to react.<note n="4" xml:id="d150fn4">Neither of these
                            documents has been further identified.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President wondered if the best opportunity for agreement among us would
                        not be a decision to move ahead on a limited basis and to see what we can
                        negotiate with the Soviet Union. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said the Soviet Union was now moving ahead both
                        with <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s and to increase its offensive
                        nuclear force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        said that their defensive effort was wasted.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said that their
                        defensive effort was not wholly wasted. They had imposed heavy additional
                        costs on the U.S. to assure our continued penetration ability.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we have
                        over-reacted. We have more than insured that we can still maintain our
                        assured damage capability. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s
                        have not saved Soviet lives.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said he can’t
                        forget that we are dealing with the descendants of Genghis Khan. They only
                        understand force.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed and said
                        that is why, at whatever cost, we must maintain our assured second-strike
                        damage capability. Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> added that that is why we have gone ahead with
                        Poseidon and other means to assure our ability to penetrate an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked if the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would wish to express any views if
                        there were a press conference. The members of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> replied that none of them desired to meet the press.</p>
                    <p>The subject then turned to the second item in which there was disagreement;
                        that is, the advanced strategic bomber (<gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>).<note n="5" xml:id="d150fn5">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> to state the position of the
                        Joint Chiefs with respect to <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>. General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said that the Chiefs
                        wish to proceed to contract definition. He said he wanted to make very clear
                        that this did not mean full-scale development. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said further that the Chiefs
                        wish to do full-scale development of the engines required for an advanced
                        manned strategic aircraft, but went on to point out that this engine would
                        have uses for other aircraft as well as <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>. He stated, thirdly, that the Chiefs wish to proceed with
                        further avionic development for the <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>.
                        He said the Chiefs wish to proceed to contract definition so that we would
                        be in a position to seek to obtain an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> in
                        1974. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> went on to
                        say that it was his own personal belief that it would not be possible to get
                        an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of 1974, even if we proceeded on the
                        schedule recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. He said he
                        believed that a more likely <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> would be
                        1976.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that he and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> did not feel that we need
                        an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of 1974. Further, he said it is not
                        clear that we need a new manned bomber.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> the difference between the FB–111 and the <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> in respect of speed and other
                        characteristics. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>
                        said the <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> would have a slightly higher
                        speed, more range, and a substantially greater bomb carrying capacity. He
                        said the latter factor was of greatest importance. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said he wanted to repeat that
                        he is not asking for full-scale development.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then said it is doubtful
                        that we will need a new manned bomber because of difficulties associated
                        with penetration of the Soviet Union during that time period. He also said
                        that missiles plus the FB–111 force which the United States will have at
                        that time may be enough to meet our force requirements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that it was his
                        opinion, and that of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>, that
                        we did not need to move as fast as the Air Force is requesting, and <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0492"/>that we should go forward with the
                        development of engines and avionics which are not unique to the <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> then said he
                        wanted to point out that the Air Force had done a number of studies which
                        had indicated that a mixture of bombers and missiles is more cost effective
                        than missiles alone.</p>
                    <p>The President said he would consider the matter and give his decision at a
                        later date.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the difference
                        between the recommendation of the Chiefs and that of himself and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> was merely when we might
                        need such an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile. He said we do not
                        disagree that preliminary work should be started.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> stated that the
                        Joint Chiefs recommend that we develop an <gloss target="#t_ICM1">ICM</gloss> at a total cost in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                        of $36 million. This $36 million would be broken down into $10 million for
                        various component development, and the balance for contract definition.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said the
                        Secretary of the Air Force would not go to contract definition but would
                        spend $19 million for component development. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said the Joint Chiefs could
                        live with a $19 million program.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded that he
                        thought we could work this out as he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> were recommending a program of $19 million, and the
                        only question between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> was how fast we should proceed.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> emphasized that
                        for the expenditure of $2–1/2 million in offense, we could cause the Soviets
                        to spend $80 million in defense. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that this was the very point he and Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> had been making in the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> discussion.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">3. Army Force Structure</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the Army has
                        recommended that two more brigades be authorized in the Active Army, with a
                        possibility of adding another division to the Active Army force structure in
                        Calendar Year 1967. He said the Army proposed that these additional forces
                        be equipped with equipment taken from the Reserve. He pointed out that thus
                        the effect of authorizing these additional forces would merely be one of
                        substituting the deployment time of Active forces for Reserve forces. He
                        then asked General <persName>Johnson</persName> to speak to this issue.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said that normally we
                        use Active forces to build a time bridge, during which time Reserve forces
                        are called to active duty and brought to a point of training where they can
                        be deployed. He said that with respect to part of our Reserve force, i.e.,
                        the Selected Reserve <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0493"/>Force, we have
                        reduced the training time required before that force could be deployed from
                        14 to 11 weeks. He said we expect to reduce it further to reach a goal of 8
                        weeks.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> then said he wanted
                        to point out that we had certain additional “bills” which had been laid
                        before us: (1) the requirement of three divisions to meet <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments; (2) 40,000 personnel to
                        maintain the proposed barrier in South Vietnam; and (3) a corps contingency
                        force of three divisions. He said that to meet these “bills” we have only
                        five division forces in the continental United States in the Active Army. He
                        said this caused him concern because of indications of possible aggressive
                        action by the North Koreans, and the possibility that the situation might
                        become more unstable in Cyprus and Jordan, and that the United States might
                        be required to supply forces for these contingencies.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said if he were
                        queried by the Congress as to the adequacy of our ground forces, he would
                        have to say we were very thin. He said, therefore, he recommends that the
                        additional forces he has requested be authorized.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we are
                        equipment limited—that this did not mean we did not have additional
                        equipment, but that we had bought equipment for only the authorized force
                        structure. He said, therefore, what General <persName>Johnson</persName> was
                        talking about was merely shifting equipment from the Reserve to the Active
                        Army, thus substituting a slight reduction in reaction time.</p>
                    <p>He said an alternative to General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName>’s proposal was the calling up of Reserves. He said
                        further that he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> had
                        raised with the Joint Chiefs last week the desirability of calling up
                        Reserves, and they did not recommend we do so at this time. The President
                        then asked each of the Chiefs whether they favored a call-up of Reserves at
                        this time. Each of the Chiefs replied in the negative.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that we were
                        proposing to go forward with the construction of one <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss>, which had been authorized in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 budget, and the construction of two
                            <gloss target="#t_DDG1">DDG</gloss>’s. He said that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> would recommend that we add
                        another <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 budget. He pointed out, however, that he thought there
                        was a broader issue that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> might wish to address—the entire shipbuilding
                        program.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said he wanted to
                        point out that there had been no major Navy escort ships constructed since
                        1962. He said last year the Department of Defense had supported two <gloss target="#t_DDG1">DDG</gloss>’s but no <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss>. He said he felt this year we ought to have one more
                            <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss> over and above the one authorized
                        by the Congress in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967, and that if we
                        did not <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0494"/>put in another <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss>, we would end up in the same wrangle with
                        the Congress that we had last year.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said the basic
                        issue is how many nuclear escorts there should be per carrier. He said he
                        and the Navy believe there should be two per nuclear carrier, while Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> felt there should be only one.
                        Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said he did not
                        feel we were pushing too fast on nuclear power, because the Navy was asking
                        for only these two <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss>’s and was not
                        asking for any other nuclear powered ships.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said he also wanted
                        to mention the issue of nuclear submarines. He said nuclear submarines were
                        one of the most important elements of our <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program. He said currently we have 105 submarines in our
                            <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> program, and that this figure was
                        agreed to by both the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He
                        said the Navy feels that all of these submarines should be nuclear powered,
                        but that up to now the Office of the Secretary of Defense believes that we
                        should have only 68 nuclear submarines. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said that in the past we had
                        been constructing five nuclear attack submarines per year, and the Navy
                        feels we should continue at five per year until we get a higher number.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said his main
                        concern is what happens in 1968 and beyond, and that we need at least five
                        per year for the next three years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that the
                        Navy hopes in 1968 to have a newer class of submarine. Therefore, he said
                        both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> have felt it
                        advantageous to put two of the five submarines which were tentatively
                        scheduled for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 over until next year,
                        which would thus permit the Navy to take advantage of the newer technology
                        that would be available in such a new class.</p>
                    <p>The President reserved decision on this issue.</p>
                    <p>The President on three different occasions during the discussions asked
                        whether it was correct to state that, apart from the five issues which had
                        been presented to him, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were in general agreement
                        with the budget. Each of the Chiefs said that this was the fact. Admiral
                            <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> stated that he thought
                        the Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> were closer together this year than any other year
                        that he could remember.</p>

                        memorandum went into the pros and cons of the whole question. The President
                        had studied it and asked those of us at the meeting to prepare,
                        individually, memoranda describing what we each thought Soviet reaction
                        would be to a light defense against Soviet missile attack which would cover

                    <p>All of this has been very closely held here. My guess is that the Soviets
                        will take us up on this; but the matter is, of course, urgent because of
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s budget problem.
                        However, the Soviets will be preoccupied with a meeting of the Central
                        Committee and the Supreme Soviet. One of the reasons we went as far as we
                        did was to try to head off any decision they may be making at the Supreme
                        Soviet which will approve their plan for 1967.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your letter of November 17 transmitting a Defense draft <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> on chemical and biological warfare
                            policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">

                        that there are large areas of agreement between your draft and the <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss> paper developed in State<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref target="#d145fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                145</ref>.</note> and previously sent to Defense and other
                        interested agencies. Both drafts are now being studied by members of my
                        staff. After completion of this work, it may be useful to follow up on your
                        suggestion to discuss any remaining issues. You will recall that
                            <persName>Bill Foster</persName> stressed the desirability for
                        developing basic national policy in the <gloss target="#t_CB1">CB</gloss>

                    </list>
                    <p>After an extensive review of the subject, your Science Advisory Committee has
                        recommended in the attached memorandum (Tab A) that the U.S. Government
                        publicly state that it is our policy not to initiate the use of biological
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>This recommendation was made prior to the recent adoption by the U.N. General
                        Assembly (91 in favor including the U.S., 0 against, and 4 abstaining) of a
                        Resolution (Tab B)<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2">Not printed; for text of Part
                            B of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly Resolution 2162

                                Disarmament, 1966</hi>, pp. 798–799.</note> calling for the strict
                        observance by all States of the principles and objectives of the Geneva
                        Protocol of 17 June 1925 on the “Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating,
                        Poisonous and Other Gases and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare.”<note n="3" xml:id="d154fn3">The United States did not ratify this treaty
                            until 1975. For text, see 26 UST 571.</note> This Resolution implicitly
                        associates us with the principle of “no first use” of biological and
                        chemical warfare agents. However, in our statement on the Resolution to the
                        U.N. General Assembly, which made clear that riot control agents and
                        defoliating chemicals are not covered by the Geneva Protocol, we failed to
                        state explicitly what our policy on biological weapons is.<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4">Reference presumably is to the statement by U.S.
                            Representative James M. Nabrit, Jr., on December 5; see <hi rend="italic">Documents on Disarmament, 1966</hi>, pp.
                            800–802.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe that our support of the U.N. Resolution goes a long way toward
                        answering the criticism that the U.S. is the only major power that has not
                        signed the Geneva Protocol and the charge that our use of riot gas and
                        defoliants in Vietnam might escalate into chemical and biological warfare. I
                        am afraid, however, that this improved position could be undercut by our
                        failure to be explicit in stating that it is our policy not to initiate the
                        use of biological weapons.</p>
                    <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0498"/>
                    <p>I understand that you will receive in the next few weeks a petition signed by
                        several thousand scientists relating to our position on chemical and
                        biological warfare.<note n="5" xml:id="d154fn5">See <ref target="#d170">Document 170</ref>.</note> This could be handled with the least
                        fuss and controversy if a prior low-key statement of “no first use” for
                        biological weapons were on the record.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed the problem with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, and they both agree that our public position
                        would be much stronger if we clarified this point.</p>
                    <p>I recommend, therefore, that at a forthcoming press conference, probably in
                        answer to a question, you make a brief statement (Tab C)<note n="6" xml:id="d154fn6">Not printed.</note> on the U.N. Resolution that would
                        set forth explicitly that it is the policy of the United States not to
                        initiate the use of biological warfare weapons. If you concur, I will clear
                        the statement with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Your Science Advisory Committee has reviewed the problem of biological
                            warfare and has concluded that we should formalize our policy of “no
                            first use” of biological weapons. In view of public uncertainty as to
                            our policy in this field and the mounting domestic and international
                            concern regarding the use of biological and chemical weapons, the
                            Committee recommends that, at a suitable opportunity, an official
                            statement be made along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As a matter of policy, the United States has never made military
                                    use of biological weapons and our policy will continue to be not
                                    to use such weapons unless they are first used against us.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>In explaining the use of riot control agents and defoliants in Viet Nam,
                            senior officers of your Administration have made clear that it is
                            against our policy to initiate the use of chemical warfare. There has
                            not, <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0499"/>however, been comparable
                            public statement concerning a policy of “no first use” of biological
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>The United States is the only major power that did not sign the Geneva
                            Protocol of 1925, which essentially proscribed the first use of
                            biological as well as chemical agents. In the absence of a publicly
                            stated position, this leaves us particularly vulnerable to charges that
                            it may be our intention to employ such agents.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of a continuing review over the past few years of the
                            various biological agents, both “lethal” and “non-lethal,” that are
                            presently under study by the Defense Department, your Committee has
                            concluded that the problems associated with these agents appear to
                            outweigh any military advantages that might be attained by their use. In
                            general, the risks associated with these weapons are so great and the
                            uncertainties as to their military effects so large that your Committee
                            believes it extremely unlikely that we would, in fact, consider
                            initiating the use of these weapons in a military conflict.</p>
                        <p>The risk associated with massive use of biological weapons is essentially
                            impossible to predict. In many applications there is the possibility of
                            creating a new focus of endemic infection which might constitute a
                            continuing hazard. In addition, we have scanty experience with the
                            ecological consequences of disturbing the natural biological equilibrium
                            of an area by the introduction of substantial quantities of viable,
                            infectious organisms. Finally, there is at least a theoretical
                            possibility that the use of biological agents on a large scale may
                            result in mutations producing new strains of unusual virulence or even a
                            new form of the disease for which treatment is not available.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we have been presented with no scenarios, nor have we
                            thought of any ourselves, in which the military value seems significant.
                            This applies particularly to the so called incapacitating biological
                            agents which are intended to make the subject very sick without killing
                            him. It is not possible at this time to predict the reliability of any
                            of these agents and some would have significant lethality when applied
                            in massive doses to a large population. There is also considerable
                            uncertainty as to how effective such agents might be in reducing the
                            military potential of enemy forces in an actual combat situation.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, your Science Advisory Committee concludes that a
                            policy of “no first use” of biological weapons is sound and recommends
                            that it would be advantageous to formalize it in a public statement.</p>

                    <p>There are five purposes for which we might want to deploy an anti-ballistic
                        missile system (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>). They are: <list>

                    <p>Today there are three options open to you.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>Do nothing at this time except continue a vigorous research and
                            development program.</item>

                        <item>Deploy a “thick” <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, which
                            would meet Items 1 through 4 and would, in addition, give local
                            protection to 25 selected cities. This option is recommended by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I will discuss each one of these options briefly.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>a.</label>
                        <item>
                            <p>The arguments in favor of Option a are: 1) it is unnecessary now to
                                deploy a system against the Chinese threat because they are 8 to 9
                                years away from having any significant <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability; 2) we have such missile superiority
                                over the Soviet Union with our Polaris submarines which are
                                essentially invulnerable, and our penetration aids for both sea and
                                hardened land-based missiles, that it is unnecessary to protect our
                                land-based strategic forces with an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>; 3) the chance of an accidental missile launching
                                is remote; 4) a blackmail attack is unlikely, because an attacker
                                would know that he was risking all-out nuclear war which would
                                destroy his country; 5) a system designed to protect our cities
                                would ultimately leave us in essentially the same position as we are
                                now vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, because they would be forced to
                                react to preserve their assured destruction capability. In the end,
                                each <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>would have the
                                capacity to kill [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                    not declassified</hi>] and we would have wasted $30 to $40
                                billion.</p>
                            <p>It has been argued that one need only expend about $10 billion to
                                deploy a system which would give protection to 25 selected cities.
                                This argument, however, ignores the fact that if we were to deploy
                                such a system, the Soviet Union would be forced to take
                                countermeasures in the same fashion as we have done. This would
                                require us to thicken our system to meet such countermeasures. In
                                the end, our commitment to defend our cities would force us into
                                deployment of a very thick system at a total cost of between $30 and
                                $40 billion.</p>
                            <p>Further, if we were to deploy a system protecting only 25 cities, the
                                pressures in the Congress would be tremendous to extend such a
                                system to protect other population centers not covered by the $10
                                billion system.</p>
                            <p>Finally, there are still difficult technical problems remaining to be
                                solved, such as the development of the extended range Spartan
                                missile and its associated [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                    source text not declassified</hi>] required for exoatmospheric
                                intercept, the development of the high acceleration Sprint missile
                                for local defense, the development of the very complex radars, and
                                the integration of all of these into a reliable system.</p>
                            <p>The argument against this option is the probable attitude of the
                                Congress and our people. The first reaction of most Americans will
                                inevitably be in favor of an immediate start on deployment, if for
                                no other reason than the Soviets are deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>
                        </item>
                        <label>b.</label>
                        <item>The second option, i.e., to deploy a “thin” system, would meet the
                            first four objectives listed in the first paragraph of this memorandum,
                            probably at a cost of between $4 and $5 billion. It would have to be
                            made clear that this system would not be expanded to attempt to protect
                            our cities against a heavy Soviet attack. This system would not only
                            meet the first four objectives but, for a limited period of time, would
                            also have the side benefit of reducing population losses in the United
                            States against a Soviet attack by 20 or 30 million. This benefit would
                            disappear in time as the Soviets improved their missiles—as we have
                            done—by the development of penetration aids and multiple warheads. If
                            this option were chosen, the deployment decision could be coupled with
                            talks with the Soviet Union, seeking to reach an understanding with
                            respect to the further deployment of both <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s and offensive missiles. A decision in favor of this
                            option would draw the teeth of much of the argument that the Soviets
                            have a defense and we do not. However, there would be continuing
                            pressures from some sources to expand to a “thick” system.</item>
                        <label>c.</label>
                        <item>
                            <p>The third option would, as indicated above, deploy a system designed
                                to meet the first four objectives and to protect 25 selected cities.
                                    <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0502"/>The Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff have recommended that you decide in favor of this option. For
                                the reasons given above, this would not produce a stable situation
                                because the Soviet Union would be forced to react and thus would
                                negate the effectiveness of the system. In the end, we would spend
                                $30 to $40 billion in thickening this system, and would not be able
                                to protect our country from devastation from a Soviet missile
                                attack.</p>
                            <p>The Congress is divided on the issue of deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, but we believe that a
                                substantial majority favor going ahead with some form of deployment.
                                The group in favor of proceeding with an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment is led by Senator
                                    <persName>Russell</persName> and has strong backing in the Armed

                    <p>The following is a rather hasty paper. I hope, over the weekend, to put
                        something more thoughtful together.</p>
                    <p>A key question is whether the Russians consider that we are responding to a
                        large-scale deployment on their part, or whether they see us as escalating
                        the competition.</p>
                    <p>The analysis shown to us <hi rend="italic">assumes</hi> that a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment is under way. Now, while there
                        is little doubt that the Moscow system is an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, there is a real question whether the Tallinn system
                        which is being deployed rapidly (23 sites as of 12/7/66) is for air defense
                        or <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> use. The most recent <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> (10–26–66)<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">Not
                            further identified.</note> concludes that it is probably an air <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0503"/>defense system, although it may
                        have marginal <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities. All of the
                        people I have had look at the problem (the <gloss target="#t_PSAC1">PSAC</gloss> Reconnaissance Panel, Chairman Dr. <persName>Edwin
                            Land</persName>, and Strategic Offense and Defense Panel, Chairman Dr.
                            <persName>Marvin Goldberger</persName>) concur in this view (but <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> does not).</p>
                    <p>The essence of the problem is that the radars at the Tallinn sites are too
                        small to give an area capability unless early warning and acquisition are
                        performed by the Hen House radars at distant locations. But (1) the large
                        Hen House radars are soft and undefended, and (2) some of the sites are not
                        covered by Hen House radars; e.g. the last three discovered are too far
                        East. If not used in conjunction with Hen House radars, this is a point
                        defense system with a radius of coverage of about 30–200 miles. In that
                        case, some of them are very poorly sited, e.g. one on a peninsula in the
                        Crimea (Feodosiya) which would largely defend water, although it is
                        excellently sited to bar intrusion by aircraft.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I conclude that it would be incorrect to proceed from the
                        assumption that a general deployment is underway in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and we must take into account the
                        possibility that the Soviets do not see themselves as having initiated one.
                        In this case they would regard the deployment of a general system—even a
                        “thin” one—if undertaken on anything like a crash basis as a new threat to
                        their deterrence and would react strongly to it.</p>
                    <p>One might note, though, that for this same reason they might react favorably
                        to proposals to mutually limit <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployments on a mutual example basis.</p>
                    <p>In judging possible Soviet reaction, one cannot underestimate the extent to
                        which they apparently feel themselves “under the gun.” My basis for saying
                        that is that I am possibly the only American who has recently spoken
                        directly to Marshal Malinovsky, the Minister of Defense (November 7,
                            1964)<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">No other record of this conversation
                            has been found.</note> and who has seen the reddening of his face when
                        he says, “Your Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thinks
                        he can overwhelm us with his thousands of rockets.” For this reason I see
                        their increased hard missile deployment rate as an effort to catch up and
                        eliminate the threat of a first strike by us. I suspect they are keenly
                        aware of our advantage in both missiles and aircraft and would react as
                        strongly as they could if their deterrence were threatened.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, if we are to have any hope of stabilizing a race which in the
                        end poses increasingly serious threats to both sides and becomes
                        increasingly expensive, it seems unwise to start down a new road unless: (1)
                        there is better evidence than we have now that we face a new threat, (2) <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>the deployment would give us a real
                        military advantage (which it appears not to), (3) it can be done in a way
                        which minimizes the provocation or new challenge unless there is reason to
                        believe that the pressure would produce a “truce.”</p>
                    <p>For all these reasons, I would continue to delay a deployment decision until
                        the diplomatic possibilities have been more thoroughly explored and the
                        intelligence has improved. If this is not practicable, I would start slowly
                        on an experimental basis with a “thin” system—for the additional reason that
                        there are still many technical problems to be solved before a sensible
                        system can be put together.</p>
                    <p>One other factor should also be considered. Some will argue that the
                        continued engagement of their technical talent in these areas will
                        impoverish the civilian economy. The effect might be the reverse—that by
                        being forced to work on priority problems of the greatest technical
                        sophistication they will acquire a higher technological capacity than they
                        would otherwise achieve—if fewer cars, consumer goods, etc. There is reason
                        to believe that although their technology definitely lags ours in
                        substantially all areas, their relative position may be improving (e.g. as
                        shown by a comparison of their radars or aircraft with ours in 1950 and in
                        1966). I think it is clear that their best engineering, quality production
                        and management is in the defense industries. But I have seen first hand that
                        there is no shortage of highly trained scientists and engineers in the
                        non-defense area (they train twice as many as we do). I have also noted that
                        key people in science (e.g. Keldysh, President of the Academy), in the
                        electronics, computer and communications industry have a defense or military
                        background. Hence, one can hypothesize that there may in fact be a strong
                        “spin off” such as we ascribe to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend deployment of the Nike-X to protect our
                        population against a Soviet attack. The initial system is estimated to cost
                        $10 billion with $800 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′68. This
                        system would be designed to provide a light area defense of the Continental
                        United States <hi rend="italic">and a local defense of 25 selected
                            cities</hi>. The Joint Chiefs would preserve the option to expand the
                        local defense system to 50 selected cities at an estimated cost of $20
                        billion using present cost factors. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>
                        believe that because of the usual cost under-estimation and engineering
                        changes to overcome defects in systems tests, the necessary redesign to
                        overcome Soviet countermeasures, the eventual cost of such a program would
                        reach $30 to $40 billion.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> recommend against the deployment
                        recommended by the Joint Chiefs because they believe the Soviets will take
                        the necessary countermeasures to overcome our system just as we are doing to
                        overcome theirs. They believe that ultimately the Soviet Union and the
                        United States will end up in the same position after the unnecessary
                        expenditure of millions of dollars. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName>
                        believe that if any <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system is to be
                        deployed, it should be a “light” deployment, specifically and exclusively
                        designed to satisfy the following four purposes.</p>

                        achieve an initial operational capability in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974. The Secretary of the Air Force estimates the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′68 cost at $47 million, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67–72 cost at $1.2 billion and the total
                        development cost at $1.5 billion (production costs are not included in these
                        figures and would add several billions). General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> has stated that he is not

                    <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> recommend $26 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′68 for continuation of component

                        to obtain a firm contractor proposal for system development because they do
                        not believe an initial operational capability in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974 is needed. They further believe it is doubtful we will
                        need a new manned bomber because of difficulties associated with penetration
                        of the Soviet Union in the mid and late 1970s. In addition, they believe
                        that missiles, plus the FB–111 force which the United States will have at
                        that time will be enough to meet our force requirements. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> point out that the monies to be expended on engine and
                        avionics development will give us an engine and avionics that could be used
                        for other aircraft and therefore believe that the expenditure of such funds
                        is wise and prudent.</p>

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend $36 million of <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> funds in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′68 for
                        development of a propulsion and guidance system to meet a 1973 initial
                        operational capability date. The $36 million would be broken down into $10
                        million for component development and the balance for contract definition.
                        The Secretary of the Air Force would not go to contract definition but would
                        spend $19 million for component development.</p>

                        be desirable after review next summer. They see no need for an initial
                        operational capability in 1973. At the recent meeting in Austin General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> stated that the Joint

                        Army divisions and 4 active Marine divisions. The Chief of Staff of the Army
                        would add 30,000 men to the active Army now, and possibly an additional
                        45,000 in March or April of 1967, to provide 2 additional brigades now and a
                        whole division later in the active Army. The equipment for these forces
                        would be borrowed from similar units in the Reserves. The purpose of this
                        plan, as explained by the Chief of Staff of the Army, would be to reduce the

                        in 1967, and the construction of two guided missile destroyers (<gloss target="#t_DDG1">DDG</gloss>) in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                        for $167 million. Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>

                        They point out that the latter will provide us with one nuclear-powered

                        recommend against the 1968 <gloss target="#t_DLGN1">DLGN</gloss> because
                        they believe one nuclear escort per nuclear carrier is enough. The Chief of

                                <p>There is nothing I have seen in either our own or the Soviet
                                    Union’s technology which would lead me to believe we cannot do
                                    this. From the beginning of the Nike-Zeus project in 1955
                                    through the end of this current fiscal year, we will have
                                    invested a total of about $4 billion on ballistic missile
                                    defense research—including Nike-Zeus, Nike-X and Project
                                    Defender. And, during the last five or six years, we have spent
                                    about $1.2 billion on the development of penetration aids to
                                    help ensure that our missiles could penetrate the enemy’s
                                    defenses. As a result of these efforts, we have the technology
                                    already in hand to counter any defensive force changes the
                                    Soviet Union is likely to undertake in the foreseeable
                                    future.</p>
                                <p>We believe the Soviet Union has essentially the same requirement
                                    for a deterrent or “Assured Destruction” force as the U.S.
                                    Therefore, deployment by the U.S. of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense which would degrade the destruction
                                    capability of the Soviet’s offensive force to an unacceptable
                                    level would lead to the expansion of that force. In that event,
                                    we would be no better off than we were before.</p>

                        SS–11s; we now estimate that they will have 130–140 SS–9s and 320–400 SS–11s

                    </p>
                    <p>By mid-1971, we believe they could have a total of 800–1100 operational
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s on launchers, compared with last
                        year’s estimate of 500–800 by mid-1970. We believe the higher end of the
                        range of estimates will prevail if the Soviets decide to emphasize quantity
                        in an effort to match the size of our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force, and the lower end if they choose to emphasize quality. In the first
                        case, they would concentrate on the SS–11 which is a relatively simple and
                        cheap missile. In the second case, they would place added emphasis on the
                        SS–9 which is a more expensive and also, for certain purposes, a much more
                        effective missile. The SS–11 because of its relatively poor <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> and small payload would have little value
                        against hard targets such as our Minuteman silos, and it is therefore
                        essentially a retaliatory weapon for use against cities. <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0513"/>The Soviets also have some older <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s but these are already being phased out
                        and few are expected to be left in the operational force by 1971.</p>
                    <p>Although we still have no direct evidence of such an effort, the Soviets
                        might also develop and install multiple independently-aimed reentry vehicles
                            (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) on their SS–9s. However, an
                        effective capability with such reentry vehicles would require much greater
                        accuracies (lower <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss>s) than have thus far
                        been achieved by Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s. If they were
                        to start now, they could probably achieve an operational capability by about
                        1971–72; and we would probably be able to detect the testing of such a
                        system perhaps two years earlier. Improvements in both accuracy and
                        penetration capability could also be made in the SS–11s, and in addition the
                        Soviets might deploy a new solid fuel, highly accurate small <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>We have known for some time that the Soviet Union was working on
                        anti-ballistic missile defense. After several false starts, the Soviets now
                        appear to be deploying one type of system (which is definitely designed for
                        ballistic missile defense) around Moscow and another type of system,
                        designated “Tallinn”, (which may be designed for defense against manned
                        bombers, or ballistic missiles, or both) across the northwest approaches to
                        the Soviet Union and at a few other locations.</p>
                    <p>The Moscow system appears to consist of a series of complexes deployed at
                        some of the outer ring SA–1 sites, about 45 n.mi. from the center of the
                        city. Each complex has two “Triads” (one large and two small radars
                        operating together) and 16 launchers apparently designed for the “Galosh”
                        missile which the Soviets displayed in 1964. (Six complexes are under active
                        construction and a seventh is now dormant.) In addition, there is a large
                        phased-array radar southwest of Moscow (called Dog House) oriented towards
                        our <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat corridor and additional
                        large phased-array radars (called Hen House) sited at two locations to the
                        northwest. These three radars may be intended as forward acquisition radars
                        for the Moscow system, while the Triad radars handle the target and
                        interceptor missile tracking functions. The Moscow system could have an
                        initial operational capability in 1967 or early 1968, and a full operational
                        capability with six complexes (96 launchers) by 1970–71. (By that time the
                        Soviets could also construct two more complexes to fill out the southern
                        part of the ring, for a total of 128 launchers.)</p>
                    <p>The Galosh itself is a large, relatively slow acceleration missile probably
                        designed for exoatmospheric interception much like our new extended range
                        interceptor missile, which we now call “Spartan”. We have no evidence thus
                        far of a Soviet terminal defense missile such as our Sprint. If used for
                        both area and terminal defense, the Galosh system would be very expensive,
                        at least $15 million per missile on launcher <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0514"/>(dividing the total investment cost by the number of
                        missiles on launchers) where only 16 missiles are provided per complex. Even
                        if two reload missiles were provided for each launcher, the cost per missile
                        would still amount to about $6 million. But there is a real question whether
                        the reloading speed of the Galosh (now estimated at 10–30 minutes after
                        arrival of the missile at the launcher) would be fast enough to be of any
                        use in a single engagement. Similarly, there is a question whether a single
                        Triad, the radars of which are mechanically steered, could handle more than
                        eight launchers. (We ourselves have abandoned this type of radar for <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense because of its grave
                        limitations.)</p>
                    <p>With regard to the second defensive system, there is still disagreement
                        within our Intelligence Community as to its primary purpose. One view is
                        that it is primarily an advanced surface-to-air missile system designed
                        against high altitude, high speed manned bomber attacks, and the pattern in
                        which it is being deployed, the configuration of the sites and their
                        equipment, and the characteristics of the radars, all lend credence to this
                        view. Several “farms” of missile launchers are located in a barrier line
                        across the northwestern part of European Russia and around Leningrad and
                        Moscow, and some parts of the southern approaches. At least 22 complexes
                        have been definitely identified, most of which consist of three launch
                        sites, each with six launch positions and one radar. These could be
                        operational by 1967–68, and more may be under construction. The local radars
                        associated with the launchers are of limited capability and would appear to
                        need the support of the much larger but vulnerable Hen House radars if the
                        system is expected to perform with a reasonable degree of effectiveness in
                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> role.</p>
                    <p>If it is indeed designed as an advanced surface-to-air, anti-aircraft
                        missile, it would be most effective in defending against high-altitude
                        penetrating bombers of the B–70 or SR–71 type; it would be ineffective
                        against low-altitude penetrating bombers such as the B–52 or FB–111. It is
                        this incongruity, together with the fact that this type of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would be much cheaper than the
                        Galosh, which leads the proponents of the other point of view to believe
                        that it is an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, or at least has
                        some minimal <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability. And while we
                        know something about the geographical deployments of this system, and about
                        its launchers and radars, we still know very little about the interceptor
                        missile itself.</p>

                        11–3–66) concludes “ … that the Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>

                        the Moscow area by currently operational missiles, but that its capabilities
                        could be degraded by advanced penetration systems and it could not cope with
                        a very heavy attack. Moreover, <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0515"/>the
                        present deployment will not cover all of the multi-directional Polaris

                            <p>“Many of the Tallinn system complexes are so located that presently

                        development program, the Nike-Zeus was begun in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955. Up until the launching of the Sputnik <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0516"/>in October 1957, the project proceeded at a
                        leisurely pace. Congressional attitudes towards the program ranged from
                        incredulousness regarding its operational feasibility (especially in view of
                        the problems then being encountered in anti-bomber defense) to concern over
                        a new “roles and missions” fight between the Army (Zeus) and the Air Force
                        (Wizard).</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of Sputnik a new sense of urgency developed with regard to
                        all aspects of advanced military technology. From <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1955 through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957, a total
                        of only $12.2 million was applied to Nike-Zeus <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> but in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958 alone the
                        total rose to $66 million and in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959, to
                        $237 million. By the spring of 1958, when the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1959 Budget was before the Congress, the Army had already
                        proposed the production of initial sets of equipment. Secretary of Defense
                        McElroy, however, argued that “we should not spend hundreds of millions on
                        production of this weapon pending general confirmatory indications that we
                        know what we are doing.” His view prevailed for the moment.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1960 Budget that
                        Nike-Zeus deployment became a real issue. The Army’s initial request
                        included $875 million for Zeus—$35 million for <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>, $720 million for procurement and $115 million for
                        construction. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>,
                        however, sent to the Congress a request of $300 million for <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> and test facilities only. The House
                        Appropriations Committee recommended the addition of $200 million “for the
                        acceleration of the Nike-Zeus and/or the modernization of Army firepower.”
                        Secretary McElroy agreed to accept $137 million for the acceleration of
                        Nike-Zeus and $63 million for Army modernization. The Senate approved these
                        amounts and added $200 million more for Army modernization. The final
                        enactment provided $375 million for Nike-Zeus and/or Army modernization.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1959, in connection with the development of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 Budget, the Army proposed a new
                        Nike-Zeus deployment plan consisting of 35 local defense centers (one for
                        each defended area), 9 forward acquisition radars and 120 batteries. The
                        typical battery was to consist of 50 missiles on launchers and 16 radars, a
                        missile-to-radar ratio very close to that of the current Soviet Galosh
                        system. An initial operational capability was to be achieved by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 and the entire program completed by
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969, with a total investment cost
                        estimated at $13 to $14 billion, of which $1.5 billion would be required in
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961.</p>
                    <p>The system was designed around a relatively slow speed and limited range
                        interceptor missile and mechanically steered radars. Because of the
                        missile’s slow speed, it had to be fired long before the incoming target
                        reentered the atmosphere, thereby precluding the use of the atmosphere as a
                        means of distinguishing real warheads from other objects such as decoys or
                        tankage fragments; and the limited range of the missile reduced the
                        potential kill radius. (Indeed, the plan called for <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0517"/>the firing of three Zeus against each
                        attacking <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>.) Because the radars were
                        mechanically steered (like the local Galosh radars), the traffic-handling
                        capabilities of the system were low, leaving it vulnerable to saturation
                        attacks.</p>
                    <p>This plan was rejected by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>, who pointed out in his <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 Budget message that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Nike-Zeus system is one of the most difficult undertakings ever
                                attempted by this country. The technical problems involved in

                    <p>The weaknesses in the Nike-Zeus system led in 1961 and 1962 to the
                        development of a new and different system known as Nike-X. To help solve the
                        problem of discriminating actual warheads from decoys and other objects, a
                        new, high acceleration terminal defense missile, the Sprint, was designed.
                        Because of its fast reaction time, this missile would permit the defense to
                        wait until the enemy attack penetrated well into the atmosphere where the
                        lighter objects, such as unsophisticated decoys, would be separated from the
                        warheads, thus permitting the defense to concentrate more of its fire on the
                        latter. To solve the problem of limited handling capacity, a new family of
                        phased-array radars was developed. These radars employ a relatively new
                        principle; instead of scanning the skies with an electronic beam by
                        mechanically rotating the entire radar structure, the structure is covered
                        with thousands of sensors and is kept stationary while the electronic beam
                        does the rotating. Because an electronic beam can be rotated a million times
                        faster than a mechanical structure, the phased-array radar has a far greater
                        search and tracking capacity. In other words, it can simultaneously handle
                        many more incoming objects, thus eliminating one of the major limitations of
                        the old Nike-Zeus system.</p>
                    <p>With the phased-array radar and Sprint missiles, the defense battery could
                        bring firepower to bear on all targets entering an area 20 miles high and 25
                        miles in radius. However, even if these batteries were deployed around all
                        our major cities, a large part of the nation would <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0518"/>still be left undefended and the attacker
                        would have the option of ground-bursting his warheads outside the defended
                        areas, thus producing vast amounts of lethal fall-out which could be carried
                        by the winds over the defended areas. Moreover, a terminal (or local)
                        defense compels the defender to allocate his resources in advance, leaving
                        the attacker free to concentrate his resources against whatever targets he
                        may choose at the moment of the attack.</p>
                    <p>To fill in this gap, we initiated in the spring of 1965 the development of a
                        new long-range interceptor with a high yield, high temperature X-ray
                        warhead. This missile, the Spartan, is designed to reach out over 400
                        nautical miles from its launcher and attack incoming objects at altitudes of
                        up to 280 nautical miles. Its warhead is to be capable of destroying
                        ballistic missile reentry vehicles at ranges of five to ten miles if they
                        are hardened, and 10 to 100 miles if they are not. About a dozen properly
                        located batteries of such a missile could provide some coverage over the
                        entire United States. Together with the Sprint, it could provide a defense
                        in depth, permitting all incoming objects to be attacked first well above
                        the atmosphere and then the surviving objects a second time as they enter
                        the atmosphere. Moreover, by overlapping the coverage of the Spartan
                        batteries, some of the attacker’s inherent advantage against terminal
                        defenses alone could be overcome, since the defender at the moment of the
                        attack would also have the choice of concentrating his resources over those
                        targets he chooses to protect.</p>
                    <p>The deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system did not
                        become a serious issue again until earlier this year. It was clear to us
                        from the beginning, i.e., 1961, that the Nike-Zeus as then conceived would
                        not be an effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system against the
                        type of ballistic missile attack the Soviets would be able to launch by the
                        end of the decade. Accordingly, both in President Kennedy’s and your
                        administrations, we have steadfastly maintained that the development of a
                        more effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system should be pursued
                        on an urgent basis but that no production or deployment should be undertaken
                        until much more was known about the system’s technical capabilities and its
                        likely effect on the strategic situation generally. This view found
                        substantial support within the Executive Branch and in the Congress up until
                        recently, although an abortive attempt was made by some members of the
                        Senate in 1963 to authorize an appropriation for the deployment of the
                        Nike-Zeus. However, in acting on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967
                        Defense Budget, the Armed Services Committees and the Defense Appropriations
                        Subcommittees of both Houses recommended, and the Congress appropriated,
                        about $168 million to prepare for the production of the Nike-X system. It
                        is, therefore, clear that the deployment of this system will be a major
                        issue in the next session of the Congress.</p>

                        different types of phased-array radars and two types of interceptor
                        missiles, which could be deployed in a variety of configurations: <list>

                                functions involved in engaging a large, sophisticated attack:
                                central control and battle management, long-range search,
                                acquisition of the target, discrimination of warheads from decoys or
                                “spoofing” devices, precision tracking of the target, and control of

                                can perform all the basic defense functions in a smaller, less

                                involved in area defense. To achieve the full potential of the
                                extended-range Spartan, the target must be picked up at much greater
                                distances in order to compute its trajectory before the Spartan is
                                fired.</item>

                                interceptor missiles during an engagement. It can also perform the
                                functions of the TACMAR but on a considerably reduced scale.
                                Actually, a number of different sizes are being studied. This
                                “modular” approach will permit us to tailor the capacity of the
                                radar to the particular needs of each defended area.</item>

                                5,000 and 100,000 feet at a range of 25 miles.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to these major elements of the system, an entire new
                        infrastructure, including base facilities, communications, logistics
                        support, etc., will be required. The exact cost of this infrastructure
                        cannot be determined until a specific deployment plan is decided upon, but
                        it would surely be substantial for any deployment.</p>
                    <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0520"/>
                    <p>The technical principles involved in the radars are now fairly well
                        established. One <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_MAR1">MAR</gloss>-type radar has been constructed at the
                        White Sands Missile Range. A contract has been let for the power plant of a
                        second <gloss target="#t_MAR1">MAR</gloss>-type radar, which is to be
                        constructed on Kwajalein Atoll. The Missile Site Radar is well along in
                        development and the construction of one of these radars on Kwajalein Atoll
                        has also begun.</p>
                    <p>Testing of the Sprint missile was started at White Sands in November 1965
                        with one complete success, two partial successes and three failures. The
                        failures are attributed mostly to insufficient quality control but some of
                        the missile’s components may have to be redesigned. The tempo of testing
                        will steadily increase during the current fiscal year and we are advised by
                        our technical people that the missile will eventually reach its design
                        goals. The nuclear warhead is also well along in development and does not
                        appear to present any particular problem.</p>
                    <p>The Spartan is still on the drawing boards. It represents a very substantial
                        redesign of the original Nike-Zeus and we will not know until it is flight
                        tested a year and a half hence how well it will perform. However, we are
                        less concerned with the missile itself than we are with its warhead. A
                        significant number of development tests will have to be performed, all
                        underground, before the design parameters can be established; and then we
                        will have to proof test the resulting warhead, again underground. (The
                        feasibility of a full yield test underground has still to be established,
                        but it may be possible to use a scaled-down test.) Accordingly, there is
                        still considerable technical uncertainty concerning the warhead. Although
                        alternative warheads could be used on the Spartan, they would be less
                        effective against a heavy, sophisticated attack.</p>
                    <p>Facilities for testing both the Sprint and the Spartan will be constructed on
                        Kwajalein Atoll. These, together with the TACMAR and <gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss> and the programs for the computers will give us all of the
                        major elements of the Nike-X system which are essential to test its overall
                        performance against reentry vehicles fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
                        California. (We feel we know enough about the <gloss target="#t_PAR1">PAR</gloss> technology to be able to use the mechanically steered
                        radars already on Kwajalein as simulators.) The system will be tested in
                        stages, starting with the <gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss> and Sprint
                        tests in January 1969, then the Spartan missile in July 1969 and the TACMAR
                        radar between July and December 1970. Upwards of 100 test shots will be
                        launched from Vandenberg to Kwajalein during the period 1969–72 to test the
                        system thoroughly as a whole. The most important objective of this effort is
                        to determine proper system integration and computer programming, since the
                        individual components of the system will have already been tested ahead of
                        time.</p>

                    <p>But even after this elaborate test program is completed, a number of
                        technical uncertainties will still remain unresolved. Chief among these are
                        the following:</p>

                        <item>Large Sophisticated Attacks. Notwithstanding the number of test shots
                            planned, the ability of the system to cope with a large sophisticated
                            attack will still remain to be demonstrated, except to the extent that
                            such attacks can be simulated in the computers.</item>

                        <item>Discrimination of Decoys and Other “Spoofing” Devices. Although the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAR1">MAR</gloss>-type radars are specifically
                            designed to deal with this problem, discrimination will always remain an
                            unresolved issue. We have been studying and developing such devices for
                            many years and we are now installing some of them in our offensive
                            missiles. No doubt new devices and the counters to them will be invented
                            in the future, and the contest between the offense and the defense will
                            continue as it has in the area of manned bombers.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>
                            <p>Blackout. Detonation of nuclear devices high in the atmosphere can
                                seriously degrade the effectiveness of the defense’s radars. These
                                detonations can be either the defensive warheads (self blackout) or
                                deliberate explosions of the incoming warheads (precursor blackout).
                                They have the effect of producing an area in the atmosphere similar
                                to an opaque cloud which the radars cannot see into or through. The
                                size of the area is a function of how high the burst occurs and of
                                the frequency of the radars. The blacked-out region is larger at
                                higher altitudes and appears larger to lower frequency radars. At
                                the lower altitudes, the blackout region is essentially the visible
                                fireball. For the terminal defenses employing Sprint missiles in the
                                lower atmosphere and radars in the microwave region (about 1200
                                megacycles), the blackout effects can be minimized and are well
                                understood from previous testing.</p>
                            <p>For the area defense the problem is more severe. For one thing, the
                                number of tests conducted by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union at
                                the altitudes of interest for area defense (above 200,000 feet) is
                                relatively small. In the U.S. tests, the data collected are not
                                complete enough to answer all the technical issues, although our
                                continuing study of the available data is increasing our knowledge
                                of the blackout effects. However, we can never resolve all the
                                uncertainties with the existing data. We know there will be blackout
                                effects and we know that we can choose a radar frequency and
                                proliferate radars to minimize them. But we do not know how many
                                precursor nuclear blasts the Soviets would have to place over the
                                United States to black out our radars. And, we do not know how much
                                they learned from their nuclear tests. Consequently, we do not know
                                precisely what their uncertainties would be in using this as an
                                offensive tactic. We do know that the blackout effects can be offset
                                by raising the frequencies of the radars, and we are <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0522"/>doing this in the case of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PAR1">PAR</gloss>. However, because the area
                                defense radars must detect small targets at long ranges and because
                                the price of a radar set operating in this manner increases with the
                                frequency, there is a limit on how far we can go in this direction
                                to counter blackout.</p>

                        <item>Programming the Computers. The management of a sophisticated ballistic
                            missile attack engagement presents an extremely complex problem. To
                            control the phased-array radars and guide the missile, powerful
                            computers and sophisticated “programs” are needed. The size of the
                            computer varies with the type of radar. For the area defense (with
                                <gloss target="#t_PAR1">PAR</gloss>), computer speeds and capacities
                            equivalent to the best of today’s commercial computers are adequate. The
                                <gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MAR1">MAR</gloss> will need much more powerful computers, development of
                            which has been underway since 1962. However, it is not the computer
                            itself which is our major concern, but rather the production of the
                            “programs” which must be designed in advance to reflect every
                            conceivable eventuality the system may confront. Our experience in
                            programming the <gloss target="#t_SAGE1">SAGE</gloss> computers against
                            manned bomber attacks has revealed some of the complexities, and the
                            costs, of such an undertaking. Whether we can provide for all of the
                            variables involved in such a vastly more complex problem as anti-missile
                            defense has yet to be demonstrated. Here, again, we will have a much
                            better idea of what is actually involved in programming the computers
                            when the prototype system on Kwajalein is demonstrated in the 1970–72
                            period.</item>

                        <item>Production and Operational Problems. We have learned from bitter
                            experience that even when the development problems have been solved, a
                            system can run into trouble in production or when it is put into
                            operation. All too often the development prototype cannot be produced in
                            quantity without extensive re-engineering. Production delays are
                            encountered and costs begin to spiral. Sometimes these problems are not
                            discovered until the new system actually enters the inventory and has to
                            function in an operational environment. The Terrier, Talos, and Tartar
                            ship-to-air missiles are a good example; after spending about $2 billion
                            on development and production of these missiles, we had to spend another
                            $350 million correcting the faults of those already installed and we
                            still plan to spend another $550 million modernizing these
                            systems.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>In this connection, it is worth noting that had we produced and deployed the
                        Nike-Zeus system proposed by the Army in 1959 at an estimated cost of $13 to
                        $14 billion, most of it would have had to be torn out and replaced, almost
                        before it became operational, by the new missiles and radars of the Nike-X
                        system. By the same token, other technological developments in offensive
                        forces over the next seven years may make obsolete or drastically degrade
                        the Nike-X system as presently envisioned. We can predict with certainty
                        that there will be substantial additional costs for updating any system we
                        might consider installing at this time against the Soviet missile
                        threat.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">4. Assuming the Nike-X System is Technically Feasible,
                            Should it Be Deployed Now?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>This question can be answered only within the context of the general nuclear
                        war problem as a whole and our overall national security objectives. For
                        many years the overriding objective of our national policy with regard to
                        general nuclear war has been to deter the Soviet Union (or any other nation)
                        from launching a surprise nuclear attack against us or our Allies. As long
                        as that remains our overriding objective, the capability for “Assured
                        Destruction” must receive first call on all of our resources and must be
                        provided regardless of the cost and the difficulties involved. Programs
                        designed to limit damage to our population and industrial capacity in the
                        event the deterrent fails can never substitute for an “Assured Destruction”
                        capability in this context, no matter how much we spend on them. It is our
                        ability to destroy the attacker as a viable 20th century nation that
                        provides the deterrent, not the ability to limit damage to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>What kind and amount of destruction we would have to be able to inflict on an
                        attacker to provide this deterrent cannot be answered precisely. However, it
                        seems reasonable to assume that in the case of the Soviet Union, the
                        destruction of, say, [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Such a level of destruction would certainly
                        represent intolerable punishment to any industrialized nation and thus
                        should serve as an effective deterrent to the deliberate initiation of a
                        nuclear attack on the United States or its Allies.</p>
                    <p>Once sufficient forces have been procured to give us high confidence of
                        achieving our “Assured Destruction” objective, we can then consider the
                        kinds and amounts of forces which might be added to reduce damage to our
                        population and industry in the event deterrence fails. But here we must note
                        another important point, namely, the possible interaction of our strategic
                        forces programs with those of the Soviet Union. If the general nuclear war
                        policy of the Soviet Union also has as its objective the deterrence of a
                        U.S. first strike (which I believe to be the case), then we must assume that
                        any attempt on our part to reduce damage to ourselves (below what they would
                        estimate we would consider “unacceptable levels”) would put pressure on them
                        to strive for an offsetting improvement in their deterrent forces.
                        Conversely, an increase in their “Damage Limiting” capability would require
                        us to make greater investments in “Assured Destruction”, which, as noted
                        earlier in this memorandum, is precisely what we are now doing. It is in
                        this context that we should examine the desirability of increasing our
                        “Damage Limiting” capabilities against a heavy, sophisticated Soviet attack
                        in the 1970s.</p>
                    <p>As I noted earlier, the major elements of the Nike-X system, as they are now
                        being developed, would permit a variety of deployments; two <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0524"/>have been selected for the purposes of this
                        analysis. The first, which I will call “Posture-A”, represents a light U.S.
                        defense against a Soviet missile attack on our cities. It consists of an
                        area defense of the entire continental United States, providing redundant
                        (overlapping) coverage of key target areas; and, in addition, a relatively
                        low-density Sprint defense of the 25 largest cities to provide some
                        protection against those warheads which get through the area defense.<note n="13" xml:id="d160fn13">This is essentially the deployment now
                            recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [Footnote in the source
                            text.]</note> The second deployment, which I call “Posture B”, is a
                        heavier defense against a Soviet attack. With the same area coverage, it
                        provides a higher-density Sprint defense for the 50 largest cities.</p>

                    <p>In addition, if technically feasible, we would have to provide some
                        improvement in our defense against manned bomber attack in order to preclude
                        the Soviets from undercutting the Nike-X defense; we would also want to
                        accelerate the fallout shelter program. The investment cost (including
                            <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>) of the former is estimated at
                        about $1.5 to $2.4 billion and would provide for a small force of F–111 or
                        F–12 type interceptors (e.g., 48 F–111s or 32 F–12s) and about 42 aircraft
                        warning and control aircraft (<gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss>). With
                        the introduction of these new types of aircraft, we might be able to phase
                        out most of the present interceptor aircraft and a large part of the
                        ground-based aircraft warning and control network, thus producing an actual
                        saving in operating costs over the longer term. The expanded fallout shelter
                        program would cost about $800 million more than the one we are now pursuing.
                        We would also need some of our anti-submarine warfare forces for use against
                        Soviet missile submarines, but we are not yet clear whether these <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces would actually have to be increased
                        over the currently planned levels. In any event, the “current” estimates of
                        the investment cost of the total “Damage Limiting” package would amount to
                        at least $10.5 billion for Posture A and at least $20 billion for Posture B
                        (“final” costs for each of these Postures would probably be 50 to 100
                        percent higher).<note n="14" xml:id="d160fn14">Even before the systems
                            became operational, pressures would mount for their expansion at a cost
                            of still additional billions. The unprotected, or relatively
                            unprotected, areas of the U.S. (e.g., Alaska, Tampa, Birmingham,
                            Sacramento) would claim that their tax dollars were being diverted to
                            protect New York and Washington while they were left naked. And, critics
                            would point out that our strategic offensive force is premised on a much
                            larger Soviet threat (the “possible”, not the “probable” threat); they
                            would conclude that the same principles should be applied to our
                            strategic defensive forces. For these and other reasons, I believe that,
                            once started, an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system deployed
                            with the objective of protecting the United States against the Soviet
                            Union would require an expenditure on the order of $40 billion over a
                            ten year period. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>

                    <p>To test the contribution that each of these Nike-X deployments might make to
                        our “Damage Limiting” objectives, we have projected both the U.S. and Soviet
                        strategic nuclear forces (assuming no reaction by the Soviets to the U.S.

                    <p>The first case, “Soviets Strike First, U.S. Retaliates”, is the threat
                        against which our strategic forces must be designed. The second case, “U.S.
                        Strikes First, Soviets Retaliate”, is the case that would determine the size
                        and character of the Soviet reaction to changes in our strategic forces, if
                        they wish, as clearly they do, to maintain an “Assured Destruction”
                        capability against us.</p>
                    <p>These calculations indicate that without Nike-X and the other “Damage
                        Limiting” programs discussed earlier, U.S. fatalities from a Soviet first
                        strike could total about 100 million; even after absorbing that attack, we
                        could inflict on the Soviet Union about [<hi rend="italic">number not
                            declassified</hi>] fatalities. Assuming the Soviets do not react to our
                        deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense against them,
                        which is a most unrealistic assumption, Posture A might reduce our
                        fatalities to 15 million and Posture B, to about 10 million.</p>
                    <p>Although the fatality estimates shown for both the Soviet Union and the U.S.
                        reflect some variations in the performance of their respective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems, they are still based on the
                        assumption that these systems will work at relatively high levels of
                        efficiency. (In fact, for the purpose of these calculations we have assumed
                        that the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system will be just as
                        good as the Nike-X, even though we believe the system, or systems, which
                        they are now deploying are, in fact, far inferior.) If these <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems do not perform as well as our
                        technical people postulate, fatalities on both sides could be considerably
                        higher than shown in the table above, or the costs would be considerably
                        higher if major improvements or additions had to be made in the systems to
                        bring them up to the postulated level of performance.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets are determined to maintain an “Assured Destruction” capability
                        against us and they believe that our deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0528"/>defense would reduce our fatalities
                        in the “U.S. Strikes First, Soviets Retaliate” case to the levels shown in
                        the table above, they would have no alternative but to increase the second
                        strike damage potential of their offensive forces. They could do so in
                        several different ways: by deploying a new large, land-based <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> (either mobile, or hardened and
                        defended), or a new submarine-launched missile like our Poseidon, or by
                        adding large numbers of hardened but undefended SS–9s or SS–11s. They have
                        the technical capability to deploy any of these systems with highly accurate
                            <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (or single warheads) by the

                    <p>In short, the Soviets have it within their technical and economic capacity to
                        offset any further “Damage Limiting” measures we might undertake, provided
                        they are determined to maintain their deterrent against us. It is the
                        virtual certainty that the Soviets will act to maintain their deterrent
                        against us. It is the virtual certainty that the Soviets will act to
                        maintain their deterrent which casts such grave doubts on the advisability
                        of our deploying the Nike-X system for the protection of our cities against
                        the kind of heavy, sophisticated missile attack they could launch in the
                        1970s. In all probability, all we would accomplish would be to increase
                        greatly both their defense expenditures and ours without any gain in real
                        security to either side.</p>

                    <p>As I noted at the beginning of this memorandum, a limited, i.e., light,
                        deployment of the Nike-X (estimated investment cost, about $3.5 billion)
                        might offer a high degree of protection for our cities against the kind of
                        ballistic missile attack the Chinese Communists may be able to launch in the
                        1970s; and, with some special additions (estimated investment cost, about
                        $660 million), ensure the survival of a significant portion of our Minuteman
                        force even against a heavy, <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed Soviet
                        attack. Such a deployment would have an inherent capability to provide a
                        very high level of protection against accidental and “nuclear blackmail”
                        attacks. And, as a by-product, it would-also have some capability to reduce
                        U.S. fatalities from a Soviet attack against our cities in the early 1970s,
                        provided the Soviets do not immediately react to our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist nuclear weapons and ballistic missile development
                        programs are apparently being pursued with high priority. On the basis of
                        recent evidence, it appears possible that they may conduct either a space or
                        a long-range ballistic missile launching before the end of 1967. Such an
                        event might suggest that the Chinese are aiming at an initial operating
                        capability (<gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>) for an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> as early as 1969, and that the threat to
                        the United States is more imminent than is actually the case. In our
                        judgment, it still appears unlikely that the Chinese could achieve an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> before the early 1970s and deploy a
                        significant number of operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        before the mid-1970s, or that those <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        would have great reliability, speed of response, or substantial protection
                        against attack.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, it would seem prudent to initiate the deployment of a “light”
                        Nike-X system (described in the preceding section) at this time. The
                        effectiveness of this system in reducing U.S. fatalities from a Chinese
                        Communist attack in the 1970s is shown in the table below:</p>

                    <p>This “light” defense could probably preclude damage in the 1970s almost
                        entirely. As the Chinese force grows to the level it might achieve by
                        1980–85, additions and improvements might be required, but relatively modest
                        additional outlays could probably limit the Chinese damage potential to low
                        levels well beyond 1985.</p>

                    <p>In contrast to our sea-based Polaris/Poseidon forces, our land-based
                        Minuteman forces (even though they are installed in hard underground silos)
                        could become vulnerable to a Soviet surprise attack, if the Soviets continue
                        to increase the size and, more important, greatly improve the accuracy of
                        their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> forces. However, even assuming
                        the strongest Soviet threat projected in the latest National Intelligence
                        Estimates for mid-1974, and even assuming that the Soviets use all of their
                        accurate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s against our Minuteman
                        forces, about 470 missiles would still survive. The “light” Nike deployment
                        could increase the number of surviving missiles to 730. Together with the
                        sea-based missile <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0531"/>forces, we would
                        have more than enough for “Assured Destruction”, even if the Soviets deploy
                        an extensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system of the sort
                        described in the latest National Intelligence Estimates.</p>
                    <p>But the most severe threat we must consider in planning our “Assured
                        Destruction” forces is an extensive, effective Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment combined with a deployment of a
                        substantial hard-target kill capability in the form of highly accurate
                        SS–11s or <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>ed SS–9s. By equipping their
                        SS–9 boosters with six <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (each with a
                            <gloss target="#t_CEP1">CEP</gloss> of 0.25 n.mi. and a yield of 3
                            <gloss target="#t_MT1">MT</gloss>), the Soviets could destroy large
                        numbers of our Minuteman missiles. An extensive, effective Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system could then intercept and destroy a
                        large part of our residual missile warheads. (These Soviet offensive and
                        defensive threats are both higher than those projected in the latest
                        National Intelligence Estimates.)</p>
                    <p>We could not count on more than two years of warning between the first
                        intelligence indications of a Soviet <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>
                        development effort and the start of deployment of the system. Assuming that
                        the Soviets start such a development immediately and press forward with
                        their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment at a rate of 1000
                        interceptors per year (beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968),
                        they might achieve the build-up shown below:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>With regard to our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies, two
                        questions arise: (1) What would be their reaction to our deployment of an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system?; and (2) Would they want to
                        deploy such a system?</p>
                    <p>Some European governments and many European specialists in defense and arms
                        control matters have exhibited a growing interest in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense. At the insistence of several European countries,
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense was discussed at the recent
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arms control experts conference.
                        The European and Canadian attitude as expressed at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting was generally hostile to a U.S.
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. The same attitude was
                        expressed by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> delegation at the
                        recent U.S.-<gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> bilateral talks on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s. This reaction appears to be based on a
                        desire to avoid an accelerated arms race which Europeans believe would upset
                        the detente. There is also some fear on the part of the British that an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race would price them out of the
                        nuclear business.</p>
                    <p>Even if the U.S. offered the Europeans a similar system, it is unlikely that
                        they would accept; only Germany has expressed a mild interest thus far. This
                        is so for several reasons. First, the cost (at least $6 billion, and
                        probably more, for a meaningful system) would involve a substantial increase
                        in their defense budgets. Second, the European preoccupation with deterrence
                        rather than defense makes it unlikely that they would pay for such an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Third, the Europeans are unlikely
                        to achieve the degree of political and decision-making unity which would be
                        necessary to deploy an effective <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most difficult problem we will have to face in a decision not to
                        deploy at this time an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system for
                        defense of our cities <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"/>against a
                        Soviet ballistic missile attack is the attitude of our Congress and our
                        people. The first reaction of most Americans to the events I have described
                        at the beginning of this memorandum will inevitably be in favor of an
                        immediate start on production and deployment, if for no other reason than
                        the Soviets are deploying such a system. More mature reflection on all of
                        the factors involved in this vastly complex problem should convince at least
                        the majority of the informed public that any attempt on our part to build an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense which could keep our
                        fatalities in a Soviet “second strike” below what the Soviets consider would
                        deter a U.S. attack, would almost certainly force them to respond by
                        increasing their offensive forces and would therefore be self-defeating. But
                        a massive program will have to be undertaken to present all of the relevant
                        information, and in an understandable form, to both the Congress and the
                        general public. Without such an understanding, we cannot hope to gain their
                        support for a sensible <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> program.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In view of the great uncertainties surrounding both the Soviet and Chinese
                        Communist missile threats over the next five to ten years, and the
                        advantages that even a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense
                        might offer in dealing with possible accidental and “nuclear blackmail”
                        attacks, a “light” deployment of the Nike-X may be worth its cost. But none
                        of the four purposes for which deployment of Nike-X might make sense would
                        justify a crash program at this time. Even without an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense, and even if the
                        higher-than-expected Soviet threat develops, our surviving offensive missile
                        and bomber forces could inflict at least [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                            of source text not declassified</hi>] on the Soviet Union in 1974.
                        Moreover, we do not know when, if ever, the higher-than-expected Soviet
                        threat will develop. Nor do we believe that the Chinese Communists could
                        have a significant number of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s before
                        the mid-1970s. (The possibilities of accidental or “nuclear blackmail”
                        attacks probably would not, in themselves, justify even a “light” deployment
                        of the Nike-X.) Finally, much work remains to be done in the development,

                    <p>Mr. President:</p>

                            “Production and Deployment of the Nike-X,”<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">

                            alternative proposal for Nike-X deployment recommended therein. They do
                            not consider that detailed comments on the draft memorandum are
                            required; however, they suggest that the draft memorandum should be
                            amended to set forth more adequately a rationale supporting the
                            recommended deployment.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_DEPEX1">DEPEX</gloss> II deployment of Nike-X that the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff have recommended to you is designed to counter an evolving <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> threat to the United States. They consider that the
                            proposed Nike-X deployment alternative will not be able to cope with all
                            aspects of the evolving threat. They agree, however, that this modified
                            deployment will provide some measure of area and city defense, provide
                            partial protection of Minuteman sites, guard against the consequences of
                            accidental launch of nuclear missiles toward the United States, and
                            discourage the use of “nuclear blackmail.”</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The inclusion of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems in any arms control
                            negotiations with the Soviet Union raises complex political, military
                            and psychological problems, many of which stem from the developing
                            communist Chinese nuclear capability. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider
                            that the military aspects of such negotiations should be carefully
                            weighed prior to and during negotiations; they are prepared to provide
                            appropriate advice as needed. In any event, deployment of Nike-X should
                            not be delayed pending initiation or conclusion of arms control
                            negotiations since, apart from the military requirement, implementation
                            of the proposed deployment of Nike-X would provide the United States
                            useful negotiating leverage.</item>

                                    date, many of our efforts to halt the arms race have not borne
                                    fruit. We shall continue these efforts, but meanwhile, we must
                                    also continue to maintain the strength and flexibility essential

                                    inferior to our Nike-X anti-ballistic missile development. The
                                    Soviet Union has always invested heavily in defensive systems,
                                    and their initiation of anti-ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) deployment is consistent with
                                    past practice. However, we have concluded that they are

                                <item>One point that should be recognized concerning changes in
                                    offensive capabilities is that the Soviet Union is introducing
                                    quantitative changes whereas the US is now pursuing qualitative
                                    changes. As a result, the Soviet Union can be expected to narrow
                                    the numerical gap in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s that
                                    has for some time existed in our favor. However, more is

                                    significance of strategic forces. Although we could, if there

                                    qualitative superiority will continue to yield a number of

                                    However, broadly speaking, they can be thought of as

                                <item>A key point is that Soviet defenses would have to intercept a

                                    uncertainties as the changes the Soviets might make in their own
                                    capabilities in response to such a deployment. Under some
                                    assumptions, US defenses would be relatively ineffective. Under
                                    other assumptions, US defenses might limit damage and reduce
                                    casualties.</item>

                                    also be designed to protect our strategic offensive forces. (The

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) As reflected in reference 1c,
                            present continuity planning by the Joint Chiefs of Staff provides the
                            necessary flexibility to adapt to whatever relocation action the
                            President may select in an emergency. However, there is no assurance
                            that such relocation action will be initiated in sufficient time nor, if
                            initiated in time, that it would ensure survival of the present <gloss target="#t_NCA1">NCA</gloss>. Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff

                                        the following three groups of alternate <gloss target="#t_NCA1">NCA</gloss> should be designated:</p>

                                    desired. For example, the Deputy Secretary of Defense has not

                            operations. The persons designated by law as successors to the <gloss target="#t_NCA1">NCA</gloss> should be briefed on the plan and made

                    </list>
                    <p>The Administration is now considering a proposal to initiate in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–68 the deployment of a “light” <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense of the United States. While there
                        are many pros and cons to this complex question, I believe that on balance
                        such a system is not only unnecessary at this time but, in fact, contrary to
                        our net strategic interests.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this “light” <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would
                        be primarily to provide a high level of protection against any Chinese
                        missile capability that would emerge in the 70s and to increase the
                        survivability of our Minuteman force against a massive Soviet counterforce
                        attack. It is not claimed that the system would be able to defend U.S.
                        cities against a heavy, sophisticated Soviet missile attack.</p>
                    <p>My objection to the deployment of the proposed <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system is not based on any difference with the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>’s evaluation of the system’s technical
                        capabilities. Although one cannot rule out the possibility of catastrophic
                        failure of such a complex system, I know of no specific reason to question
                        the conclusions that the proposed system is probably capable of providing
                        effective defense against early Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s and of increasing the survivability of our Minuteman
                        force. The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has accurately stated the
                        limitations of such a system against a massive sophisticated Soviet attack.
                        While I believe that the weight of evidence indicates that the Soviets are
                        not undertaking a massive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment but
                        only a rather pedestrian effort around Moscow, I consider the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>’s somewhat more cautious appraisal entirely
                        reasonable in the circumstances. In any event, I am in full agreement with
                        the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>’s conclusion that the appropriate
                        U.S. response to a Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment is
                        an improvement of our penetration capabilities and not an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.</p>
                    <p>Accepting then the stated limited objectives of the proposed system, I
                        believe that it is by no means demonstrated that it is in fact necessary to
                        initiate deployment of such a system in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>–68.</p>

                        <item>—<hi rend="italic">Protection against China</hi>. I am not convinced
                            that there is a real military case for deploying a system at this time
                            against a future Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> threat.
                            While a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment would
                            have an <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> of less than four years and
                            could be fully deployed in six years, it is unlikely that the Chinese
                            will have even a token <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability
                            before the mid–70s. If the Chinese seek to achieve an earlier direct
                            nuclear threat to the United States, it will probably come in the form
                            of short–range submarine–launched ballistic or aerodynamic missiles.
                            Against this threat, the proposed “light” <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment would be relatively ineffective since
                            short–range ballistic or aerodynamic missiles could be directed against
                            undefended targets on the coast or fly under the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. More fundamentally, it is by no means clear
                            that there is a military requirement for such a system even when the
                            Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force comes into being.
                            Our massive strategic forces provide us with a very high confidence
                            capability to conduct a pre–emptive strike against a small force of soft
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s with relatively slow reaction
                            times. Therefore, as a “blackmail” weapon against the U.S., such a
                            Chinese force would appear to have little value and would in fact be an
                            open invitation to a catastrophic disarming attack by this country
                            against China. As a deterrent, such a Chinese force would also appear to
                            have little value since the Chinese could not hope to use it without
                            assuring the total destruction of China. We have pursued our policies in
                            the past in the face of a tremendously larger Soviet deterrent force,
                            and there does not appear to be any clear reason why we would not
                            continue to do so in the future in the face of a very small early
                            Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> capability.</item>

                                believe there is no question that such a system would improve the
                                survivability of Minuteman, it is by no means clear that there is
                                any requirement to accomplish this on the proposed time scale. We
                                are making a major investment in Poseidon and the upgrading of
                                Minuteman to assure our penetration capabilities against the worst
                                plausible Soviet missile and <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                                threats through the mid–70s. The Soviet threat will in all
                                likelihood not evolve this rapidly; and, even if it does, there will
                                still be adequate time in the future to deploy defenses for our
                                strategic forces. In this connection, it is by no means clear that
                                the proposed system is in fact the most cost effective way to defend
                                hard sites such as Minuteman. This question should be examined in
                                detail as part of the broader study that is now under way to
                                determine appropriate follow–on systems to Poseidon and Minuteman to
                                maintain our strategic posture in the period after the mid–70s.</p>
                            <p>If the above were the only considerations, it might still be argued
                                that the expenditure of $6 billion over the next five or six years
                                would be a relatively small price to pay for the added insurance
                                that such a system might give in the event that we have seriously

                                consequences that will be to our net disadvantage.</p>

                            explain the limited objectives of our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, the decision would very probably lead to a
                            substantial escalation in Soviet strategic offensive and defensive
                            armaments, which in turn would almost certainly escalate the level of

                            that the future of the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            deployment will in part depend on the Soviet reaction to our own
                            strategic decisions.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">
                                <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> Whatever the true

                            deployment, I believe that a decision on our part to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would assure that they will
                            undertake an extensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.
                            Moreover, this decision will put pressure on the Soviets to increase the
                            level of their missile forces beyond whatever their present plans may be
                            and to upgrade the penetration capability of their existing missile
                            forces. This would in turn put pressure on us to increase our strategic
                            forces and upgrade the capability of our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. Even if such an arms race does not actually
                            increase the immediate danger of war, it would certainly increase the
                            tensions between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                            Although it is difficult to evaluate the impact of this development on
                            internal Soviet affairs, the increasing demands of a major build–up in
                            Soviet military expenditures will put increasing pressure on the present
                            civilian Soviet leadership with the danger that there will be a trend
                            back to Stalinist attitudes.</item>
                        <item>—<hi rend="italic">Western Europe</hi>. The decision could have a very
                            divisive effect on our relations with Western Europe. Despite our
                            efforts to explain the limited purpose of our “light” deployment, it
                            would probably prove very difficult to explain to Western Europeans why
                            a similar deployment could not be helpful in protecting them from Soviet
                            “blackmail,” particularly since such a system might be technically quite
                            effective against existing Soviet IRBMs targeted on Western Europe. If
                            the Europeans should press us to assist them in developing their own
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, there would appear to be real
                            political problems in denying them this defense; and, despite any plans
                            to the contrary, we would probably end up paying most of the bill. A
                            more likely consequence, however, would be that the decision would feed
                            the forces of neutralism in Western Europe to the detriment of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> since it would be argued that Europe
                            is now a defenseless pawn in an arms race in which they could not

                                actually be a very poor solution from the point of view of domestic
                                politics in that it will satisfy no one. On the liberal wing, the
                                decision will be widely attacked as an unnecessary and dangerous
                                expense further undercutting the prospects of the Great Society. On
                                the conservative wing, the decision will be attacked as inadequate
                                and as a devious device to avoid coming to grips with the real
                                problem of providing real protection for the U.S. population against
                                a Soviet attack. The majority of people, who are not really
                                particularly interested in this problem anyway, will be presented
                                with a spectacle of a major Administration decision which is
                                attacked on all sides.</p>
                            <p>The effect of this decision on the plans for the Great Society may in
                                fact be much greater than is now apparent. Although the estimated
                                cost of $6 billion for the “light” defense (even if it in fact
                                increases by a factor of two, as could easily be the case on the
                                basis of past experience) would appear to be easily absorbed over
                                the next six years, I believe that this is simply the first
                                installment on a much larger system. I believe that the system at
                                the proposed level is politically unviable and that it would be very
                                difficult to prevent it from expanding over the next few years into
                                the complete Nike–X defense system that the military really wants.
                                It will be extremely difficult to explain to some parts of the
                                country why they are not defended while other parts of the country
                                are. Despite protestations as to the inherent limitations of such a
                                system, there will be a major military–industrial lobby to explain
                                the potential defense capabilities of an expanded system. It is
                                estimated that the cost of such a system would be on the order of
                                $20 billion, which again could easily increase by a factor of two.
                                To this would have to be added the cost of a nationwide shelter
                                program, an improved air defense program to balance the capabilities
                                of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, and eventually
                                radically improved strategic forces to compensate for the almost
                                inevitable increases in Soviet strategic forces to compensate for

                    <p>The President thanked those who had come from out of town for attending, and
                        asked Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to pose the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated, in accordance
                        with a draft paper which had been distributed,<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">Not found.</note> that we faced essentially this choice with respect to
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>—do nothing;</item>
                        <item>—set up a limited so–called “thin” system with a capability: to
                            protect against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> missiles;
                            accidentally launched missiles; nuclear blackmail; and to furnish
                            additional protection for our Minuteman;</item>
                        <item>—install a system capable of protecting our population against heavy
                            sophisticated Soviet attack.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>He stated that he would now solicit the views of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the Science Advisors to the President, and others.</p>
                    <p>He turned to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName>, who spoke
                        for the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> proposed, as the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had in the Austin meeting with the
                            President,<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">See <ref target="#d150">Documents
                                150</ref> and <ref target="#d151">151</ref>.</note> that we install
                        a Nike–X system on a scale capable of protecting 25 major population
                        centers. This would provide a damage–limiting capability; introduce
                        uncertainties about Soviet capabilities which would make them more cautious
                        at a time of crisis; stabilize the nuclear balance; demonstrate that the
                        U.S. was not first–strike minded; and deny the Soviet Union a first–strike
                        capability.</p>
                    <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0553"/>
                    <p>The proposed Nike–X deployment could not cope with all attacks upon us, but
                        it would provide substantial population protection. It would also provide
                        the four benefits cited for the limited “thin” system.</p>
                    <p>In short, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reaffirmed its previous
                        position of support for Nike–X deployment to protect 25 population
                        centers.</p>
                    <p>The views of the Science Advisors were then solicited by seniority, beginning
                        with Dr. <persName>Killian</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Killian</persName> stated that he had addressed himself to this
                        important matter, putting political considerations aside, although he was
                        aware that they were extremely important. He was not persuaded about the
                        need for the minimum first–step in the form of a limited system. Beyond the
                        first step an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would be “extremely
                        dangerous.” If politics required the first step, the thin system of Secy.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was the most sensible.
                        He hoped it would not be necessary. He recognized that it might, however, be
                        an advantage to have committed ourselves to the first step in negotiating
                        with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Kistiakowsky</persName> stated the issue was of very great
                        importance. He agreed completely with the arguments of those who were
                        against massive deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. The
                        argument was complex, but in essence it was this: our system of deterrence
                        is designed now to prevent a nuclear war. The mounting of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system constitutes preparation for nuclear
                        war. It would lead to a radical acceleration of the arms race, in which “all
                        hope would be lost” for arms control agreements.</p>
                    <p>He felt the same arguments applied to a limited “first step.” The
                        international effects would be the same; but they would be stretched out
                        over time. The pressure for expansion of the system would be great and
                        irresistible.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, he did not believe it would even be effective against <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> nuclear blackmail. They would prove
                        ingenious and could turn, for example, to submarine–launched delivery
                        systems, or to a dirty bomb exploded, say, 50 miles off shore.</p>
                    <p>He also doubted that the thin system was the optimum for protecting Minuteman
                        against Soviet attack.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, he recommended against deployment while we undertook a major
                        diplomatic effort to persuade the Soviet Union to stand down. Conceivably,
                        we might put into the budget certain long lead time items for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system to increase our bargaining
                        leverage.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Wiesner</persName> stated that he supported the arguments
                        presented by his two predecessors. An <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system cannot buy defense against Soviet attack. He stated that U.S. and
                        Soviet decisions to deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s would lead
                        to greater casualties in a nuclear war, not less. There is a built–in
                        tendency to overbuild in compensation for the erection of a defensive
                        system. The history of Soviet anti–aircraft in relation to the <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0554"/>expansion of our own Strategic Air Command
                        illustrates this tendency. It is inherent in an offensive–defensive
                        race.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Communist China, there is no need for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. We can rely on normal deterrence.
                            [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>The Chinese already have missile–carrying submarines, and our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s would provide no protection against
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Dr. <persName>Wiesner</persName> said that the introduction of an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> race would lead to great uncertainty
                        and destabilize the arms race. We shall certainly overbuild in response to
                        the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s. He noted that he had spent
                        a great deal of his mature life working on defensive systems: first,
                        anti–aircraft, than <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s. He is now
                        convinced that in the game of nuclear deterrence, defense doesn’t work. The
                        offense will always overcome. He noted the irony of his present position in
                        opposition to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> since, at an earlier
                        time, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had strongly opposed him when
                        he was supporting an air defense system. (General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> noted that it was a different
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.)</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HDF1">Hornig</persName> concurred with what had
                        been said by his predecessors. He noted the issue had been reviewed by three
                        Science Advisory panels. He concluded that it was not feasible to have an
                        effective defense against missiles. The facts were that the Soviet Union had
                        taken steps to deploy a limited system around Moscow. It was a poor system
                        and penetrable. His own people believe the second system now being deployed
                        in the Soviet Union is not <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> but air
                        defense. Against this background and the problems of escalation inherent in
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, he believed it unwise to
                        take the major step recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As for a thin system, he believed that the balance vis–a–vis the Chinese was
                        such that we did not require an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        for that purpose; although a thin system could help against an accidentally
                        launched missile; against an Nth country with nuclear capability stirring up
                        trouble; and it could provide some additional protection to our
                        Minuteman.</p>
                    <p>If it were believed that it would help in our negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>–missile freeze, he would tend to support a limited system.
                        He would, however, proceed slower than the thin system proposed by Secy.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> until we had a
                        definitive response from the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName>Gruenther</persName> stated that he subscribed to the limited
                        thin system outlined by Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. He would support this light deployment for the
                        four purposes sketched by the Secretary.</p>
                    <p>He wished to underline the disagreement in the intelligence community about
                        the functions of the Tallinn system; all hands did not agree that it was
                        strictly anti–aircraft. He said that we should not put <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0555"/>excessive hopes in diplomatic negotiations
                        on this question. In saying that, he wanted it understood that he believed
                        in arms control as the right solution to the security problem in a nuclear
                        age; he was a member of Mr. <persName>John McCloy</persName>’s advisory
                        committee to <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>. He was, simply, not
                        optimistic about negotiating prospects.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>York</persName>, former Director of Research and Engineering in
                        the Department of Defense, stated his agreement with the science advisors.
                        He supported a policy of: “Let’s do nothing now.” He said the case against
                        full–scale deployment of Nike–X had been understated. The workings of the
                        system could lead to an increase in casualties in a nuclear war. The most
                        that might be said is that casualties might be cut.</p>
                    <p>What is certain, he said, is that the arms race would accelerate, and the net
                        result would be, in the future, as in the past, that more American lives
                        would be at risk each year. If the installation of our defensive system were
                        the last move in the arms race, then, of course, less lives would be at
                        risk. But that would not be the last move, and in the end, more U.S. lives
                        would be in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>As for the Soviet system, in his judgment, it is so ineffective that we can
                        afford to defer a decision. He repeated: we should do nothing at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>We have a very vigorous <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> effort going
                        forward. It creates a better potential <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system each year. We should maintain that vigorous effort.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to summarize. He said our choices are: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Do nothing.</item>

                            <item>The thin system with its four limited functions. It was estimated
                                to cost $4.2 billion. We must count on the actual cost being 25 to
                                50% higher than that. It would cost $250 million a year to
                                operate.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Installing Nike–X to protect the population in substantial numbers
                                in 25 cities. This system is now estimated to cost $13 billion to
                                build. We must expand that realistically to $20 billion. In fact,
                                his estimate is that it would cost $40 billion in 10 years.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The argument against deployment was that the Soviet Union must build a system
                        which will [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] and have enough striking power left to inflict such
                        casualties on the U.S. that we would not strike the Soviet Union in the
                        first place. An <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system is not capable of
                        reducing U.S. casualties to the point where the Soviet Union would not be
                        able to carry out its policy in this matter.</p>
                    <p>The counter–argument is that we could try and protect our population to some
                        degree. His view is that the effort to protect would lead to an offensive
                        increase in the Soviet Union which would more than offset our initial effort
                        to protect our population.</p>
                    <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0556"/>
                    <p>As for the limited thin system, it might play some role in pushing the Soviet
                        Union into negotiations, but we could not guarantee that. It offered some
                        protection against a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> attack. He
                        said that he would be more concerned than he now is, with our policy of
                        bombing North Vietnam, if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s had
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s. A thin system could protect us
                        against the kind of missile accident that, statistically, might happen with
                        the passage of time and the multiplication of missiles. He referred to the
                        Mace incident of January 4.<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">Reference is to an
                            unarmed Mace missile launched from Eglin Base, Florida, on January 4,
                            which strayed over the western tip of Cuba and landed in the Caribbean
                            Sea after its destruction system failed and a U.S. jet fighter was
                            unable to shoot it down.</note> It might also provide some protection
                        against nuclear blackmail.</p>
                    <p>He felt the decision about a limited thin system was “marginal.”</p>
                    <p>As for the case for doing nothing, the President had heard the pros and
                        cons.</p>
                    <p>The President asked Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        for his recommendation. He said he would prefer to withhold judgment now and
                        present his view to the President later.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President then summarized: the Chiefs wish to go all the way; the
                        scientists say No; but if we go we should go with a thin system because it
                        might help our negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was his
                        judgment that it would help; that the argument has some merit. There has
                        been some evidence in the past 3–4 weeks. But the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem is extremely difficult: once you start you are
                        pregnant. It will be virtually impossible to stop.</p>
                    <p>The President then asked for a summary of intelligence on the Soviet
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, asking Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> to correct him if he disagreed,
                        stated that the assessment of Nov. 17, 1966, based on July information,
                        showed disagreement in the intelligence community.<note n="6" xml:id="d166fn6">See <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> The
                        majority agreed that a limited <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        was being deployed around Moscow which was penetrable by heavy U.S. attack
                        or through Polaris missiles. In addition, a wide–scale system was being
                        deployed which might contain as many as 240 missiles by 1971. There was some
                        evidence that this so–called Tallinn system was solely designed against
                        aircraft; but others believed it was an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system, or dual purpose. In December we acquired new evidence that it is
                        more probably anti–aircraft, since some units are not linked to the radar
                        which is required to track missiles.<note n="7" xml:id="d166fn7">Not further

                    <p>Secy. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concluded by stating
                        that, in his view, it made no difference. No defensive system could be
                        effective. He recalled that when he became Secretary of Defense he first
                        investigated the ability of <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> to penetrate
                        the Soviet Union. To his surprise he found that the best estimates indicated
                        that [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                        The Soviet Union has spent 2–1/2 times as much as the U.S. on defense and
                        has not gotten any serious protection for those expenditures. The Soviets
                        have an irrational bias towards defensive systems. Their present deployments
                        around Moscow are not militarily justifiable, but represent an instinctive,
                        almost theological desire to protect Moscow as the center of Russian
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The President again thanked those present. He stated he would take their
                        views into account. He was particularly grateful for those outside the
                        government who again showed their willingness to serve. When he came to make
                        his decision he would do so with greater confidence because they had come.
                        He had talked with others about this matter, including General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.<note n="8" xml:id="d166fn8">In

                    <p>In the evening of January 4, 1967, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> telephoned the President. After a brief discussion
                        of details on strategic stockpile sales in the defense budget, the two
                        talked extensively about the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem.
                        When the President asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        what he thought of the meeting with the Joint Chiefs and the former science
                        advisers (see <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>), <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Well, the only reason I didn’t give a recommendation when you asked

                                still favor doing nothing as we initially recommended three or four

                                nothing. The forces pushing you to do something are very, very
                                strong indeed. But I myself agree fully with Killian and the science
                                advisers. I don’t think we’ll buy anything worth going ahead. But if
                                we’re to go ahead, then I think the best thing to do is the ‘thin’

                        <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also mentioned that the
                        President could ask for the views of the contractors who would profit from
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment. He said that he met with
                        these high–level business executives about 2 weeks earlier, and “without
                        qualifications” they were all opposed to an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system against the Soviet Union. When the President asked
                        who these businessmen were, he gave their names. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued that these contractors
                        were willing to support fully the “thin” system, however, and had worked out
                        its technical capabilities, time schedule, amount of money required, and the
                        protection it would provide against China and for the U.S. offensive
                        systems.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> seemed to be saying that the full
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system was “not worth the price,”
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied, “To be
                        absolutely honest with you, Mr. President, I don’t.” He believed, however,
                        that Congress would “absolutely crucify him and through me you” if he
                        testified against it, as he was prepared to do. But, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> continued, “I feel it’s
                        wrong.”</p>
                    <p>The two discussed the difficulty in advocating a “thin” system, which would
                        be a first step, and according to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> the Joint Chiefs would go along with a “thin”
                        system on these terms. But the administration might be pushed, as <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> put it, toward a heavy system
                        costing $20 or $40 billion “that won’t buy a damn thing.” They also
                        discussed proposing the “thin” system as a “contingency” and going to a full
                        system if an agreement limiting <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s could
                        not be negotiated with the Soviet Union, but <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not think much of this strategy.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then asked, what if
                        the administration started on a “thin” system and then got an agreement with
                        the Soviet Union? “Oh, oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, yes, there’s a real
                        possibility of that, Mr. President,” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded. He went on to summarize the <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> talks on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        systems, and noted that he believed that the Soviets were willing to talk on
                        the issue. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had very recently
                        given <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> “a fair amount of
                        information,” from which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        theorized that the Soviets’ <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system was
                        to protect Moscow “only as a symbol of all Russia, and that this Tallinn
                        system probably is not an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.” Their
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system might be extended “to
                        Leningrad, Kiev, and a few other major centers,” but the Soviets did not
                        intend it to be “a very widespread deployment.” Thus “it might be fairly
                        simple to negotiate a limitation with them if we were willing to limit to
                        something like Moscow. So I think there is a real possibility here of
                        fruitful discussions.”</p>
                    <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0559"/>
                    <p>At the end of their conversation, the President remarked, “So what it adds up
                        to is you’re against contingencies and really if you were in my position,
                        you’d do nothing.” “I guess, Mr. President,” <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied, “what I mean to say is that I’d go down
                        fighting, and I’m damn sure I’d go down. [He laughs.] A lot easier for me to
                        say.” The President interjected, “Do you think that’s wiser for us to do?”
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded, “Well, I
                        don’t know, I don’t know;” and he added that if the decision was to do
                        nothing, the administration would have to wage “a tremendous publicity
                        campaign” with editors, scientists, and opinion leaders to win public
                        support.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> then turned to the
                        budget. He said that Senator <persName>Russell</persName> wanted to see him
                        before he closed it. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> urged
                        him to see Russell before the opening of the next session of Congress.
                        Russell, he warned, “is just going to tear us apart this year. He will
                        probably want to tell you that we ought to go all the way on nuclear power
                        for service ships and increase the bombing of North Vietnam and just a lot
                        of other things. We ought to push ahead on a manned bomber and push ahead on
                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> and push ahead on new air defense
                        and so on.”</p>
                    <p>When the President asked whether the Joint Chiefs of Staff were “reconciled”
                        to the budget, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded
                        affirmatively, adding that “there’s no great emotional feeling that they
                        ought to have more.” The Chiefs had had “a good hearing” and the decisions
                        “were not bad.” But the problem was that these were “emotional issues,” and
                        when the Chiefs testified before Congress, they would be told, “surely,
                        you’re a man and not a mouse,” and they would like to add these programs to
                        the defense budget. Put in these terms, the Chiefs would say “yes.” (Johnson

                        include legal successors to the Presidency in each Group. The concept
                        envisions three Alternate <gloss target="#t_NCA1">NCA</gloss> Groups

                        upon direction of the President under conditions of crises escalation. The
                        purpose of the displacement is to insure that, in the event of general war,

                        survive to carry on the affairs of the nation. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have suggested the following composition of the Alternate

                    <p>As you may recall, we studied the problem of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> command and control support to the President in some depth
                        in 1964,<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">The conclusions of this study are
                            printed as <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> and, in doing
                        so, we examined possible courses of action the President might take in
                        respect to Alternate Decision Groups during intense crises or general
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Although our study pointed out there might be some advantages to
                        pre–designation and pre–location of Alternate Decision Groups that included
                        legal successors to the Presidency, the nature of the problem would
                        undoubtedly prevent such an arrangement. That is, many of those in the line
                        of succession are the ones that the President will need most to assist him
                        in coping with the situation. Further, those of the legal successors most
                        suited to assume the Presidential role of the Commander–in–Chief are the
                        very men the President will want most with him, and those of the legal
                        successors most available for relocation are the men who would be least
                        qualified to face the immediate responsibilities to which they
                            succeeded.<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">In the margin next to this

                    <p>Our study stated that “ … the major decisions relating to utilization of an
                        Alternate Decision Group that does not include the President will be made by
                        the President at the time of crisis. The decisions will name the leader of
                        the group, determine its composition, and select a time or condition for
                        relocation. These are problems that are particularly sensitive to the
                        desires of a particular President, to the relationships he has established
                        with his Cabinet and with other personal advisors, and to the estimate of
                        the situation he develops at the time the groups might be employed.”</p>
                    <p>In our opinion this is a sound and realistic appraisal of the problem of
                        pre–designation of Alternate Decision Groups that include Presidential
                        successors, since the selection of an Alternate Decision Group is
                        essentially a political matter resting solely with the President and based
                        on conditions existing at the time. Accordingly, we recommend that you not
                        approach the President on this matter.</p>

                                it could be of some assistance. The stated purpose would be to

                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>In the continued absence of a large–scale Soviet program of deception
                            and concealment we believe that we would almost certainly detect any
                            extensive new deployment in strategic forces, although the Soviets could
                            probably effect small–scale increases without our knowledge. The timing
                            of detection and identification would vary with the nature and size of
                            the program. We probably would identify a land–mobile offensive system,
                            for example, but perhaps only after it had become operational in
                            substantial numbers.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>We would almost certainly detect any large–scale test program, but we
                            could not always expect to assess accurately the test objectives or even
                            the precise nature of the system being tested. Our capabilities are
                            generally better in the case of offensive than of defensive weapons. We
                            believe, for example, that we could detect and identify Soviet testing
                            of multiple, independently–targeted reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s); we could probably also detect test
                            activity associated with an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system,
                            but are not confident that we could identify it as such before it became
                            operational.</item>

                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Our capabilities for detecting qualitative improvements in the
                            deployed forces are better in the case of defensive weapons than
                            offensive ones. Our chances of determining whether a <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system had been provided with
                            significant <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capabilities are at
                            present about even, but we think that they will improve. On the other
                            hand, we see no prospect of determining whether <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s (if developed) or other significant improvements had
                            been incorporated in deployed offensive missiles.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>Soviet employment of deception and concealment on a large–scale would,
                            of course, degrade our capabilities. The principal effect would be that
                            of delay. Thus, while we still believe that substantial new deployment
                            would almost certainly be detected, detection would come later in the
                            program, perhaps not until after significant deployment had occurred.
                            Some of the deception and concealment measures which the Soviets could
                            employ would probably be recognizable as such, but their purpose might
                            not be readily apparent. Additionally, we assume that the Soviets will
                            not interfere actively with US collection systems.</item>

                            that the Soviets have not violated one or more provisions of the

                            involve the use and possibly the compromise of very costly and highly
                            sophisticated intelligence collection methods.</item>

                        <item>The basic problems for intelligence, as it relates to verification of
                            a weapons limitation agreement, are to collect information to interpret
                            it correctly, and to satisfy US decision–makers of the validity of those
                            interpretations in time for them to take appropriate action. No single
                            source of information can be exclusively relied upon for these purposes,
                            although the unique capabilities of overhead photography and signal
                            intelligence will inevitably make them essential sources. Regardless of
                            sources, however, intelligence cannot be expected to guarantee that the
                            Soviets have not violated one or more provisions of the agreement under
                            consideration. In general, our confidence in detecting and identifying
                            violations will increase in proportion to the extent of deployment or
                            testing involved.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We have generally been successful in identifying new programs during
                            the test phase and, except for defensive systems, test data has <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0565"/>been an important source of
                            information on characteristics. It should be remembered, however, that
                            new strategic weapon systems will have been under development for
                            several years before they are detected in the test phase. Our collection
                            capabilities are lower with respect to production; we have identified
                            many plants involved in weapons production, but have acquired little
                            evidence on production rates. In regard to deployment, however, we have
                            a high degree of confidence in our estimates of current order–of–battle
                            for Soviet strategic forces; the physical magnitude of most of these
                            programs and of their supporting elements has made them readily
                            identifiable.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Over the period of this estimate, we believe that our capabilities to
                            collect detailed information about Soviet strategic programs will
                            increase, but at the same time, qualitative improvements in some Soviet
                            weapon systems will probably be difficult to detect and evaluate. During
                            the period of this estimate, we believe that the Soviets could probably
                            effect minor increases in various elements of their strategic forces
                            without our knowledge, but that any large–scale net deployment in any of
                            these elements almost certainly would be detected—in some cases early in
                            the program, in others not until later.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>In the following discussion, we will attempt to quantify the degree of
                            confidence which we have in our ability to detect further deployment or
                            improvements to certain specific Soviet strategic weapon systems under
                            most normal circumstances. We reserve to a later section our
                            consideration of Soviet capabilities to evade detection through
                            deception, concealment, or interference.</item>

                        seriously concerned about the broader implications of the problem, and this
                        is not simply a disguised criticism of the Administration’s policy in

                        warfare, with the exception of riot gases and herbicides. Although this
                        would not directly respond to all the points in the petition or transmittal
                        letter, it would deal directly with the most important general question. As
                        you recall, I suggested such a statement in a memo to you (copy
                            attached)<note n="5" xml:id="d170fn5">

                        objections unless there were a clear and urgent reason for doing so. If you
                        are interested, I believe it would be possible to clear such a statement
                        within the government, particularly if the statement were a low–key
                        reiteration and clarification of the position we have already taken in

                        <item>In <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–8–66, we estimated that as
                            of 1 October 1966 the Soviet missile submarine force had some 45
                            ballistic missile submarines (8–10 nuclear–powered) with a total of
                            about 130 launchers, and an equal number of cruise missile units (21–23
                            nuclear–powered) with about 250 launchers.</item>

                        <item>A recent review of Soviet submarine order–of–battle indicates that as
                            of 1 October 1966 there were 36 ballistic missile submarines in the
                            Soviet Navy (7 of them nuclear–powered) with a total of about 100
                            launchers. The cruise missile submarine force—whose primary mission is
                            to counter naval task forces—was found to have a slightly greater number
                            of units than previously estimated, and a greater proportion of
                            nuclear–powered units. Since the latter are equipped with more missile
                            launchers than the diesel–powered boats, approximately 265 launchers
                            (rather than 250) were found to be in the cruise missile submarine
                            force.</item>

                        <item>We continue to believe that a new type of ballistic missile submarine
                            will enter service by mid–1968. Since fewer ballistic missile submarines
                            are now operational than previously estimated, however, our projection
                            of the number of such units which will be operational in 1976 has been
                            reduced from some 60–70 to about 55–65. There is no change in our
                            estimate of the total number of cruise missile submarines for 1976
                            (i.e., 55–65 units) but we believe the proportion of nuclear submarines
                            in the cruise missile force will be somewhat higher at that time (i.e.,
                            about 45 out of 60, rather than 40 or so out of 60).</item>

                        verbal expressions to describe our estimated capability to detect land

                        translation into number.</p>
                    <p>First with regard to Land Mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s,
                        IRBM’s, and <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>’s:</p>
                    <p>We can quote no discrete odds for detection in the early stages of
                        deployment. Our word “possible” in this context simply means that we are not
                        certain of being able to detect nor do we feel it is impossible that we will
                        detect. Your mathematical friends define this use of “possible” as “non–zero
                        probability.”</p>
                    <p>As to extensive deployment of these weapons systems we feel our chances of
                        detecting are greater than even and less than overwhelming—say in the
                        general bracket 65% to 85% Second, with regard to Missile–launching
                        Submarines:</p>
                    <p>As to detecting units of an entirely new class before <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>, we have put the odds in the 65% to 85% bracket.</p>
                    <p>As to detecting new units of an existing class before delivery to the fleet,
                        we put the odds about even; 50–50.</p>

                        within its authority and competence to offer. To undertake further necessary

                        and the guidance of other elements of the United States Government, the
                        Trustees of The Asia Foundation on March 21, 1967, publicly declared that
                            <gloss target="#t_TAF1">TAF</gloss> is a private organization; that its
                        Trustees have accepted funds from <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                        intermediaries in the past and, by inference, can no longer do so; and that
                        they fully intend to continue programming in Asia with support from both
                        private and overt official sources. It is imperative that this declaration
                        be supported by normal or near–normal <gloss target="#t_TAF1">TAF</gloss>
                        operations in Asia over the months ahead. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of

                        other prospective private donors; but, as a practical matter, no immediate

                        Trustees and appropriate agencies of the U.S. Government can endeavor to
                        arrange adequate permanent sources of support from private and official
                        sources for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969 and beyond. If by
                        December 31, 1967, it becomes apparent that adequate support is not
                        forthcoming, the Agency recommends that serious consideration be given to
                        phasing down or terminating the Foundation.</p>

                    <p>In early Spring 1967, the White House Office of Emergency Planning (<gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss>) completed a revised edition of its study,
                        “Resource Mobilization Plan for Limited War.” Regarding the planning and
                        drafting of this study in 1966, see <ref target="#d138">Document 138</ref>.
                        The 31–page revised study, dated April 1967, covered the means whereby the
                        U.S. Government could effectively mobilize the central management of
                        resources in emergency circumstances short of a nuclear attack. It included
                        the basic measures, policy and legal documents, and the organization
                        structure required in the event of an emergency requiring the mobilization
                        of the nation’s resources during a limited war. Emergency action documents
                        providing the basic authorities required for the mobilization of the
                        nation’s economic resources were included in a classified Annex A of the
                        plan. Annex B comprised resource sections developed by the federal agencies.
                        A copy of the entire plan was distributed to the Department of Defense under

                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. “The proposed

                    <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                    <p>There is mounting evidence that a significant slowdown occurred in the rate
                        of silo construction starts in the Soviet SS–11 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment program after mid–1966. Although new
                        construction is continuing, it appears likely that the rate of construction
                        starts for this relatively light payload <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> has been cut back by more than 50 percent from the high
                        rate attained in the first half of 1966. Curtailment of the rate of
                        construction starts appears to have affected at least half of the ten SS–11
                        complexes—specifically, the earliest five complexes, where some 300 SS–11
                        silos have already been started or completed—and suggests that the entire
                        program is tapering off even though it may continue for some time. It is
                        believed that there are currently more than 500 SS–11 silos in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, of which about 150 have been completed
                        and are now operational. Virtually all of those now under construction are
                        likely to become operational by mid–1968.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, new silo construction for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s other current <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        system, the heavy–payload SS–9, has continued into 1967 at a steady pace and
                        there are clear indications that further construction starts are planned.
                        There are an estimated 180 SS–9 silos in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, including about 70 already operational; most of those
                        that are now under construction will be operational by mid–1968.</p>
                    <p>The curtailment of the SS–11 program may indicate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is approaching its force goal for this
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system which, because of its
                        limited accuracy and relatively small payload, is suitable primarily for
                        attacking cities and other soft targets. However, the leveling off of the
                        rate of silo starts for this system does not necessarily indicate that the
                            <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0581"/>
                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is approaching a programmed limit in
                        deployment of ground–launched <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> systems.
                        Coinciding with the change in the SS–11 program, construction activity at
                        new missile launch areas at the Tyuratam Test Range indicates that one and
                        possibly two new systems are under development. As yet, there is no evidence
                        to indicate whether the next round of deployment will replace or supplement
                        the existing <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, but the new
                        systems may foreshadow the end of additional construction for one or both of
                        the current deployment programs in the near term, perhaps during 1967.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of current evidence, the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force will attain a level of some 900 operational
                        launchers by mid–1968 and 1,000 or more by mid–1969, if there is no
                        phase–out of earlier generation systems. While this number could be
                        increased still further by the introduction of new systems, any substantial
                        increment effected by these newer systems would be expected to occur in the
                        1970–75 period.</p>

                        <item>Ambassador Kohler agreed that the State Department would nominate a

                            Foundation through its difficult realignment period and set it on its

                            would be a single solution. He also indicated that, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] a proper
                            husbanding of resources should leave the Foundation with sufficient

                            <p>In the past year, there has been no major change in the broad Soviet
                                military policy, which continues to place primary emphasis on
                                strategic weapons. Outlays for defense have accelerated with the
                                continuation of large–scale deployment of strategic missiles, both
                                offensive and defensive, and continued research and development
                                    (<gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss>) on new strategic weapon
                                systems. The Soviets are building forces which we believe will give
                                them, in the next year or two, greatly increased confidence that
                                they have a retaliatory capability sufficient to assure the
                                destruction of a significant portion of US industrial resources and
                                population. They will probably also seek, through both strategic
                                attack and defense programs, to improve their ability to reduce the
                                damage the US can inflict on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should deterrence fail and war in fact occur. We
                                believe that the Soviets would not consider it feasible to achieve
                                by the mid–1970’s strategic capabilities which would permit them to
                                launch a first strike against the US without receiving unacceptable
                                damage in return.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">
                                    <p>Major Gen. <persName>Jack E. Thomas</persName>, the Assistant
                                        Chief of Staff, Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, would substitute for the last sentence of
                                        Conclusion A the following:</p>
                                    <p>“The Soviets may not consider it feasible to achieve by the
                                        mid–1970’s strategic capabilities which would permit them to
                                        launch a first strike attack against the US without
                                        receiving unacceptable damage in return. On the other hand,
                                        the sustained intensity with which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is pursuing its massive
                                        military <gloss target="#t_RD1">R&amp;D</gloss> efforts and
                                        the pace of its strategic systems deployment suggest the
                                        Soviets could be seeking, over the long term, a combination
                                        of capabilities which could yield a credible first strike
                                        capability against the US. Even if the Soviets considered
                                        that this still would not make rational deliberate
                                        initiation of nuclear attack against the US, they might well
                                        believe that achievement of a credible first strike
                                        capability would be worth the cost in view of the strong
                                        backup this would provide for aggressive pursuit of
                                        objectives in other areas of world.” [Footnote in the source

                        <item>The most important issues of military policy at present center upon
                            the strategic relationship with the US. Certain major deployment
                            programs are either slowing or nearing completion. The Soviet leaders
                            are probably now considering further development and deployment of
                            strategic systems for the 1970’s. For the present, we rate the chances
                            as less than even that they would agree to any extensive program of arms
                            control or disarmament.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets almost certainly believe that their strategic position
                            relative to that of the US has improved markedly. In the next year or so
                                <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0586"/>they will approach
                            numerical parity in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers,
                            which we believe to be their present goal. They are aware, however, of
                            planned improvements in US strategic offensive missile forces which in
                            their view would threaten to erode their strategic position. Possible
                            Soviet responses could take the form of a considerable increase in the
                            numbers of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers, development
                            of mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, a greater emphasis on
                            ballistic missile submarines, or qualitative improvements such as the
                            development of very accurate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s,
                            possibly equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s).</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets have probably concluded that if no arms control agreement
                            is reached a US decision to deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s
                            will soon be forthcoming, and are probably concerned lest a US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment seriously degrade their
                            retaliatory capabilities. A US decision to deploy either heavy or light
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses would probably lead the
                            Soviets to develop and deploy penetration aids and possibly <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s for their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, or they might increase the size of that force.
                            Systems designed to elude US <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            defenses, such as aerodynamic vehicles or space weapons, might be given
                            greater emphasis. Whatever their specific responses to developments on
                            the US side, we believe that the Soviets will hold it essential to
                            maintain what they would consider to be an assured destruction
                            capability.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>We continue to believe that the Soviets will deploy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s in defense of areas other than Moscow,
                            but their decision may await the availability of an improved system. In
                            any case, given the lead–times involved, <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses will probably not become operational outside
                            the Moscow area before the early 1970’s. We would expect to detect
                            construction of such additional defenses two to three years before they
                            became operational.<note n="6" xml:id="d183fn6">Lt. Gen.

                                capability for the Tallinn system. They believe that the information
                                available at present is still insufficient to estimate with
                                confidence the full capabilities and mission of the Tallinn system.
                                They agree that the available evidence does support a conclusion
                                that the Tallinn sites have a defensive mission against the
                                aerodynamic threat except against low altitude threats. However,
                                they also believe that the system, where augmented by the Hen House
                                type radar, has a capability against ballistic missiles over a
                                substantial portion of the deployment area; and that the system has
                                considerable growth potential. They therefore would evaluate its
                                continuing development and deployment with this capability in mind.

                        <item>Developments in the general purpose forces indicate a greater concern
                            with meeting contingencies short of general war and a recognition of the
                            possibility of postponing, limiting, or avoiding the use of nuclear
                            weapons. In part this represents a reaction to the US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0587"/>strategy of flexible response,
                            but it also represents a more general interest in broadening the range
                            of Soviet military capabilities. Sealift and airlift have been
                            considerably expanded. We do not believe, however, that the Soviets are
                            developing the sea and air combat capabilities required for distant
                            limited military action against opposition. They evidently see
                            advantages in wars fought by proxy with indigenous forces rather than by
                            their own forces, a practice which reduces both military risks and
                            adverse political reactions. In extending their influence abroad they
                            will continue to give economic and military aid on a large–scale, and to
                            use political and diplomatic means.</item>

                        <item>The Soviets now describe China as a power with a policy “clearly
                            hostile” to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They have
                            increased their military strength in areas close to the Chinese and
                            Mongolian borders, and are moving to strengthen the defenses of
                            Mongolia. At present they appear to regard the Chinese as posing more of
                            a border security problem than a major military threat, but they almost
                            certainly see the potential threat of China as increasing over the
                            longer term. So long as the Sino–Soviet conflict persists, Soviet
                            military planners will have to take account of the possibility of
                            large–scale war with China and China’s emerging strategic nuclear

                        <item>The internal situation appears generally favorable to the continuation
                            of a strong military effort. The present leaders seem more responsive
                            than was Khrushchev to the opinions of the military hierarchy. Estimated
                            military and space expenditures for 1967 represent an increase of 16
                            percent over 1965, a marked change from the more stable level of
                            spending during 1962–1965. The adverse effects on the economy of large
                            military and space programs will exert some restraining influence on
                            military spending. We believe that military expenditures will continue
                            to rise, but at a rate generally consonant with the growth of the Soviet
                            economy.</item>

                            will be continued despite resource allocation problems. The Soviets
                            probably regard such an effort as imperative in order to prevent the US
                            from gaining a technological advantage and also to gain, if possible,
                            some advantage for themselves. But in deciding to deploy any new weapon
                            system they would have to weigh the prospective gain against the
                            economic costs and the capabilities of the US to counter it.</item>

                        <item>Soviet foreign policy will continue to be based primarily upon
                            political and economic factors, but the military capabilities that the
                            Soviets are developing and the military relationships that are evolving
                            will affect their attitudes and approaches to policy. They will probably
                            seek to gain some political or propaganda advantage from their improving
                            military position, and may take a harder line with the US in various
                            crises than they have in the past. We do not believe, however, that
                            their improved military capabilities will lead them to such aggressive
                                <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0588"/>courses of action as would,
                            in their view, provoke direct military confrontation with the US. The
                            Soviet leaders recognize that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            as well as the US is deterred from initiating general war, and will

                            was further recommended that the decision not to deploy Nike–X be

                            such an agreement with the Soviet Union have indicated little promise of

                            his recent discussion with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the
                            assessment that the Soviet Union would not be ready for talks on this

                            that the timing of a Nike–X deployment decision is critical to an
                            effective defense of the United States. Among the actions recommended to

                            no other single action is considered <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0589"/>more necessary than the deployment of Nike–X. Delay of
                            Nike–X deployment provides the Soviet Union with the combined advantages
                            of continuing their own ballistic missile buildup without complicating
                            their attack strategy and, concurrently, continuing their antiballistic
                            missile deployment, which already poses significant problems to the US
                            strategic offensive forces.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Since the United States first
                            proposed negotiations to limit both strategic offensive and defensive
                            forces in 1964, the Soviet Union has shown no evidence of slowing down
                            the deployment of such forces nor have they stated any intent to do so.
                            Indeed, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> representatives have
                            indicated no interest in this subject at the Eighteen Nation Disarmament
                            Conference and intelligence information indicates that the Soviets have
                            accelerated their deployment of such forces. At the same time, the
                            communist Chinese are advancing toward a strategic capability at a
                            faster rate than had been anticipated as evidenced by their recent
                            detonation of an air–dropped thermonuclear device. The apparent progress
                            they are making toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile
                            with an initial operational capability as early as 1970 adds to the
                            urgency of initiating a Nike–X deployment.</item>

                            and Deployment of Nike–X (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>),”<note n="4" xml:id="d184fn4">
                                <ref target="#d162">Document 162</ref>.</note> the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff advised against delay in deploying Nike–X, pending initiation or
                            conclusion of arms control negotiations. They stated that, in addition
                            to the military advantages to be gained, initiation of Nike–X deployment
                            would provide the United States useful negotiating leverage. The Soviet
                            Union is now benefiting from a US limitation on ballistic missile
                            defenses, whereas the United States is without compensating benefits.
                            While there is considerable incentive for the Soviets to engage in
                            protracted and indecisive negotiations, there is no apparent advantage
                            now for their agreeing to a limitation on ballistic missile defense. A
                            Nike–X deployment decision would either stimulate Soviet participation
                            in meaningful negotiations or disclose their lack of serious interest in
                            this matter. In view of recent events, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName>’s assessment, and the

                            Starting on page 38 there is an extended passage describing the
                            difference in our approach to the Soviet and the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> capabilities. We should emphasize
                            that we are working at highest priority to develop the technology of an
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system and that deployment has
                            in no way been delayed by decisions we have taken because the system is
                            now in a development stage (in fact, Bob believes that the first
                            production orders related to deployment could only rationally be given
                            in December of this year, given the unresolved development
                            problems).</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>I would add that in backgrounding on this matter tomorrow and in the
                            days ahead, we should try to deflate the notion that we are in a
                            hysterical race between a <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            development of an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system and our
                            development of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. The simple
                            fact is that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s have shown
                            themselves systematically extremely cautious in military operations and
                            extremely respectful of U.S. military power, including our nuclear
                            power. They have talked an aggressive doctrine but behaved cautiously at
                            the time of Quemoy Matsu; the Tibet engagement against India; the
                            India/Pak war; and in Viet Nam. They obviously have some nuclear devices
                            now which could be dropped from aircraft. They have not proceeded to do
                            so. There is every reason to believe on the record that they will be
                            deterred by our overwhelming retaliatory power. This does not mean that
                            we shall not deploy, necessarily, a thin <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system against them. It does mean that there is no
                            reason for panic.</item>

                            background on this issue, as follows: The Central Intelligence Agency

                            N.W., Washington, D.C., which the National Student Association (<gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>) leased from the Independence

                            conduit. The leaders of the <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, which

                            at the cost only of maintenance and repair,” had refused to give up the

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> indicated that he had been
                        visited by Joseph Rauh, Jr., an attorney representing the <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> on behalf of the UAW. Rauh’s tentative
                        proposal was that the title and mortgage be handed over (approximate cost
                        $64,360). On its part, the Agency felt the unspent accrued funds be
                        allocated to the <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, thus constituting a
                        write–off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> indicated,
                        however, that in view of general student leader intransigeance on
                        negotiations, this was a propitious solution. The principals went along with
                        this as an efficacious egress from an awkward situation.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Mr. President:</p>
                    <p>I believe you will wish to read at least the summary at the beginning of this
                            estimate.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">The attached <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> 11–4–67 is printed as <ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The situation it describes is not alarming; but I suspect it will be
                        exploited as a political issue in 1968.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are increasing the number of their hardened <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>’s while we are increasing the number of
                        our warheads.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it will be argued, they are “closing our nuclear superiority
                        gap.”</p>
                    <p>The argument will be buttressed by evidence, from the statistical war games
                        that are played each year, that: <list>
                            <item>—the number of Soviet targets is increasing faster than our
                                megatonnage on targets;</item>
                            <item>—a nuclear exchange would result in increasing U.S. fatalities and
                                industrial damage, decreasing Soviet fatalities and Soviet
                                damage;</item>
                            <item>—we now have to take the Chinese Communist threat more
                                seriously.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Again, no one thinks we are moving to a position where a Soviet first strike
                        is likely to become rational in the foreseeable future. But the numbers will
                        be moving unfavorably over the coming year; and you may wish to begin to

                    <p>1. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) This Volume of the Joint Strategic
                        Objectives Plan develops the military strategy for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970–<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1977.
                        It emphasizes those elements of the strategic concept which influence major
                        issues that should be addressed in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1970 Department of Defense budget. It also considers the implications of the
                        current conflict in Southeast Asia relative to the strategic concept for the
                        mid-range period.</p>

                        of the elements of national power, military force is justified on the basis
                        of its contribution to the support of national policy. US national security
                        policy is not contained in any single, nationally-approved document. It is
                        constantly and dynamically evolving through informal and formal processes.
                        It emerges from this process that US national security interests will be
                        served best by fostering a peaceful international community which is not
                        inimical to the US Government and is based upon consent of the governed,
                        dignity of the individual, and respect for the rule of law. Attainment of
                        this world of peace with justice through peaceful means is a US national
                        goal in the most fundamental sense. Nevertheless, throughout the mid-range
                        period the presence and exercise of US military power will continue to be
                        essential to protect the interests of the United States and its allies,
                        while conditions favorable to peaceful attainment of this goal are being
                        pursued.</p>

                        objectives as the leading world power. The development of a world community

                    <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The increasing economic gap between the
                        developed and developing areas of the world is a principal factor
                        contributing to international tensions. Progress is hindered by deficiencies
                        in their technological and educational base, primitive production means,
                        inefficient <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0596"/>land distribution,
                        overpopulation, archaic customs, religious, racial, or caste rigidity, the
                        inability or unwillingness of governments to cope with these conditions, and
                        in some cases, a lack of resources. The progressive withdrawal of colonial
                        powers will create power vacuums. These developing areas will be
                        characterized by social and political turbulence, which the communist states
                        will try to aggravate and exploit. Both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Chinese Peoples Republic (<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>), each desirous of improving its relative position in the
                        world power structure, have reoriented their strategies; i.e., the Soviets’
                        espousal both of peaceful coexistence and of “wars of national liberation,”
                        and the Chinese communists’ doctrine of “peoples war.” Whether the problems
                        will be settled through armed conflict or through peaceful means will depend
                        primarily on whether the Free World will retain a willingness and capability
                        to execute successfully effective political, economic, psychological, and
                        military programs for the prevention or defeat of subversion and
                        insurgency.</p>
                    <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Sino-Soviet rift is likely to
                        persist and may widen. As it continues, the rift lessens the likelihood of a
                        coordinated military threat to the United States. At the same time,
                        competition between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist
                        China for leadership in the communist movement probably will increase. These
                        individual activities probably will conflict with interests of the United
                        States. Accordingly, the planning that precedes major decisions should,
                        where appropriate, include consideration of what effect these decisions
                        might have on <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> relations.</p>
                    <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) A significant element in the world
                        environment is the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons. Canada,
                        India, Israel, and Sweden have the capability to develop nuclear weapons.
                        The Federal Republic of Germany (<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>) and
                        Japan could also attain such a capability. The emergence of new nuclear
                        powers during the period of this appraisal, while not necessarily leading
                        toward nuclear conflict, would produce more pressures for arms control, and
                        nuclear guarantees or sharing, and would complicate the risk assessment in
                        crises. The greatest continuing threats to the United States and its allies
                        will be posed by the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                    <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) Another factor is a trend toward
                        weakening of alliances. As western-oriented nations grow stronger
                        economically, and the threat of war appears to diminish, their common
                        interests will recede, their national interests will attain new prominence,
                        and they will be less willing to meet common military needs. On the other
                        hand, the resurgence of nationalism in East European nations and the
                        pressures to broaden relations between Eastern and Western Europe will
                        militate against the success of Soviet efforts to maintain the current level
                        of military, economic, and political integration of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0597"/>
                    <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Space competence is important to
                        national security just as it is to national technological progress and
                        prestige. The Soviets have the capability to orbit a nuclear-armed satellite
                        and frequently have alluded to “orbital rockets.” Recent Soviet feasibility
                        tests could lead to orbital bombardment systems. The United Nations
                        resolution against offensive weapons in orbit and the celestial bodies/outer
                        space treaty are steps in the direction of agreements defining rules for
                        space use. There would be political liabilities for any nation which
                        repudiated or violated their provisions. Nevertheless, hostile offensive
                        orbital systems, even in limited numbers, would seriously augment the
                        principal threat of ballistic missile attack against the United States.
                        Accordingly, the US strategic posture should provide capabilities for
                        surveillance of and active defense against potential orbital threats, as
                        protection against possible covert or precipitous overt violation of
                        agreements and against possible threats by nations not parties to
                        agreements.</p>
                    <p>10. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) The maritime capabilities of most of
                        the major nations are essential elements of their economic and strategic
                        power. This factor alone will account for a continued interest in the oceans
                        and in the traditional principle of freedom of the seas. The strategic
                        importance of the ocean areas will continue to increase as science and
                        technology provide better ways of exploiting their military and economic
                        value. The exploitation of the oceans for food and marketable products will
                        assume increasing importance, as will rights to oil and minerals from the
                        ocean bed. Increasing international interest in the ocean gives rise to
                        problems of territorial sovereignty over the contiguous sea areas extending
                        in many cases beyond traditional limits of territorial waters. Conflicting
                        concepts of the extent of territorial waters, with particular regard to
                        territorial seas that do or may comprise international straits, will be a
                        continuing source of serious international friction. US interests require
                        that the principle of freedom of the seas, in the sense of free passage, be
                        preserved. Increasing pressures for extended rights to commercial
                        exploitation should be recognized in US strategy. The United States should
                        seek legal solutions to those pressures, but should recognize that it may
                        have to enforce such solutions once they are reached.</p>
                    <p>11. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The aviation potential of most of the
                        major nations is a significant element of their national power. In addition
                        to the important capabilities provided by military aircraft, civil air
                        carriers complement merchant shipping and show the flag throughout the
                        world. The use of air transportation to provide US assistance to some of the
                        less developed nations provides an incentive for those nations to develop
                        aircraft support facilities which may be of use to the United States in
                        future contingencies.</p>
                    <p>12. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) US forces could be hampered or delayed
                        in responding to certain contingencies by lack of overflight rights and
                        adequate bases. In <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0598"/>anticipation of
                        this problem, the United States should seek to obtain and maintain
                        overflight and foreign base rights in strategic areas throughout the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>13. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Additional limited arms control
                        measures, such as nonproliferation treaties, additional nuclear test bans,
                        nuclear free zones, agreements on peaceful use of outer space, and mutual
                        force reductions may be negotiated during the mid-range period. The
                        achievement of general and complete disarmament is highly unlikely, although
                        the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, as the two
                        leading nuclear powers, will continue to consider such measures. There is
                        ample evidence to indicate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        and other communist states will not agree to a complete verification system
                        such as required by the United States.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Balance of Military Power</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>14. (S) The most dangerous threat to the United States is posed by the
                        rapidly growing strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet Union. This threat is
                        so serious in its potential consequences, regardless of the estimated
                        intentions of the Soviet Union, that it must receive primary cognizance in
                        the formulation of military strategy and in the development of force levels.
                        Although Soviet strategic offensive forces can inflict enormous damage upon
                        the United States in a first strike, they cannot, at the present time,
                        destroy enough of the US nuclear offensive and defensive forces to preclude
                        retaliatory destruction of Soviet Union urban-industrial resources. However,
                        the Soviets are continuing to build forces, which it is believed will
                        increase their confidence in a retaliatory capability sufficient to assure
                        the destruction of a significant portion of US industrial resources and
                        population. They are also active in efforts, through both strategic
                        offensive and defensive programs, to improve their ability to reduce the
                        damage the United States can inflict on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should deterrence fail and strategic nuclear war occur. In
                        addition, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has the capability to
                        conduct a massive nuclear attack against Eurasia. In the absence of
                        continued US improvements in strategic capabilities, Soviet offensive and
                        defensive systems could attain in the course of their development
                        significant counterforce and defensive damage-limiting capability against
                        the United States. It is necessary, therefore, for the United States to make
                        timely improvements in its strategic offensive and defensive capabilities,
                        to preserve a credible deterrent to convince the Soviets that they cannot
                        achieve a viable first strike option.</p>
                    <p>15. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Irrespective of the unlikelihood of
                        deliberate Soviet initiation of a strategic nuclear attack, the possibility
                        of strategic nuclear war through escalation or miscalculation cannot be
                        dismissed. Further, the United States cannot safely discount the possibility
                        that Soviet leaders might launch a preemptive strike if they considered
                        themselves inextricably <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0599"/>involved in
                        a major confrontation over critical objectives. Finally, they might launch a
                        preemptive strike if they believed nuclear attack upon the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> were imminent.</p>
                    <p>16. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> strategic nuclear capabilities are expected to remain
                        superior to those of all other nations for the period of this appraisal.
                        However, by 1970, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> probably will have
                        sufficient missiles and warheads to attempt nuclear blackmail in the Western
                        Pacific-Asian area. In the early 1970s, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> is expected to be able to pose a limited nuclear threat to
                        the United States and to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>17. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Strategic power relationships could be
                        upset by: unmatched technological advances in weapon systems, particularly
                        in strategic nuclear systems; violations of major arms control agreements;
                        unbalanced arms reductions; and major shifts in alliances and alignments.
                        For example, if the Soviets were to achieve warheads having significantly
                        improved nuclear effects for their ballistic missile defense systems, prior
                        to compensating accomplishments by the United States, the military power
                        relationship would be upset, perhaps critically, in favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. For these and other reasons, a vigorous
                        US nuclear test program is necessary within the restrictions of the present
                        Limited Test Ban Treaty.</p>
                    <p>18. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Warsaw Pact and the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> have significant general purpose forces
                        which pose major threats to Western Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and a
                        limited threat outside these areas. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will gradually modernize its general purpose forces to
                        improve their capabilities to engage in sustained nonnuclear as well as
                        nuclear warfare. The emphasis probably will be on improving active combat
                        support and service support units. It is believed that the resulting
                        augmentation will be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the number
                        of divisions, so that toward the end of the mid-range period there will be a
                        reduced number of larger divisions with better support, with no significant
                        change in the total number of men in the ground forces. Soviet capabilities
                        for airborne and amphibious assault remain tied to support of Eurasian
                        operations. These contiguous capabilities are being expanded markedly as the
                        capacity and efficiency of air and sealift forces are increased. The
                        expansion of the Soviet merchant fleet and the development of very large
                        transport aircraft will also improve Soviet capabilities to move unopposed
                        military forces to distant areas. However, developments thus far do not
                        signify any urgent Soviet program to acquire capabilities for opposed
                        distant operations.</p>
                    <p>19. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The increasing maritime strength and
                        capability of the Soviet Union derive from three elements of seapower: a
                        combatant navy, a merchant marine, and a fleet of oceanographic, survey, and
                        fishing vessels. The Soviet merchant marine and oceanographic fleet can be
                        classed with those of the leading nations of the world. The Soviet navy, <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0600"/>although not a balanced force by
                        Western standards, is quantitatively the second largest in the world, and is
                        undergoing qualitative improvement in both the strategic and general purpose
                        categories. As Soviet maritime capabilities continue to grow, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will increase its capability to meet its
                        own shipping requirements and to expand its political influence throughout
                        the world through economic and military assistance.</p>
                    <p>20. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Evidence indicates that the Soviets
                        have stockages to support substantial chemical warfare operations and that
                        training of personnel in their use has been extensive. Research to improve
                        toxic nerve agents and efforts to develop nonlethal incapacitating agents
                        are continuing. The Soviets have a variety of chemical munitions and
                        delivery vehicles for dissemination of chemical agents and a wide range of
                        defensive chemical warfare equipment.</p>
                    <p>21. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The likelihood of conflicts involving
                        US interests during the mid-range period, as well as their form and outcome,
                        will depend upon the degree to which the United States and its allies
                        maintain a military capability that provides a credible deterrence and
                        effective flexible response throughout the spectrum of potential conflicts.
                        However, even if the US posture is improved to counter the growing and
                        increasingly complex threat, deterrence will not be infallible, and
                        conflicts will occur. Some judgments on the likelihood of conflict are
                        possible in the context of such continuing US posture improvements.</p>

                    <p>22. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) This Part expands the global appraisal
                        in Part II into more specific appraisals for each of the major regions of US
                        security interest. These regional appraisals, and the preceding world
                        appraisal, provide the background for the strategic concept which follows in
                        Part IV. Together, the appraisals and concept serve as a basis for
                        subsequent presentation in Part V of force planning guidance for over-all
                        objective force level analysis and derivation in succeeding Volumes and
                        Annexes <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0601"/>of <gloss target="#t_JSOP1">JSOP</gloss> 70–77. The sequential treatment of regions and areas does
                        not imply a fractionalization of the threat or a priority among mutually
                        exclusive area concepts, since the threats to all areas are in some respects
                        identical and in most respects overlapping. The regional and area concepts
                        and the US global concept for strategic nuclear offensive and defensive
                        operations are interrelated.</p>

                        Europe, with its industrial, economic, technological, and military strength
                        and potential, is second only to the United States in strategic importance
                        as a Free World power center. Loss of this area to communism would be
                        intolerable. The principal strategic significance of the Mediterranean and
                        North African areas results from their geographical location with respect to
                        the southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Europe. The
                        Mediterranean is one of the primary trade routes for Western Europe and,
                        with its airspace, is the principal avenue for deployment of US forces into
                        the southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and into the
                        Middle East and North Africa. The United States continues to maintain bases
                        in some countries bordering the Mediterranean for the support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, communications, training, storage of
                        pre-positioned war reserve stocks and weapons, custody of part of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear stockpile, and potential staging
                        facilities.</p>
                    <p>24. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The US objectives for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Mediterranean area, including
                        North Africa, seek to insure the security of those areas against communist
                        aggression and influence and to further their economic growth and political
                        stability. The United States should support North Atlantic Alliance efforts
                        to keep the peace and maintain the independence of its members in a way
                        which would provide a basis for detente, further Atlantic ties, foster
                        European unity, and promote arms control. In addition, the United States
                        encourages a prominent role for the other members of the Alliance in
                        worldwide peacekeeping.</p>
                    <p>25. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The pressures of national sovereignty
                        and regional rivalries will continue to be major obstacles to the
                        achievement of a more closely integrated European defense community than
                        that now represented by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. However,
                        during the mid-range period, the United States should pursue the goal of an
                        economically, militarily, and politically integrated Western Europe as the
                        principal way in which Western Europe can realize its full potential. The
                        United States believes that Europe should be “outward-looking” and accept
                        its share of world responsibilities. The United States supports the movement
                        of other eligible European nations such as the United Kingdom toward
                        full-fledged membership in the European Economic Community (EEC). Admission
                        of the United Kingdom to the EEC could stimulate the creation of new
                        European defense arrangements. These developments <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0602"/>could provide the added military capability
                        required to cope with most nonnuclear contingencies which will threaten
                        Europe, and contribute to worldwide peacekeeping, while the United States
                        provides the preponderance of the nuclear deterrent, and the additive forces
                        to cope with major aggression.</p>
                    <p>26. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The uncertain character of French
                        cooperation in the event of war in Europe, and the denial of the use of
                        French territory and facilities in peacetime, adversely affect the readiness
                        and capabilities of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to respond to
                        Warsaw Pact aggressions. Current efforts by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and French military authorities to identify a workable
                        formula for wartime cooperation between the two forces indicate that, though
                        French forces have been withdrawn from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, France is still willing to consider under what conditions it
                        would resist various Warsaw Pact aggressions in concert with its allies. The
                        denial of French territory and airspace divides <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> territory and military defense into two principal regions
                        making mutual support far more difficult than in the past. The weakening of
                        the center emphasizes the importance of the problems of the flanks. Unless
                        overflight of France is granted, the support and reinforcement of the
                        southern flank will be provided principally by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces in the Mediterranean area and deployments from the
                            <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>. Support or reinforcement of the
                        northern flank without further weakening the center will necessitate
                        increased reliance on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>’s Atlantic naval
                        forces and deployments from the <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>27. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The United States now relies upon a
                        line of communication (<gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>) through the
                            <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Benelux countries to support forces in
                        Central Europe. This restricted <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> must be
                        shared with other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies and the
                        demands of the civilian populace. It is more vulnerable to attack than was
                        the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> through France. To exploit fully all
                            <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> capabilities within this area, much
                        greater reliance must be placed upon capabilities to protect channel convoys
                        and the use of inland waterways. In addition, highways and railroads must be
                        improved in the region of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-Benelux
                        frontier.</p>
                    <p>28. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations are militarily dependent upon the United States.
                        The US strategic deterrent and general purpose forces are essential to
                        Western European security. Continued US efforts to maintain the credibility
                        of this deterrent to both the Warsaw Pact and US <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies are necessary.</p>
                    <p>29. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Soviet leaders apparently desire to
                        avoid involvement of their own forces in war with the West, but have not
                        renounced as an ultimate goal the extension of Soviet influence throughout
                        the world. Even though the policies and strategy by which the Soviets seek
                        to realize their ends show signs of evolving in response both to political
                        changes in the world and to the continuing existence of a credible Western
                        deterrent, the fundamental issues underlying the tension <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0603"/>between East and West have not been
                        resolved. Soviet policy, which is supported in varying degrees by the
                        Eastern European countries, will continue to be based on economic and

                        have followed a more cautious line in recent years, influenced significantly

                        greatest threat to Libyan stability stems from internal friction between
                        those who support the monarchy, and those who, like Nasser, espouse a
                        radical socialist form of government. The moderate positions of the
                        Tunisian, Moroccan, and Libyan Governments with respect to Israel have
                        evoked the distrust of the radical Arab States. Border disputes between
                        Algeria and Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya could develop into open hostilities,

                        Israel is involved. The Arab nations have the capability to deny their oil

                        and nationalize the oil industry. However, for economic reasons, such
                        actions would probably not be of long duration. Should they provide bases
                        for Soviet military deployments/operations in the Mediterranean, the adverse
                        consequences would include a diminution of US prestige and influence in the

                        lead to a takeover by leftist groups. The United States should monitor the

                        significance stems from its geographic location, the Suez Canal, its vast
                        oil resources, its ports, the potential for use of its important forward
                        staging and base areas, and its potential as a foundation for increased
                        Soviet influence. Most of the forces and factors that have given this region
                        a high potential for conflict in the past will continue into the mid-range
                        period. The June 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict points up the unpredictability
                        of specific alignments in the area and the miscalculations which deep-seated
                        enmities can stimulate; reinforces the improbability of a near-term
                        accommodation between the two sides; and emphasizes the need for an enduring
                            <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0605"/>solution. Other divisive
                        intraregional quarrels will persist, such as the Yemen dispute and the

                        circumstances, due to <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proximity and

                        experience political and social turmoil during the next decade. The greatest
                        threat to peace stems from the instability occasioned by changes in
                        leadership and the coupling of the modernization process with racial and
                        tribal tensions. This instability and receding Western influence leave an
                        environment susceptible to communist exploitation. Communist influence
                        probably will increase if Western Europe continues to reduce its levels of
                        assistance. Sub-Saharan Africa is of significance largely because of its
                        potential were it to fall within the sphere of communist influence. In
                        addition, base, transit, and overflight rights, and other such requirements
                        are significant in the event operations develop which involve US
                        participation. Both sea and air base facilities assume greater significance
                        in use of alternate routes during any closure of the Suez Canal. South
                        Africa presents special problems to the United States. It has the most
                        significant armed forces in Africa south of the Sahara and its facilities

                    <p>40. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) Asia has become the arena for open
                        military conflict arising from three interrelated confrontations: US–<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, and US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. US policy in Asia since 1949 has
                        emphasized containment of the multiple threats posed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> was created for
                        this purpose and has proven to be a useful instrument. A policy emphasizing
                        containment will continue during the mid-range period, dealing with the
                        threats generated by subversion, insurgency, and armed intrusion in Asian
                        mainland areas and in the adjacent Western Pacific. The threat of such
                        aggressions stems directly or indirectly from the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>. US political, economic, psychological, and military
                        measures taken in the peripheral areas should be oriented to an over-all
                        strategy centered on Communist China.</p>
                    <p>41. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The end results of US efforts in
                        Vietnam will influence strongly the future of Asia and will bear critically
                        on the prospects for US influence on the developing nations of the world.
                        Additionally, long-term Asian issues which will impact on the US security
                        interests are: the extent to which India, Japan, and Australia develop their
                        military capabilities and display a willingness to play a positive role in
                        the affairs of Asia; the willingness and ability of the United Kingdom to
                        continue to play a power role in Southeast Asia; the ability of the
                        Philippines to resist a growing threat to its political stability; the
                        ability of Indonesia to achieve stability and become a constructive factor
                        in Southeast Asia/Southwest Pacific affairs; the ability of South Korea to
                        maintain a stable, noncommunist government and deter aggression; and the
                        extent to which the free countries of Asia will seek increased mutual
                        accommodation to create a counterweight to Chinese power.</p>

                        military capabilities will improve over the next decade, with continued
                        emphasis on the attainment of significant nuclear weapons capabilities.
                        Long-term <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> goals include achievement of
                        major power status, dominance in Asia, ideological leadership of
                        international communism, and the expulsion of US power and influence <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0608"/>from Asia. Corollary objectives
                        include: control over territory now held by the Government of the Republic
                        of China (GRC), detachment of Japan from its alliance with the United
                        States, neutralization of India as a competitor for regional power, and the
                        restoration of Chinese suzerainty over Korea and mainland Southeast Asia.
                        The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> is not likely to resort to overt
                        military intervention or aggression so long as it considers the probable
                        losses greater than the likely gain and can anticipate success through other
                        means. Nevertheless, the use of <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> military
                        force must be anticipated if Chinese border areas are threatened, if the
                            <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> leaders wrongly assess US
                        intentions, or if a neighboring communist state, such as North Vietnam, is
                        near collapse or requests Chinese assistance. The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> military capability to attack the Republic of Korea,
                        Southeast Asia, and India is significant. The major weaknesses of <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> armed forces are in sea power, logistic
                        support, and lack of modernization of their substantial air forces, which
                        would limit the scope of their military operations. The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> now has a limited capability for nuclear
                        strikes against peripheral Asian targets which it can be expected to exploit
                        politically. This capability is expected to increase significantly during
                        the mid-range period.</p>
                    <p>43. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also poses a serious threat in the Pacific area because of
                        its ability to provide material assistance to insurgent movements and modern
                        arms to governments susceptible to Soviet influence, and because <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> forces have a capability to strike,
                        harass, or neutralize a large portion of the US military forces in the
                        Pacific-Asian area. Moreover, the expansion of the Soviet merchant marine
                        and the development of very large transport aircraft will improve Soviet
                        capabilities to move unopposed military forces and equipment to distant
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>44. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Japan is by far the strongest nation in
                        Asia in economic terms. At its own pace, it probably will increase its
                        military strength and may slowly and cautiously assume larger security
                        responsibilities in Northeast Asia. The possibility that Japan will
                        eventually assert a position of leadership in Pacific-Asia warrants specific
                        consideration in US planning. As Japan enlarges its role in Asia,
                        preservation of close US-Japanese ties is important to US interests
                        worldwide. US base rights in the Japanese homeland and on Okinawa and
                        available skilled Japanese manpower and industrial support are major
                        elements in support of US military posture throughout the Western Pacific.
                        Pressure for the restoration of the Ryukyus to Japanese sovereignty and
                        control in some form can be expected, but continued US use of the Ryukyuan
                        bases will remain fundamental to US strategic concepts for the area.</p>
                    <p>45. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) South Korea, with its growing economy
                        and industrial base, is an anchor point of US forward strategy in Northeast
                        Asia. The presence of US combat forces on South Korean territory provides
                        evidence <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0609"/>of a firm commitment,
                        adding to the credibility of the US deterrent in Northeast Asia. So long as
                        the United States continues its firm commitment to assist in the defense of
                        South Korea and provides appropriate military and economic assistance, South
                        Korea probably will continue as a cooperative ally in Asia, will be able to
                        provide forces for its own defense, and may contribute forces to other
                        operations in Asia. Overt aggression from the north remains a possibility in
                        the mid-range period but the more immediate danger probably will be the
                        growing incidence of communist infiltration, propaganda, and subversive
                        activity from North Korea. A North Korean intensification of this activity
                        would add to the difficulties of the ROK Government in providing combat
                        forces outside of Korea and would increase pressure on the United States for
                        additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> assistance and a continued US
                        presence in Korea.</p>
                    <p>46. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The GRC has a capability for continued
                        and improved economic viability on Taiwan, but does not have sufficient
                        military power to reestablish itself on the mainland or to defend Taiwan
                        unaided against a large-scale sustained <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>
                        assault. The military importance of the GRC in terms of US security
                        interests stems from US access to bases and facilities on Taiwan, the denial
                        of these facilities to the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, and from the
                        substantial threat GRC armed forces pose to the mainland tying down <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> forces in the coastal provinces. While
                        military limitations and concern over US response will deter the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> from attempting military conquest of
                        Taiwan, the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> may periodically undertake
                        military action in the Taiwan Straits area to test GRC defenses and probe US
                        determination. The present US objective of preventing a <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> military seizure of Taiwan will continue;
                        however, it is also in the US interest to avoid involvement in, and to
                        discourage GRC initiation of, a war with the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> in an attempt to restore its control over the mainland.</p>
                    <p>47. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Philippines provide major US base
                        facilities essential to the forward strategy in the Pacific-Asian area. The
                        Philippine Government is expected to continue its alliance with the United
                        States but will require strong US support. For the mid-range period, the
                        threat of external attack, other than the potential Chinese intermediate
                        range ballistic missile (IRBM) threat, is not great; however, the potential
                        for subversion and insurgency is significant and rising. This threat stems
                        from a variety of dissident minority groups, including the illegal Communist
                        Party and remnants of its military arm—the Huk. In addition, a strong Muslim
                        group, which does not fully support the government, exists in the southern
                        islands, and Indonesian claims to the southern island, though now dormant,
                        can become an issue during the mid-range period. These factors, together
                        with signs of a breakdown in law and order and extensive unemployment, are
                        causing a progressive deterioration of governmental control. Additionally,
                        an element of extremism is emerging that includes considerable anti-US
                        sentiment <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0610"/>and opposition to the
                        Philippine Government for sending forces to Vietnam. These conditions are
                        inimical to the longstanding US interests in the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>48. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The United Kingdom has stated its
                        intention to reduce further its military forces in the Far East during the
                        next few years. It is in the US interest to encourage the United Kingdom to
                        delay its final departure from the Singapore base as long as possible and
                        particularly until the situation in Southeast Asia is resolved. The United
                        States, because of its heavy commitments elsewhere, is not in a position to
                        assume the added responsibility for the security of the Singapore-Malaysia
                        area.</p>
                    <p>49. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Australia and New Zealand have close
                        defense ties with the United States and basically adhere to a forward
                        defense strategy in Asia. As the military presence of the United Kingdom
                        recedes and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> bellicosity continues—both
                        likely eventualities—Australia and New Zealand will rely increasingly on the
                        United States rather than the United Kingdom. Australia is increasing its
                        military potential and, over the long run, could become the only non-Asian
                        nation, other than the United States, with significant power in the
                        Pacific.</p>
                    <p>50. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In Indonesia, in view of the
                        anticommunist violence which accompanied the 1965 change of regime, the
                        present government has a large stake in preventing a return of communist
                        power. Indonesia’s membership in the United Nations has been renewed,
                        Indonesian relations with the West have improved, and there has been a
                        distinct withdrawal from the formerly strong associations with the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, North Vietnam, and North Korea. The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> can be expected to attempt to regain its
                        former influence in Indonesia. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                        will seek to restrict or eliminate Western influence in Indonesia, as well
                        as to thwart any <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> move to regain
                        ascendancy. While continuing to seek military assistance and aid from both
                        the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Indonesia
                        probably will strive to maintain a nonaligned position in its relation with
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the West.</p>
                    <p>51. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Southeast Asia currently presents the
                        most serious and complex problems facing the United States in sustaining its
                        containment policy. The United States has chosen to take a stand in Vietnam
                        against communist use of “peoples war” and “wars of national liberation.”
                        Involved in the outcome of this conflict are such long-term issues as: (a)
                        the confidence of other nations in the US collective security policy and,
                        consequently, their will to resist aggression and insurgency; (b) the future
                        of US influence in the affairs of Asia; (c) the prospect of more or fewer
                        communist-inspired and supported insurgencies throughout the underdeveloped
                        world; (d) leadership of the world communist movement; and (e) the extent of
                        progress by the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> toward its basic goal of
                        dominating Asia and excluding Free World interests and influence. The <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0611"/>US purpose in Vietnam will continue
                        to be to assist the Government of Vietnam in defeating communist subversion
                        and aggression, in winning the allegiance of the people, and in attaining an
                        independent, noncommunist society functioning in a secure environment.</p>
                    <p>52. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In Thailand, deployments of US forces
                        are largely to meet the needs of the Southeast Asia conflict, including
                        operations in Laos. The facilities developed during this conflict could be
                        used to provide a base for future US/<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                        deployments, should this become necessary. Thailand is faced with a growing
                        problem of insurgency primarily in the northeast sector, supported by the
                        Pathet Lao and North Vietnam. The Thais, with aid provided through the US
                        Military Assistance Programs, will probably be able to hold this insurgency
                        in check as long as US/allied effort continues to contain the primary threat
                        in South Vietnam. The United States looks to Thailand to play a role in
                        strengthening regional resistance to aggression and has declared that full
                        support of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty would be
                        provided in the event of direct communist attack. The other nations of the
                        Southeast Asian peninsula—Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and
                        Singapore—will be unable to provide, without outside assistance, for their
                        own defense against either external communist aggression or major internal
                        subversion. The neutral status of Laos and Cambodia has been undermined by
                        their use as sanctuaries by North Vietnam/Viet Cong combat forces.
                        Accordingly, although the United States respects the neutral status of these
                        countries, operations by US forces are required to negate such use by the
                        North Vietnam/Viet Cong forces.</p>

                    <p>53. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The primary threat to North America
                        will be from Soviet strategic nuclear forces. The ballistic missile threat
                        is expected to increase. That threat may be supplemented by weapons
                        deliverable from orbit or with depressed trajectories, if such systems are
                        developed. The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> will represent a growing
                        threat in the 1971–1980 time frame. Since the most likely air or
                        intercontinental ballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>)
                        attack approach is via the polar regions, Canada’s aerospace and
                        participation in <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> continue to be of
                        great significance. Inasmuch as submarine-launched missiles pose a threat
                        off both coasts of North America, it is important that US-Canadian
                        antisubmarine warfare arrangements be continued. It is expected that
                        military relations between Canada and the United States will continue to
                        reflect the fundamental identity of common defense interests, but may be
                        affected by Canada’s growing nationalism and by its increasing sensitivity
                        to any form of US pressure.</p>
                    <p>54. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In most of Latin America, political,
                        sociological, and economic instability, frequently exploited by communist
                        subversion and <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>insurgency, will
                        continue. The principal threat to US interests will continue to be such
                        communist subversion and insurgency. Although now remote, the possibility of
                        insurgencies of serious proportions occurring simultaneously in several
                        Latin American countries, must be taken into account. The communists seek
                        to: (a) erode US influence, exploiting the anti-US character of Latin
                        American ultranationalism; (b) undermine the Organization of American States
                            (<gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>) and the Alliance for Progress; (c)
                        neutralize Latin American armed forces; and (d) subvert legitimate reform
                        and nationalist movements. Cuba will continue to be the main base in Latin
                        America for communist subversion as long as the Castro regime retains
                        control but, in the near-term, Cuban-instigated movements are not expected
                        to reach sufficient proportions to overthrow Latin American governments.
                        However, other sources of violence and discontent may well overthrow weak
                        governments because of lack of public support or military
                        disenchantment.</p>
                    <p>55. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) A prime communist objective will be to
                        weaken the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> and prevent the establishment
                        of regional peacekeeping forces which could thwart a communist takeover of
                        any nation in the area. It is not likely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Communist China, or Cuba would participate in direct
                        military operations and risk a confrontation with the United States.
                        However, communist countries can be expected to provide material, economic,
                        psychological, and political support of communist-inspired activities in
                        Latin America, together with training of local communist leaders.</p>
                    <p>56. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Most Latin American governments and
                        their armed forces will probably remain pro-United States and anticommunist,
                        although nationalist tendencies will become more pronounced. If the military
                        leaders cannot obtain what they believe to be sufficient US military
                        equipment, their US-orientation will diminish and they will continue to seek
                        and obtain military assistance from other sources.</p>
                    <p>57. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Close cooperation in countering
                        communist insurgents can be expected between certain countries; e.g.,
                        Guatemala and Honduras, Bolivia and Argentina, and Colombia and Venezuela.
                        Nevertheless, most Latin American security forces would be unable to cope
                        with widespread insurgency without external assistance.</p>
                    <p>58. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Latin American desire to stay clear of
                        a nuclear power struggle has resulted in a Nuclear Free Zone (<gloss target="#t_NFZ1">NFZ</gloss>) Treaty having been agreed to by most Latin
                        American countries. The <gloss target="#t_NFZ1">NFZ</gloss> will undoubtedly
                        come into existence but the Treaty is worded so that there should be no
                        adverse effect on US transit and overflight rights. However, there are other
                        important factors associated with this Treaty, such as extravagant
                        territorial sea claims, which are potentially inimical to US interests.</p>

                        principal objective of US military strategy is the deterrence of aggression
                        at any level, with emphasis on deterrence of strategic nuclear attack on the
                        United States since national survival would be clearly in jeopardy. Should
                        deterrence fail, the principal objective of US military strategy is the
                        termination of hostilities under conditions of relative advantage while
                        limiting damage to the United States and minimizing damage to US and allied
                        interests. Accordingly, the three basic elements of the US strategic concept
                        are collective security, credible deterrence, and flexible response.</p>

                        particularly through mutual efforts to counter threats posed by the Soviet

                        eliminate internal weaknesses and instability which attract and facilitate

                            participation should be based upon the degree to which US interests are
                            involved; the threat; and the willingness, desires, and capabilities of

                            execution choices as to countries and tasks under varying conditions of
                            war outbreak. Under all conditions, US strategic offensive and defensive

                                    conjunction with land, air, and amphibious operations, mid-range
                                    strategy should give greater emphasis than heretofore to the

                                    short of a major war in continental Europe. In this context, the
                                    strategy should provide for a naval posture with a recognizable
                                    capability to deter or respond to any hostile act or threat of
                                    aggression at sea with a degree of force sufficient to oblige
                                    the aggressor to choose between intensifying the confrontation,

                            North Vietnam, and North Korea while assisting in the defense of free

                        <item>An example of the types of conflict for which US forces must be
                            provided in the mid-range period is the current war in Southeast Asia,
                            the successful prosecution of which requires the maintenance of
                            simultaneous pressure against all elements of the enemy’s war-making
                            capability. In South Vietnam, this involves extensive ground, air, and
                            naval operations against the Viet Cong/North Vietnamese main forces and
                            major base areas, while continuing political, social, and economic
                            development and vigorous offensive operations against Viet Cong
                            provincial forces and guerrillas. Against North Vietnam this involves a
                            comprehensive and coordinated air/naval campaign which will: (1) bring
                            military pressure on its internal war-supporting resources; (2)
                            effectively impede the importation of external resources; and (3)

                            Cambodia, and along the coast. This strategy envisions a degree of
                            pressure which is beyond the enemy’s capability to accommodate and seeks
                            the following military objectives: (1) to make it as difficult and
                            costly as possible for North Vietnam to continue effective support of
                            the Viet Cong and to cause North Vietnam to cease direction of the Viet
                            Cong insurgency; (2) to defeat the Viet Cong and North Vietnam forces in
                            South Vietnam and force the withdrawal of North Vietnam forces; (3) to
                            extend Government of South Vietnam domination, direction, and control
                            over <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0621"/>South Vietnam; and (4) to

                            United States must retain bases in Panama in order to ensure that US

                        with assured destruction elements. An effective damage-limiting capability
                        requires a combination of offensive forces, ballistic missile defense, air
                        defense, space defense, antisubmarine warfare (<gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>) forces, and civil defense. A force of survivable strategic
                        offensive forces, intelligence and early warning systems, strategic
                        defensive forces, command and control systems, and effective passive defense
                        measures will strengthen the credibility of the US deterrent against attacks
                        on the United States and its allies. This in turn will strengthen the
                        assurance that the fear of escalating nonnuclear conflicts works to the
                        advantage of the United States. A proper mix of US strategic offensive and
                        defensive capabilities would tend to make increased defensive efforts and
                        expenditures the enemy’s preferred response option, and would exact greater
                        direct and indirect attrition of the enemy’s attack, so as to reduce the
                        potential for damage to the United States and its allies if deterrence
                        fails.</p>

                        force to the assured destruction task. These forces must be survivable,
                        continue to be maintained in a high degree of alert, and must be capable of

                        obtain technical intelligence, to perform mission identification, to monitor
                        arms control agreements and treaties, and to provide strategic warning.
                        During hostilities, surveillance must provide tactical warning. In the
                        exercise of command and control, surveillance is required to insure that US
                        forces and resources are employed with maximum effectiveness. This
                        surveillance should provide indications of enemy strategy, and knowledge of
                        enemy tactics, order of battle, and the effectiveness of enemy and US
                        weapons. Timely and precise analysis of the relative success of an exchange
                        is required so that the best interests of the United States can be served in
                        controlling the progress of hostilities and achieving advantageous war
                        termination. These missions will require aircraft, satellite systems, ocean
                        surveillance systems, and other systems and sensors.</p>

                    <p>74. (S) General purpose forces, supported by appropriate strategic mobility
                        capability, are an integral part of the over-all US deterrent posture. They
                        constitute the principal means to meet threats at levels less than strategic
                        nuclear war. Their capabilities also provide options to deter and coerce the
                        enemy. General purpose forces will usually operate in association with
                        allies, under the collective security and forward defense aspects of the
                        strategic concept. This requires consideration of allied or other friendly
                        in-being and potential force capabilities. Whenever feasible, these
                        capabilities should be developed as the first line of defense against
                        aggression. US military assistance should be considered in that context.</p>
                    <p>75. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) Active and Reserve general purpose
                        forces should be balanced in combat capability and sufficient in quantity,
                        quality, mobility, and logistic support to provide forward deployed forces
                        and a strategic reserve of US-based forces which, in conjunction with allied
                        forces, can assure the defense of key strategic areas and essential <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s, and respond to contingency situations.
                        They should be supported by appropriately structured strategic lift forces
                        and pre-positioned materiel, and include a training, replacement, and
                        rotation base in the United States for deployed forces.</p>
                    <p>76. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) General purpose forces must be capable
                        of operating in a nuclear or nonnuclear environment. They should be equipped
                        with <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0626"/>both single-purpose and
                        dual-capable weapons systems for air, land, and sea operations. These should
                        include air and missile elements on quick reaction alert. Tactical nuclear
                        capabilities should provide a variety of options for responding to,
                        initiating, and waging nuclear warfare at all levels below strategic nuclear
                        war. They must be capable of selective application for military advantage in
                        circumstances where significant military gain without further expansion of
                        conflict is likely. In addition, they should be capable of conducting
                        military operations in strategic nuclear war in conjunction with strategic
                        offensive and defensive forces.</p>

                        be a continuing requirement for a substantial US military presence in and
                        around Europe facing the Warsaw Pact. Even after the Vietnam conflict has
                        ended, substantial deployed forces, including forces afloat, and land and
                        sea-based prepositioned equipment and supplies will be required in the
                        Pacific-Asian area to face the Soviet and <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> threats and to contribute to area stability.</p>
                    <p>78. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) US military forces must be capable of
                        employing chemical and biological weapons, of conducting operations in a
                        toxic environment, and of defending against their use by an enemy.</p>
                    <p>79. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Unconventional warfare forces should
                        be prepared to exploit the resistance potential in areas which are denied to
                        the United States, overrun, or likely to be overrun by enemy forces. US
                        personnel should have the capability to assist indigenous elements in the
                        creation, support, and direction of capabilities to conduct guerrilla
                        warfare and other unconventional operations to reduce the enemy’s combat

                        controls in hostile areas. Means should also be provided to assist in
                        evasion and escape of US and allied military personnel and other selected
                        individuals from enemy-held territories.</p>
                    <p>80. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In all types of conflict, military
                        psychological operations to support national and military objectives should
                        be planned and conducted in coordination or integrated with like operations
                        of governmental and nongovernmental agencies and/or friendly indigenous
                        assets.</p>

                        into and operation in areas in which bases are lacking, relatively austere,
                        or hastily prepared, and be capable of conducting amphibious and airborne

                        Active element of the force. The balance between Active and Reserve

                    <p>84. (<gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss>) The combination of Active and Reserve
                        forces, augmented by further mobilization of military and industrial
                        resources, must provide the capability to carry out US strategy throughout
                        the full range of potential conflict situations that confront the United
                        States. As substantial uncommitted Active land, sea (including amphibious),
                        or air forces are deployed in response to contingency situations, additional
                        forces must be readied so that the United States continuously has sufficient
                        forces to be capable of initiating or responding to, on a timely basis, an
                        expansion of conflict in area, type, intensity, or duration, or of
                        responding to an unforeseen contingency. Such forces should be maintained
                        for the duration of the contingency/conflict.</p>
                    <p>85. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) General purpose force level objectives
                        should be determined in consideration of the foregoing capabilities and
                        should be keyed to military contingencies which have a reasonably high
                        probability of occurrence, singly or simultaneously. Accordingly, based upon
                        the basic military objectives, threat appraisal, strategic concept, and risk
                        assessment, such contingencies govern the design of general purpose forces.

                    <p>90. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) It is in the US interest to provide
                        selected countries with military assistance, while recognizing that local
                        forces are not always a substitute for US forces. National needs should be
                        considered carefully in providing assistance and the level and type of aid
                        set accordingly, recognizing that there are limits on the US ability to
                        control its use. Most important, local forces should be assessed
                        realistically and considered in conjunction with US resources in determining
                        US strategy, preparing US military plans, and analyzing US force level
                        objectives. Likewise, when determining the level and type of assistance to
                        be provided in country and regional military aid programs, it is important
                        to examine the role of local forces in US strategy and plans, together with
                        political and economic factors affecting their use. In the underdeveloped
                        countries, the military assistance program should also be designed to
                        complement the civic and economic development of the country and to improve
                        receiving, staging, and operating facilities that contribute to US strategic
                        mobility requirements.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> welcomed Minister
                        Hellyer and referred to their previous conversations on the question of
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s.<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed
                            the question of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s with Hellyer and

                        He wanted to continue those consultations because we are now on the point of
                        announcing publicly the deployment of a light <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>

                    <p>He noted that for some time the research and development on such a system had
                        been going forward and had now developed to the point where decisions were
                        possible. He said that we had continued to press the Soviets for discussions
                        which might lead to some kind of agreement on limiting such deployment but
                        that the Soviets were defensive about it. In response to Mr.
                            <persName>Hellyer</persName>’s question, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he was certain such
                        discussions would be taken at some time in the future. However, at the
                        moment, he said, Viet-Nam stands in the way. He noted that Kosygin had been
                        pressed very hard on this at the time of the Glassboro Summit and had given
                        a more or less propagandistic reply. We shall, however, continue to press
                        the Soviets and will press it again this week with them.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that our
                        current budget had several hundred million dollars for the development of an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. We have stated publicly
                        that, depending on the outcome of talks with the Soviets, we might or might
                        not use such funds to protect offensive weapons.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">See, for example, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s statement before a subcommittee of the Senate

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that the
                        engineering development of an American <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system had only recently progressed to the point where a production decision
                        was possible.</p>
                    <p>He said, however, that today we have reached that point and expressed his
                        satisfaction at the high quality of people and contractors working on the
                        system. He said that the difference between today and the past is that we
                        now have the Chinese threat and an engineering design which permits those in
                        authority to make the decision to proceed with production.</p>
                    <p>He stressed that we had not yet made a final decision on this but believes we
                        will announce such a deployment next week.<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s

                    </p>
                    <p>He said that the purpose of the system is to protect the American population
                        against a Chinese attack in the mid-1970’s and to provide some protection
                        for our offensive weapons against Soviet attack.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then asked Mr.
                            <persName>Foster</persName> to describe the system.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> said that two elements were involved—radars
                        and missiles. [<hi rend="italic">6 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>] This radar is used to guide the interceptor to the
                        impact point.</p>
                    <p>The interceptor is the Spartan which has a yield of [<hi rend="italic">3

                    <p>Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> noted that the system we proposed to deploy
                        would [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not
                        declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>He said that the eye of the system is the radar. To deny the enemy an
                        opportunity to attack them, [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> stressed that the system is an area defense.
                        There are only a few sites covering the whole country. He said, however,
                        that the system does not provide coverage in depth for our strategic
                        offensive weapons. Therefore, we have considered this problem and have
                        decided to put Sprints in to protect a goodly number of our Minutemen.</p>
                    <p>The cost of the entire system, he said, is about five billion dollars.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we were
                        proceeding to undertake consultations with our other allies.<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">Regarding these consultations, of which the present
                            meeting was a part, <ref target="#d192">see Document 192</ref>.</note>
                        He said that we would also be talking to the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                        North Atlantic Council tomorrow. He then asked if the Canadians had any
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that all equipment
                        would be in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed that this
                        is a United States financed and oriented system and that we felt it provided
                        an optimum degree of protection for the United States. One by-product,
                        however, is some protection for Canada.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then read off the
                        cities in Canada which would be protected—[<hi rend="italic">2 lines of
                            source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>He reiterated that all of these would be protected and that this is a
                        by-product of the U.S. system. He said that we could modify the U.S. system
                        at extra cost to provide greater coverage for Canada. If Canada wants
                        greater benefits, however, she must share in the cost and make an early
                        decision. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stressed that
                        a Canadian decision by the end of this year would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> what the cost might be. Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, before responding to
                        the query, noted that Rand, on a recent study of the differences between
                        cost estimates and actual costs on military contracts, found that the actual
                        costs generally exceeded the estimates by 300 to 1,000 per cent. Hence the
                        Canadians should be aware that the costs will be high. Current estimates for
                        the American system are $4 to $5 billion. To increase the Canadian coverage
                        would cost an additional $1 billion. This would give [<hi rend="italic">less
                            than 1 line of source <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0635"/>text not
                            declassified</hi>] coverage in Canada. It was stressed, however, that
                        these are unescalated figures.</p>
                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2–1/2 lines of source text) not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, again speaking of
                        costs, said that we could reduce costs by reducing the coverage of the
                        entire system. He said that we could achieve a 20 per cent reduction in
                        costs by reducing coverage by 5 per cent. But this, of course, would raise
                        political problems as part of the population would be left out of the
                        coverage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> said that there was no political problem in
                        Canada now with regard to an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, because at
                        the moment Canada is violently anti-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. But
                        he noted this might change.</p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer’s comment led Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to talk about this attitude in the context of the
                        development of neo-isolationism. He noted that this was caused by our view
                        that our allies are standing back from what we regard to be joint
                        responsibilities. He felt that an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        deployment system could determine a country’s inclusion or exclusion from
                        world affairs. In the case of Canada, he cited particularly Asian
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer said that he agreed with Mr. <hi rend="italic">McNamara</hi>
                        on neo-isolationism but felt that the current attitude on such things in
                        Canada at the moment was determined by Viet-Nam.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> cited the reaction
                        of our allies in connection with the Middle East. He said that they had just
                        walked away from the situation. He cited all this to indicate that the
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> would have an influence, albeit
                        minor, on all this.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked how coverage is determined.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> said that it was related to population
                        density and that to cover Canada would not expose U.S. cities.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we need
                        to know soon if the Canadians want to join because plants must be built from
                        the ground up in order to supply the components of the system.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question by Minister Hellyer, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the deployment of this
                        system will not lead to the deployment of a Soviet-oriented system. He said
                        that it is not intended to move toward a heavy system and stressed that
                        deployment of this system is not the first step in the deployment of a
                        larger system.</p>
                    <p>In support of this, Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> said the proposed system
                        protects all of the United States but it does have some technical
                        limitations. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines of source text not

                    <p>Basil Robinson asked what difficulties would ensue if Canada waited two or

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that there
                        would be greater cost.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked, if Canada participated in the
                        system, could some of the equipment be produced in Canada. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we hadn’t looked into
                        this but he doubted it.</p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer asked if there was an altitude limitation on explosions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>

                        embrace the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s, or it could be assigned
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer noted that to put it in <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss>, or even to suggest putting it in <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> at this time, would complicate
                        consideration by the Canadians of renewal of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>When asked whether or not there was a strong possibility of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s being related to <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that depended upon Canada.</p>
                    <p>He also noted, in response to Minister Hellyer’s inquiry, that there was no
                        overlap between the Air Defense System and the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s because they were independent systems.</p>
                    <p>When asked if there would be any savings from having the two systems thrown
                        together, Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> said that he did not know of any
                        such savings.</p>
                    <p>In response to Mr. <persName>Armstrong</persName>’s query, Mr.
                            <persName>Foster</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems would operate against submarine missiles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> asked why we had to protect missile farms.
                        He said that he thought he remembered Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> saying at the last consultations that these farms
                        did not need protection.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that there
                        were two options available here. We could either expand the offensive system
                        or defend the present offensive system. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">U.S.S.R.</gloss> is expanding their offensive system, so we must insure
                        ourselves. We are buying insurance by the protection of the missile farms.
                        Essentially, we are looking toward the time in the future when Soviets
                        expand both their offensive and defensive systems beyond the present <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> threat limits.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> asked about the influence of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system on the Air Defense System and the
                        relationship envisaged. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that at this level they were unrelated. China
                        has no air threat. He <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0637"/>noted that
                        other factors threatened the Air Defense System and not this one. We have
                        problems in the Air Defense field which we want to discuss soon with the
                        Canadians.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> asked how we prevent atomic bombs from being
                        brought into American ports in boats.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we just
                        have to depend primarily upon intelligence. He also noted, however, the
                        degree of intimidation in such a situation would be limited in view of our
                        ability to retaliate.</p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer said that he wished to speak for a moment on the situation
                        in Canada.</p>
                    <p>He said that he believed that Canada would be able to renew the <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> agreement without inclusion of any
                        reference to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s. If <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s are introduced into the agreement,
                        however, it would jeopardize approval of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>He said that the feeling against <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>’s is so
                        strong in Canada at the present time that there is an inclination, on the
                        part of some members of the government, that when Canada renews the <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss> agreement, the government should issue
                        a statement saying that it will not involve itself in a system at the
                        present time.</p>
                    <p>Concluding, he said that at the moment there is “absolutely no chance” of
                        Canadian involvement in the U.S. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.
                        His conclusion was that there was no more than one chance in a hundred of
                        getting a decision for such participation.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Ritchie asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> when the announcement would be made. The Secretary
                        replied on Monday.<note n="6" xml:id="d190fn6">September 18.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Minister Hellyer noted that this announcement, plus having all the hardware
                        in the United States, plus reassuring statements on fallout effects, would
                        serve to clear the air in Canada and make for a much more rational
                        discussion. Then the Canadians could talk of real plans and not hypothetical
                        situations. He noted that the Canadians themselves had been doing some
                        studies on the effect on Canada of the deployment of an American system. He
                        had been discussing these with some Parliamentarians. He felt that the U.S.
                        announcement would facilitate better understanding of the problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that Minister
                        Hellyer could publicly state that he had been consulted by the Americans
                        about this deployment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> also noted that, with regard to <gloss target="#t_NORAD1">NORAD</gloss>, the Canadian position will be
                        officially given at the Permanent Joint Defense Board (<gloss target="#t_PJDB1">PJDB</gloss>) meeting next week. (Basil Robinson
                        revealed after the meeting that the Cabinet was convening to discuss this
                        issue this afternoon.)</p>
                    <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0638"/>
                    <p>At this point there was a brief discussion on the possibility of expanding
                        the coverage of the U.S. deployed system by lowering the detonation ceiling
                        from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. The point made here was that while the ceiling is
                        now at the higher level it could be lowered and increased coverage obtained,
                        but other problems would ensue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked if Defense Research Board experts
                        could come down and talk to Mr. <persName>Foster</persName> about the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he was
                        delighted but that the classification on the system was exceedingly
                        important and this must be given every consideration.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked what the system did in terms of
                        preventing casualties.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reviewed the
                        probable outlook for a Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        deployment and said that our estimates were that without an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, and in the event of a Chinese
                        attack, we might suffer a [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>]. With the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system he said this loss would be practically zero.</p>
                    <p>He did note, however, that if the Chinese force expands—its missiles rising
                        from 75 to 100—we would have to expand our own system in order to keep the
                        casualty figure down low.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the Soviets, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that we must be wary of regarding the system
                        as giving much help against the Soviets except from the standpoint of
                        defending our missile farms. He said that the Soviets, if they attack, would
                        launch sufficient weapons to do considerable damage.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName>Armstrong</persName> asked if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> still would adhere to his
                        philosophy that we could offset any Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied in the
                        affirmative. He said that we must exercise the offensive and take advantage
                        of every technological development to be able to penetrate the Soviet
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> asked if he could do anything further for
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. The Secretary
                        replied in the negative and said that he was very glad to meet with the
                        Canadians and that their officials would be welcome when they wished to come
                        down here.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Hellyer</persName> said that he thought the announcement would
                        come as no surprise and will definitely facilitate rational discussion.</p>

                        <item>Deterrence of Strategic Nuclear War, and Damage Limiting</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I am concerned about our general approach to the problem of deterring
                        strategic nuclear war, and I am also concerned about the relation of our
                        damage limiting capability to deterrence and to planning for actual war
                        fighting should deterrence fail.</p>
                    <p>In my view, deterrence will depend on a Soviet judgment not only of their own
                        losses but also of relative US losses and surviving military capability. The
                        political stakes and the nature of the Soviet leadership will also be
                        important. In some future equivalent of the “Cuban missile crisis” 20%
                        Soviet fatalities might not be enough, if US losses would be 80%. Soviet
                        leaders might believe that the US would cease to exist while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could successfully recover, using
                        surviving nuclear forces to dominate the European industrial complex.</p>
                    <p>Our evaluation should consider possible surprise Soviet tactics as well as
                        force capabilities: pin-down, <gloss target="#t_FOBS1">FOBs</gloss>, cruise
                        missile submarines, medium bombers, and coordinated offensive/defensive
                        operations. My feeling is that we have become too theoretical—that our
                        calculations are too removed from the most likely patterns of admitted
                        unlikely wars, and hence from the probable Soviet judgments which determine
                        deterrence.</p>
                    <p>I believe we should consider a new criterion for deterrence. We should try to
                        insure that Soviet losses would be at least as severe as US losses in any
                        strategic war, and that the resultant surviving military balance would not
                        be in favor of the Soviets. With regard to this latter point, I recognize
                        that there are arguments both pro and con, but feel that it deserves our
                        serious consideration.</p>
                    <p>Further, we should examine our forces in the light of how they would perform
                        if a strategic exchange began, using various scenarios for its beginning. I
                        suggest that under such circumstances the execution of the option to destroy
                        Soviet population and industry would be our poorest choice. Rather, we would
                        probably act to maintain the threat of such assured destruction while
                        operating our forces to minimize Soviet potential for destruction on the US
                        urban/industrial complex. A force <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0640"/>planned for that purpose could well look very different from one aimed at
                        preserving assured destruction in the face of a “Greater Than Expected”
                        Threat.</p>

                    <p>Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        proposed to include an announcement of the Johnson administration’s decision
                        to deploy an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system in an upcoming
                        address before the United Press International Editors and Publishers in San
                        Francisco on September 18, 1967. For <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s early thoughts on the purposes of this speech,
                        see <ref target="#d185">Document 185</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In an August 8 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
                        Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_WPC2">Paul Warnke</persName> advised
                        that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s speech should say
                        only that he was leaning toward a THIN–X and a China-oriented <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment, “but avoid making a firm
                        commitment to proceed with a deployment,” which, he felt, should wait until
                        the President’s budget message in January. He added that such a postponement
                        would allow time for consultation with U.S. allies, “who are undoubtedly
                        still relatively unfamiliar with the arguments favoring deployment of a
                        THIN–X system, as opposed to a Soviet-oriented deployment.” He went on to
                        remind <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> that he had promised
                        Canadian Defense Minister <persName>Paul T. Hellyer</persName> that he would
                        consult with him before any U.S. decision was made, and he outlined how the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies as well as Japan and other
                        Pacific allies could be consulted. At the least, he believed that if
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> announced the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment in his September speech, the
                        administration should first undertake urgent consultations with Canada and

                        Francisco speech, <persName corresp="#p_WPC2">Warnke</persName> offered four
                        initiatives to prepare U.S. allies in advance for this eventuality. None of

                    <p>Meanwhile, on August 9 <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                        circulated a draft of his speech to key principals in the Johnson
                        administration. In an August 16 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> commented that the draft was “a
                        masterful job.” He wondered, however, if <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had to be so specific regarding <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment in the speech when “we are
                        committed to consult further with our allies and in particular with the
                        Nuclear Planning Group,” which would not meet until September 28–29. He
                        suggested that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> intimate in
                        his address only that the administration was “moving in the direction of a
                        thin deployment, stopping just short of announcing a final decision.” Among
                        a few other suggestions, he also warned against emphasizing the Chinese
                        nuclear threat as a reason for the decision. “It might be better,” <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> cautioned, “to balance the
                        protection of our offensive missiles with the protection against the Chinese
                        threat.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>Under cover of an August 19 memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> forwarded the August 9 draft of his speech to the
                        White House. In this memorandum <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> quoted <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>’s suggestion to delay final announcement of the
                        decision, but added, “I disagree. We are prepared now to make the decision
                        and I believe we must make it. If we decide to go forward with the ‘thin
                        deployment’ but fail to announce the decision, we are placing ammunition in
                        the hands of our critics who will use it for partisan purposes.” The
                        President initialed the draft, presumably indicating his approval, but he
                        also asked for comments on the draft from Joseph Califano. (Johnson Library,

                        1967 [2 of 2], Box 12) Califano generally endorsed its contents, but thought
                        that there should be a statement in the speech or in an accompanying
                        announcement of the budgetary impact of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decision. He wanted to consult with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> before the speech was given on how
                        to handle its impact domestically, “since all hell is likely to break loose
                        from the liberals and the urbanists.” (Memorandum from Califano to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, August 27; ibid.)</p>

                        and <persName corresp="#p_FAS2">Fisher</persName>, however, he opposed an

                            <p>“I still think that the decision is premature, politically as well as
                                technically, and that, if it is made this year, it should be as part
                                of the regular budget cycle. A decision in mid-September will focus
                                all attention on this issue in isolation from other military
                                hardware decisions; and in its present form I am afraid it will meet
                                strong objections from all sides. The anti-<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> forces will consider it a foot in the door, and the

                                a grossly inadequate system which fails to protect the U.S.
                                population against the Soviet threat. Technically, I think there are
                                some unanswered questions as to how well and how long this system
                                would actually deal with the early Chinese threat.”</p>

                        these statements will antagonize rather than convince Congressional critics,
                        and I am sure that they will complicate any possible discussion of the issue
                        with the Soviets.” He argued that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should instead “emphasize not our strategic

                        understand it will include a new program for North American air defense and

                    <p>In your <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> memorandum2 the analysis
                        supporting the retirement of the <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>
                        carriers and the transfer of their mission to aircraft operating from land
                        bases abroad argues that insurance against the loss of a few bases, such as
                        the Azores, is not a sufficient case for maintaining and modernizing the
                        carrier forces since there will be other bases available. I am less sanguine
                        than you are about the prospects five years hence of being able to use all
                        of the primary or secondary <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> bases you
                        cite, and I think we may have to face more than the loss of just a few bases
                        over the next five years. Thus I think it could be a mistake to plan any
                        long term increase in our dependence on foreign bases for a major function
                        such as <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As you know a joint State-Defense base study is to get underway in January.
                        It should throw some light on the likely availability of <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> bases. A final decision on the carriers
                        might if possible be deferred until the study’s findings are available and
                        can be assessed by our staffs.</p>

                        if this would be useful to you. It is my feeling that the argument for the
                        program will be most effective if it emphasizes our need for these ships to
                        support our normal overseas deployments and long standing commitments,
                        rather than the great advantages they offer for meeting a broader range of

                    <p>My review of the Department of Defense military program and financial budget
                        for the next fiscal year has proceeded to the point where I can present
                        certain conclusions to you. Preliminary estimates indicate that the military
                        forces (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">Not printed.</note> and
                        procurement programs which I recommend for your approval will require new
                        obligational authority for Military Functions, Military Assistance, and
                        Civil Defense of $79–82 billion for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69.

                        $16–19 billion, my recommended force structure is based on requirements for
                        national security and has not been limited by arbitrary or predetermined
                        budget ceilings. In my review of the Service proposals, I attempted, as last
                        year, to eliminate all non-essential, marginal, and postponable programs
                        with the objective of minimizing the costs of supporting the required
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>In developing the program and reviewing the budget proposals, I have had the

                            recommend procurement of 25 CH–46 helicopters for the reserves at a cost
                            of about $50 million, in addition to 130 helicopters I recommend buying
                            for the Marines in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 at a cost of
                            about $180 million. (Procurement of all new aircraft for the Fourth
                            Marine Air Wing would add about $1 billion to my recommended plan over

                            and I recommend against this procurement because, without it, we are
                            greatly increasing the total tactical airpower and helicopter lift
                            capability of all of our forces, including the Marine Corps, and because
                            we believe the total inventory of Marine aircraft is adequate. Moreover,
                            our general policy is not to buy new aircraft for reserve air forces.
                            Under our recommended plan, from 1961 to 1971, the destruction
                            capability of the Marine fighter and attack forces will increase more
                            than fourfold and the helicopter troop lift capability will increase

                    <p>Dr. <persName>Foster</persName>, the Director of Research and Engineering,
                        has informed me that a properly defined and substantiated joint-Service plan
                        for F–X/VFAX has not yet been developed. Several important issues have not
                        yet been resolved including the extent to which the two Service versions can
                        be common, the size of the crew, and the extent to which all-weather
                        air-to-ground electronics should be included. The recommended $60 million
                        will support an extensive experimental effort in avionics and propulsion to
                        help resolve these issues and to reduce program risks, permitting start of
                        full-scale development in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70.</p>
                    <p>In addition although the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> do not recommend

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said this is the
                        annual meeting with the President to review budgetary issues which the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> feels are important enough to
                        discuss with the President.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">General Wheeler</persName> said the Joint Chiefs
                        of Staff had two very long and productive sessions with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> concerning U.S. strategic forces
                        and general purpose forces.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">See <ref target="#d195fn3">footnote 3, Document 195</ref>.</note> He said
                        there are only four issues which will be brought to the President’s
                        attention, and one has no impact on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        ′69 budget.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">General Wheeler</persName> said this has been
                        the most far-reaching and most extensive exchange of views the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has had in the four years he has
                        participated. He said that budget decisions are still being considered, so
                        it does not necessarily mean that additional questions will not be brought
                        to the President’s attention in the future. He said the questions before
                        them today concern force modification and force structure. This does not
                        affect Southeast Asia operations.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said there is
                        disagreement on whether we should have a new advanced strategic bomber in
                        1976. He says the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> believe we should have
                        one and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> does not
                        believe we should have one.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he believed
                        General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> presented the
                        issue well. He said by 1976 we would have 465 bombers including B–52s and
                        FB–111s. In 1976 there will be 1542 missile launches “on line,” and 8,190
                        separately targetable bombs or warheads.</p>

                    <p>The National Intelligence Estimates (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>) are
                        that our forces could adequately destroy Soviet capabilities as currently
                            programmed.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">A reference presumably to <ref target="#d183">Document 183</ref>.</note> If the Soviets go beyond
                            <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> estimates, we go to what is called
                        “greater than expected” threats. Even in the event that the “greater than
                        expected” threat develops, we still have means of coping with this
                        situation. These include adding the Spring Defense to the Minuteman system;
                        the addition of hardened silos for the Minuteman missile; adding 150 more
                        Minuteman missiles; and the addition of newer missiles to the B–52
                        bomber.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> did say that it is
                        better to have these new bombers than to have to modify the system were the
                        “greater than expected” threat to develop.</p>
                    <p>The President asked how much this would cost. General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said it would range up to 7–½
                        billion dollars for 150 aircraft, but the amount asked for in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′69 was only $40 million for contract
                        definition.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he would
                        recommend only about $25 million and that this would delay the bomber
                        program about a year. Under his plan, the current force would be modified
                        and the $7–½ billion investment would not be necessary.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said it was his
                        judgment that the bomber is superior in “sure destruction” of cities than is
                        the missile. He recommended going to the contract definition on the bomber
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he felt that
                        the threat is not realistic. If it does not develop we will not need the
                        bomber. “I say we stand a good chance of not having to spend the $7 billion.
                        We are talking about 1976. We do not know what the Soviets will do between
                        then and now.”</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said there is some
                        difference of opinion about the assumptions built into this which leads to
                        the figures given in the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> estimate.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said the newest
                        B–52 will be fourteen years old in 1976. “I believe we will need a new
                        bomber by then.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he did not
                        think a new bomber would be necessary.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the next issue
                        was the modernization of the Fourth Military Air Wing. He said this is a
                        reserve wing.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said that a later
                        type aircraft is needed in this wing. He said, for example, they have no
                        planes in this wing which can fly in storms or at night and there are no
                        photo reconnaissance aircraft. He also said there is a shortage of
                        helicopters in this wing and that more were needed.</p>
                    <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0670"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said that about 23
                        fixed wing aircraft and 25 choppers would be required to bring this wing up
                        to par with the other wings. The budget request for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ′69 would be $130.1 million and the projected cost for the
                        total project would be $631 million. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he did not believe that it was necessary.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> agreed with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said it was a matter
                        of what the President wanted this wing to be capable of doing in the event
                        it were to be needed in actions independent of Vietnam. “If they are going
                        to operate independently they are not able to do the job with the current
                        equipment.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the wing was
                        ready to go if necessary.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said the wing has
                        only thirty choppers.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked how many
                        choppers did it have three years ago?</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said there were none
                        three years ago.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that was just
                        the point—there has been significant modernization in the wing during the
                        last three years and that choppers could be reallocated in the event this
                        wing were to be activated for duty.</p>
                    <p>The President asked if the Defense Department was doing all it could to get
                        choppers to Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that indeed
                        there was every priority given to putting more choppers into Vietnam. He
                        said there now was a problem of parts, and there may be a need to shift the
                        tension from choppers to parts. He said, in fact, that there were more
                        choppers than could be used well.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said there are 140
                        choppers per month coming into Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there was
                        chopper pilot problems now. He said the need is for more roads in Vietnam so
                        that much of the travel which is now by chopper can be handled on roads. In
                        fact, he said that much of the movement could be handled more efficiently on
                        roads rather than by chopper.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Komer</persName> and Ambassador Bunker asked
                        for $65 million in road money but that he could only give $40 million.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_GGWMJ1">Greene</persName> said that if we have
                        another crisis somewhere else in the world we would not have this Marine
                        wing equipment well enough to sustain itself.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked for more
                        time to study this problem. He said it was his impression that the wing was
                        not able to sustain itself.</p>
                    <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0671"/>
                    <p>Admiral <persName>Moorer</persName> said there is a need for a new tactical
                        fighter. He said the F–4 is being used as a first line fighter. There is a
                        need for a general purpose fighter for both services. He said that the
                        services were asking for $100 million for contract definition and that there
                        is no dispute for a need for a fighter. The dispute is over the amount.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said Admiral
                            <persName>Moorer</persName> stated the case well. There is a need for a
                        modern fighter. He said the difference between the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the Secretary is over $60 million versus $100
                        million.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we will go as
                        fast with money as decisions can be made, but that he would be inclined to
                        leave the budget figure at $60 million.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName> said that the $100
                        million figure would permit them to overcome any differences in design or
                        contract definition.</p>
                    <p>Admiral <persName>Moorer</persName> said that the Secretary had agreed to
                        make up any difference out of funds, were more than $60 million required, so
                        that was satisfactory to him.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_JGHK1">Johnson</persName> said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> expected questioning on the differences
                        between their position and that of the Secretary of Defense on the need for
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses. He said the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> still favors a heavy defense while the
                        Secretary favors a thin defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the arguments
                        are well known. The Joint Chiefs are saying they haven’t seen anything to
                        change their views and I certainly have not seen anything to change
                        mine.</p>
                    <p>The President urged that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the
                        Secretary try to reconcile their differences before testifying. He pointed
                        out the bad results which came out of the Stennis hearings this past
                            session.<note n="4" xml:id="d196fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                        “These differences permit them to propagandize that we have deep divisions
                        between the civilian and military leadership. I certainly have seen no
                        evidence of that while I have been here. I think you all are superior and
                        stable and dependable.</p>
                    <p>“However, you must take into account not only what you say but the effects of
                        what you say. You must keep in mind the relation between the military
                        committees of Congress and the Chief Executive. Some committee chairmen
                        think they should run the strategy of the war rather than the President. I
                        base this on all my years in the Congress. We do want the understanding of
                        the committees, but it does not strengthen our system to air our
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>“I am pleased and proud of your performance, your competence, and your
                        dedication.</p>

                        agreement, including Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, on how to proceed with
                        respect to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.</p>
                    <p>Your decision is required over the weekend because the deadline for informing
                        the organizations in New York is, apparently, December 18.</p>

                            <p>Under existing New York law the two organizations would not have to

                                to find in the year ahead an alternative way to keep them in

                                favor of a simple statement to the effect that with the
                                terminations, certain funds had been provided, but there should

                                organizations, specific contributions had been made to various
                                valuable institutions until such time as adequate legislation or new

                                that the Department had the choice, as the deadline neared, of

                            <item>The question was raised as to the timing of the two radios filing

                                the surge-funding figure would only appear in the 1968 declaration
                                in early 1969. The inference here was that the main objective was to
                                smoothly sail past the election date in the fall of 1968.</item>

                            <item>The point was made that the directors of the radios should be
                                informed that their statements, preferably brief (left to their

                            stand. Mr. <persName>Tovar</persName> noted that every effort had been
                            made to cover the field; he could assure the chairman that every major
                            project and expenditure in this field had been examined, that there
                            might be bits and pieces and marginal efforts which had not yet been
                            prepared for screening. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> implied that in the marginal field there might be
                            some potential cliff hangers, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> directed that a list of these be prepared promptly
                            for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> so that he would
                            know what could be expected on forthcoming agendas in the grey area. Mr.
                                <persName>Tovar</persName> noted that the review of the marginal
                            projects was a continuous year-round process and was not limited to a
                            specific search scheduled to end 31 December.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bob:</p>

                        appreciated. In my earlier letter I said I would defer until later comment
                        on the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>s dealing with Strategic Forces
                        and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I have now completed my review of
                        these latter memoranda.</p>
                    <p>I have no specific suggestions for changes in this year’s force decisions. I
                        do have some thoughts on the effect of our foreign relations of projected
                        future trends in our strategic force posture and what we say about this
                        posture. I believe it would be more useful, however, to comment on these in
                        terms of a study which my staff recently completed rather than on the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>s themselves.</p>
                    <p>Several months ago I requested an assessment of the foreign policy
                        implications of recent and projected changes in US and Soviet military
                        forces, with particular emphasis on the strategic forces. I enclose a copy
                        of that study.<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">The Department of State staff
                            paper, entitled “A Study of US-Soviet Military Rela-tionships 1957–1976:
                            Foreign Policy Implications,” December 18, included three attachments:
                            “Comparisons and Trends,” “Soviet Appreciation of the Emerging Military
                            Balance,” and “US Strategic Views.” The study and attachments are not
                            printed, but a Defense Department summary of the paper is printed
                            below.</note> I would very much appreciate your comments on it.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that many of the issues raised in this study require further
                        examination. However, I do think the study highlights the importance of what
                        we say about our strategic posture because of the way in which these
                        statements may be interpreted both by the Soviets and our allies. In
                        particular I think we should try to lead discussions away from such
                        oversimplified concepts as “superiority” or “parity.”</p>
                    <p>I am sure you agree that it is important that we carefully coordinate the
                        statements which we make to Congress on this score as we have done in past
                        years. To this end I have asked Phil Farley to be in touch <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0678"/>with your staff on the posture statement
                        and to focus particularly this year on the strategic forces portion of that
                        statement as well as the review of the international situation.</p>
                    <p>With warm regards,</p>

                            RELATIONSHIPS</p>
                        <p>The central theme of the studies is that the US Government should take a
                            fresh look at the political and military implications of the growing
                            strategic parity and changing US-Soviet strategic relationships. The
                            State papers suggest that this can be done through: 1) <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> arrangement for contingency planning on
                            where and how the Soviets would be most likely to intervene in local
                            conflicts, and 2) joint State-Defense development of rationale for US
                            strategic forces, focusing on the rhetoric of deterrence and the major
                            asymmetry in US-Soviet strategies and postures between offense and
                            defensive oriented systems.</p>
                        <p>The substantive points of the studies fall into three categories: 1)
                            strategic nuclear relations, 2) problems created by increased Soviet
                            strategic mobility and 3) <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>On strategic nuclear relations, intelligence estimates point to increased
                            Soviet capability to damage the US in a nuclear exchange, and, over the
                            next decade, the expectation that continued Soviet expansion of their
                            strategic forces may lead to their surpassing the US in some categories
                            of strategic strength. While perceptions of these matters are probably
                            more significant than the “actual” balance, these trends, State
                            tentatively concludes, do not now or in the next five years seem to
                            jeopardize the US deterrent. The problems will not likely be deterrence,
                            but a) increased US domestic controversy, b) uncertainties and pressures
                            leading to “worst case” assumptions in budget planning, c) complications
                            on non-proliferation given obvious vulnerability of US to nuclear
                            attack, and d) greater Soviet inclination to intervene in third
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>It is this last problem coupled with gradually increasing Soviet
                            strategic mobility that may be of more immediate concern. Evidence of
                            extensive worldwide naval activity, expansion and modernization of <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0679"/>airlift-sealift capabilities,
                            allowing for distant but limited operations may tempt the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to be more responsive to requests
                            from governments and factions for military support.</p>
                        <p>On the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> part, the Soviets have
                            maintained superiority in Central Europe and have modernized their
                            forces (including tactical nuclear weapons). But with US realization
                            that we were not far behind conventionally, the consensus is that a
                            Soviet attack on Western Europe is unlikely. The problem, however, is
                            that the over-all US-Soviet strategic relationship may cause our allies
                            to be more deferential to Soviet political pressures, leading to a
                            further European questioning of the reliability of US commitments.</p>

                            to as Committee “B”, has been responsible, since its inception in 1953,
                            for considering ways and means of safeguarding against the clandestine

                            matter and as nuclear proliferation becomes an increasing problem, they
                            propose that, as a second phase of the study effort, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff would review the findings of the <gloss target="#t_ICIS1">ICIS</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_IIC1">IIC</gloss> in the

                            conducted in coordination with your staff, would provide the basis for a
                            report to you on the military aspects of the problem and possible

                            present Minuteman deployment at a cost of $40 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69 and a total cost of $212 million in

                    <p rend="center">I. The General Nuclear War Problem</p>
                    <p>The main objective of our nuclear forces is to deter nuclear attacks on the
                        U.S. Our ability to strike back and destroy Soviet society makes a Soviet
                        decision to strike the U.S. highly unlikely. By choosing to develop and
                        deploy harder-to-attack forces, we can reduce even more the likelihood of
                        such an attack. Unable to destroy most of our nuclear striking power, the
                        Soviets would gain little by striking first.</p>
                    <p>Although the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> are strongly
                        deterred from nuclear attacks on each other, a nuclear war anywhere in the
                        world could lead to a war—and most likely a nuclear war—between the two
                        countries. Thus to avoid a nuclear war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, we try to make all nuclear wars unlikely. This objective
                        includes: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>Like us, to deter a first-strike nuclear attack, the Soviets maintain the
                        ability to strike back and destroy our society. When they take steps to
                        reduce the damage that we can inflict (e.g., by deploying <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s), we react to offset these steps. I
                        believe that the Soviets would react in the same way to similar U.S. steps
                        to limit damage to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Our analysis shows that the Soviets can protect their second strike
                        capability against any threat we might pose. Since a second strike
                        capability is vital to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, I believe
                        they will insure the survival of this capability. Convinced that the Soviets
                        would counter a major U.S. attempt to take away their second strike
                        capability, we have chosen not to start a major Damage Limiting program
                        against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0685"/>
                    <p>These considerations lead us to depend upon deterrence to keep the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from attacking us. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] conversely, we
                        can buy an effective defense of <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> as
                        insurance against a failure of deterrence. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line of source text not declassified</hi>] allow us to develop an
                        effective defense against her nuclear attack capability into the 1980s.</p>
                    <p>What if deterrence fails and a nuclear war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> occurs? If the war began with an all-out Soviet attack,
                        including our cities, we would reply in kind. If the war started with less
                        than an all-out attack, we would want to carry out plans for the controlled
                        and deliberate use of our nuclear power to get the best possible outcome.
                        The lack of such nuclear war plans is one of the main weaknesses in our
                        posture today.</p>

                    <p>Numbers of missile launchers and bombers are a poor measure of the relative
                        capabilities of U.S. and Soviet strategic forces; total megatons are worse.
                        Yet these measures are frequently used in drawing comparisons between U.S.
                        and Soviet nuclear capabilities. The important question is not total
                        megatons or numbers of delivery systems, but whether our forces can
                        effectively carry out their missions—Assured Destruction and attacks on
                        Soviet forces to limit damage. Factors such as accuracy, reliability,
                        survivability, and control are decisive in evaluating the effectiveness of
                        our forces. Our missiles appear to be more reliable than Soviet missiles;
                        they are more than twice as accurate. In 1972, programmed U.S. missile
                        forces could destroy some 700 hardened targets. The expected Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force could destroy only some 300 such
                        targets.</p>
                    <p>We are buying large numbers of smaller, accurate weapons because they better
                        meet our strategic objectives—even while reducing total U.S. megatons. The

                    <p>Such calculations have convinced me and the Services of the superiority of
                        Multiple Independently-targetable Re-entry Vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) over single, large megaton weapons for
                        attacking cities or military targets, defended or otherwise. Therefore, the
                        best way to increase the effectiveness of our forces is by putting <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s on Minuteman and Poseidon.</p>
                    <p>During 1964–65, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> maintained small
                        silo (SS–11)<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> construction starts at the
                        rate of about 150 launchers per year. It doubled this <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0687"/>rate during the first half of 1966, then
                        returned to the original rate. The SS–9 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment appears to have stopped except for filling out
                        groups already under construction.</p>
                    <p>A new solid-fueled Soviet missile has been identified. Present intelligence
                        estimates assume it is an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, which will
                        come into the Soviet inventory as a supplement to (rather than a replacement
                        for) the SS–11.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have continued to test Fractional Orbit Ballistic Systems (<gloss target="#t_FOBS1">FOBS</gloss>), which would be useful in an attempt to
                        deny warning to our strategic bombers, if we took no counter actions.</p>
                    <p>A recent re-evaluation of the present Soviet submarine force indicates about
                        20% fewer operational Soviet ballistic missile submarines than previous
                        intelligence estimates. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is,
                        however, now making operational a new class of large, nuclear-powered,
                        ballistic missile submarines to carry sixteen 1,000 to 2,000 nautical mile
                        (NM) missiles. Intelligence estimates project ten to thirteen of these ships
                        in service by mid-1971 and 35 to 42 by 1976. Diesel-powered Sea-Launched
                        Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>) submarines no
                        longer are estimated to be part of the Soviet threat to the U.S.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets also appear to be pursuing two advanced defensive programs: (1) a
                        long-range anti-<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system around Moscow
                        with about 100 launchers, and (2) a system across European <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (the Tallinn system or SA–5) with about
                        3,000 reloadable launchers, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. We expect both systems to become partially
                        operational this year. There are conflicting intelligence evaluations of the
                        Tallinn system. While it appears to be designed for air defense, the system
                        could have some capabilities against ballistic missiles. The <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> estimates the system is designed entirely
                        for air defense, while a dissenting view emphasizes a dual air
                            defense/<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> role. Since last year, the
                        dissenting view has lost ground as we discovered that the defensive missile
                        is much too slow to intercept missiles successfully, and the engagement
                        radars have little capability when operating independently against ballistic
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>We still have seen no evidence of Soviet development of a good low-altitude
                        Surface-to-Air Missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>). However, the
                        Foxbat Interceptor is now estimated to have a limited “look-down,
                        shoot-down” capability.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese were expected to begin operational deployment of a Medium Range
                        Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>) with a fission
                        warhead in 1967, but did not do so. China also has under development a much
                        larger and more complex missile system, possibly an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. They were expected to complete a large facility for large
                        launchers late in 1967, but did not do this either. It appears that they are
                        about six months behind the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> schedule
                        that we had previously estimated, which would still allow an initial
                        operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment in the early
                        1970s.</p>

                    <p>We deter a rational enemy from launching a first strike against us by
                        maintaining a strong and secure ability to retaliate under any
                        circumstances. We measure our second strike ability in terms of Assured
                        Destruction—the capability to inflict unacceptable damage, calculated under
                        extremely conservative assumptions, on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, even after sustaining a surprise Soviet first strike. I
                        believe that our ability to kill from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                        enough to deter the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from launching a
                        first strike against the U.S., even in extreme situations.</p>
                    <p>However, our Assured Destruction capability does not indicate how we would
                        use our forces in a nuclear war. We must design our forces to cope with many
                        situations, including a war which neither side intended. We reduce the
                        likelihood of such a war by keeping tight control over U.S. forces under all
                        circumstances; by maintaining communications at all times with our forces,
                        the governments of our Allies, and, as appropriate, our enemies; and by
                        retaining options in selecting appropriate responses. If we failed to deter

                        existing systems. We should develop new systems only as options which would

                        materializes, we can, by later investment, develop these options fully. (No

                    <p>If the Soviets do not react by developing and deploying these <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, we can defend Minuteman at less cost
                        than we could procure Poseidons. If they develop a small <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> threat, the cost of Minuteman defense
                        would about equal the cost of acquiring Poseidons. Super-hard silos for
                        Minuteman are not competitive with a light Minuteman defense, but they offer
                        an alternative to heavier Minuteman defenses against the small-<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> threat. A posture combining defense
                        (calling for small-<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) and super-hard
                        silos (calling for very high yield warheads) would be very difficult to
                        attack. None of the new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s enjoys a
                        clear cost advantage over defending Minuteman, putting Minuteman <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0695"/>in super-hard silos, or acquiring Poseidons
                        until the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> becomes much stronger
                        than the greater-than-expected threat.<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">This
                            might happen sometime after 1976. Thus, in order to provide a basis for

                            Advanced Development of a new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> is
                            still desirable. Furthermore, the submarine-carried Advanced <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> has some promise of eventually
                            replacing Poseidon, in the 1980s, on an equal-cost basis. [Footnote in
                            the source text.]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>If we choose to buy more Poseidon, we would have to order them in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71,
                        before we could see the extent of the Soviet threat. If we develop
                        super-hard silos, we would not have to decide to deploy them until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73.</p>
                    <p>A defense of Minuteman can be bought in stages and is likely to hold down the
                        total cost of hedging our Assured Destruction capability. To deploy the
                        heavy defense of Minuteman by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 76, we would
                        have to decide on the light defense by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70,
                        the median defense by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71, and the heavy
                        defense by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73. Other hedges, such as more
                        Poseidon submarines or the Ballistic Missile Surface Ship, are unnecessary.
                        Super-hard silos can be built in response to the threat and they are
                        competitive with the defense of Minuteman. The choice between super-hard
                        silos and defense of Minuteman depends on the direction the Soviet threat
                        takes. To preserve the option to go either way, we should develop them
                        both.</p>

                    <p>Recent studies have reviewed the value of a mixed ballistic missile/bomber
                        force against reasonable projections of Soviet defenses into the 1970s. They
                        show the bombers add some measure of assurance against greater-than-expected
                        Soviet threats and induce the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                        divert resources to their anti-bomber defenses. A mixed offensive force
                        enjoys certain advantages against terminal defenses. By attacking some
                        cities with missiles only, and others with bombers only, we force the
                        Soviets to use more resources to protect all defended cities with both
                        bomber and missile defenses. In order to accomplish this objective, however,
                        we do not need large bomber forces.</p>
                    <p>The previous section discussed the hedges to our programmed strategic
                        offensive forces, especially to their missile components. Since we intend to
                        keep the missile force well-hedged, the issue is whether we also want to
                        hedge our bomber force with an <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Is an <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> a good hedge? It is not. Against
                        the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> range of threats our programmed
                        forces are adequate. Since the strategic forces are already well-hedged, we
                        can keep an Assured Destruction capability against greater-than-expected
                        threats without the <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>To counter a Soviet greater-than-expected threat, under most circumstances,
                        including the most probable ones, U.S. offensive forces <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0696"/>equipped with <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> cost more than forces with equivalent effectiveness but
                        without the advanced bomber.</p>
                    <p>What does <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> cost as a hedge? To answer
                        this question we must compare the cost of bomber forces needed to cope with
                        various levels of Soviet threat. The following two tables make this

                        can use as a hedge. It costs $2.9 billion more than the programmed forces.
                        The all-<gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> Force E costs considerably
                        more than either Force A or C, $9.4 and $1.3 billion respectively.</p>
                    <p>Considerations other than costs make the Force D option less attractive than
                        Force C. First, developing <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> requires a
                        longer lead <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0697"/>time than deploying
                            <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>s on B–52s, and imposes a
                        substantial initial investment before we could determine that an increased
                        Soviet threat has occurred. Conversely, since the <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> option has a shorter lead time, we can delay the decision
                        to deploy this missile until the increased threat begins to appear.
                        Secondly, if we decide to proceed with <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>
                        now and the greater-than-expected threat does not appear, we will have
                        wasted $3 to $10 billion.</p>
                    <p>In sum, to achieve equal effectiveness, <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>
                        contributes only marginally at great cost. Thus, Engineering Development is
                        not called for now. However, we should proceed with Advanced Development to
                        provide aircraft technology and to keep open the option of replacing the
                        B–52s.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Our Assured Destruction capability makes any kind of nuclear war with the
                        Soviets unlikely. Therefore, we first buy enough forces to give us high
                        confidence in our deterrent. As insurance in the unlikely event deterrence
                        fails, we then consider adding forces that might reduce damage to our
                        population and industry. Damage Limiting forces, unlike those for Assured
                        Destruction, cannot and need not work perfectly under all conditions. They
                        should insure against the more probable risks, such as wars growing out of a
                        deep crisis, or threats posed by the growth of Chinese nuclear forces. The
                        basic Damage Limiting question is whether we should deploy Nike-X in defense
                        of our cities.</p>
                    <p>A defensive system to save U.S. cities from a Soviet nuclear attack must
                        attempt to keep ahead of the Soviet threat, including their reactions to our
                        deployment. In this analysis we use two stages in such a deployment. The
                        first, “Posture A”, represents a light defense of cities. It has an area
                        defense of the entire <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>, providing
                        overlapping coverage of key targets. It has a relatively low-density Sprint
                        defense of 25 cities. It is estimated that initially it would cost about $9
                        billion in investment and $600 million a year to operate. The second,
                        “Posture B”, is a heavier defense with a higher density Sprint defense of 52
                        cities. It is estimated that initially it would cost $18 billion and $1.1
                        billion a year to operate. Because of probable Soviet reaction, with Posture
                        B we would also need improved air and civil defense and <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces at a cost of $4 to $5 billion in
                        investment. Moreover, experience convinces me that the pursuit of effective
                        defenses would eventually lead us to spend about $40 billion.</p>

                    <p>This table shows that if the Soviets do not respond, they lose their
                        deterrent. They would be forced to react to increase the ability of their
                        forces to survive and strike back. They could do so in several different
                        ways: (1) by stepping up deployment of SS–9s and SS–11s now in production;
                        (2) by defending their present missile force; (3) by adding <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, chaff, or other penetration aids to
                        their missiles; (4) by deploying a new, large <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> (either mobile or defended); or (5) by deploying a new
                        submarine-launched missile like our Poseidon. They have the technical
                        capability to do any of these things by the mid-1970s.</p>
                    <p>If the Soviets choose to respond to our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        with <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s, penetration aids, and missiles

                        and 550 against Posture B), they would regain their Assured Destruction
                        (second strike) capability. A larger Soviet response could raise probable
                        U.S. fatalities still higher.</p>

                    <p>As part of their response, the Soviets could add large numbers of offensive
                        missiles that would threaten our Assured Destruction capability. We, in
                        turn, would have to react. Viewing each other’s buildup in forces as an
                        increased threat, each side would undertake counteracting steps, thereby
                        increasing the costs to both with no gain in security. Therefore, I believe
                        deploying the Nike-X system to protect American cities would be neither wise

                    <p>Civil Defense provides low cost insurance for our people in the unlikely
                        event of a nuclear attack. As a by-product it has also proven to be a
                        significant aid in natural disasters. This program should be pursued. More
                        effort is needed to identify useful shelters in home basements. This can
                        fill a large part of the current shelter deficit at a very low cost—about
                        $0.45 per space added.</p>

                    <p>The number of lives which would be saved by air defense if the Soviets were
                        to attack the U.S. depends on our ballistic missile defense. With only a
                        light missile defense, even a very strong air defense could not save many
                        lives. The Soviets could simply target cities with their missiles. A Soviet
                        first strike, with missiles only, could kill 120 million people; their
                        bombers could then add less than ten million fatalities <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0700"/>even if we had no air defense at all. A
                        force of either 200 improved F–106 interceptors with <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> (ten-year cost $9.9 billion) or 54
                        F–12s with <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> (ten-year cost $11.6
                        billion) would reduce these fatalities by less than five to eight
                        million.</p>
                    <p>However, there are other objectives of continental air defense which must
                        also be considered. These include defense against countries other than the
                        Soviet Union, defense against bomber attacks on those strategic forces that
                        we withhold in a controlled nuclear war, peacetime patrolling of our air
                        space, discouraging Soviet bomber aspirations, and the use of continental
                        air defense forces in missions outside the U.S. We can achieve these
                        objectives with a modern, more effective air defense force that costs less
                        over the next twelve years than our present force. This modern force will
                        consist of 200 improved F–106 fighters (the F–106X), 42 <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss>, two <gloss target="#t_OTH1">OTH</gloss> radars, and the Federal Aviation Agency National Air Space
                        system for back-up command and control. The cost through 1979 for the modern
                        force is $13.7 billion compared with $13.9 billion for the current force.
                        However, the lower operating costs of the modern force will result in
                        substantial savings over the present force after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 79.</p>
                    <p>Surveillance is presently the weakest part of our air defense system.
                        Therefore, we should proceed with engineering development of <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> (if the Overland Radar Technology
                        program is successful) and with development of back-scatter <gloss target="#t_OTH1">OTH</gloss> radars. We should also develop, and deploy
                        on the F–106, advanced air-to-air missiles and an advanced fire control
                        system. With these improvements to the F–106, there is little to be gained
                        from the high performance characteristics of the F–12. Thus, we can avoid
                        the additional $1.7 billion cost of an F–12 force and still meet our air
                        defense objectives.</p>

                        1970 due to technical difficulties. The reprogramming has caused a reduction
                        of [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] in the number of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                        bombs approved by you on 10 June 1967, for inclusion in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968 stockpile. This reduction has been

                    <p>The proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 operational stockpile,

                    <p>The production proposed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 represents
                        the continuing program to improve our nuclear weapons posture by modernizing
                        existing weapons (Minuteman II), and by providing new warheads in support of
                        new capabilities (Poseidon, Minuteman III, FB–111) to be introduced
                        concurrently with the phase-out of older systems. The proposed reductions
                        include some obsolescent weapons in excess of present requirements (Davy
                        Crockett tactical missiles and Lulu depth charges); those warheads being
                        replaced during modernization actions (Minuteman and Polaris); and other
                        weapons whose programmed inventory can no longer be operationally justified
                        (strategic bombs and surface-to-air missiles). The detailed composition of
                        the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 stockpile is shown in Column 4 of
                        Inclosure 1. The incremental changes in warhead quantities required during

                        operational stockpile, and shown as Inclosure 2, are non-nuclear components
                        which provide different operational capabilities for the same warhead and/or

                    <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed the nuclear weapons stockpile through

                    <p>In addition to the operational stockpile (Inclosure 1), warheads required for
                        the quality assurance and reliability testing programs are shown in
                        Inclosure 3. These additional warheads are needed to offset reductions in
                        operational capability during stockpile sampling programs, joint firing test
                        programs, and foreseeable major retrofit actions requiring temporary and
                        permanent withdrawals from the operational stockpile. For strategic missiles
                        we provide warheads to offset temporary and permanent withdrawals. For other
                        systems we allow a decrease in the operational stockpile for permanent
                        withdrawals for testing, unless this can be offset by delayed retirements
                        or, in the case of warheads still in production, by additional production.
                        Withdrawals for non-destructive testing, limited to a small percentage of
                        the warheads concerned, are permitted to temporarily decrease the
                        operational stockpile. Additionally, warheads for systems being phased down

                        may be realized thereby, mainly by reducing the requirements for rebuild of
                        warheads subsequent to future planned quality assurance tests. Finally,
                        warheads are provided in this category when dictated by unusual
                        circumstances such as foreseeable major retrofit programs or in cases

                    <p>The proposed <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 stockpile is within the
                        presently projected availability of special nuclear and by-product
                        materials, and the number of weapons recommended to be produced in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 is within the planned capability of the
                        Atomic Energy Commission weapons fabrication system. An Atomic Energy

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                            increasingly concerned about the state of US worldwide military posture
                            when measured against existing commitments and likely contingencies.
                            This memorandum is intended to provide you with a current appraisal of
                            the worldwide US military posture and to express concern about the
                            limited capability of our military forces to respond rapidly to crisis
                            situations.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Prior to the commitment of major
                            forces to Southeast Asia in 1965, the major deployable general purpose
                            forces based in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>, Hawaii, and
                            Okinawa included 9–1/3 Army divisions, 2–8/9 Marine Corps division/wing
                            teams, nonforward-deployed Navy forces, and approximately 48 Air Force
                            tactical fighter squadrons. Meeting the requirements of the extended
                            contingency in Southeast Asia has resulted in a reduction in the number
                            of forces available to reinforce forces now deployed and for other
                            contingencies as well as reduced combat readiness. At the present time,
                            none of the <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>-based land forces
                            are deployable within existing tour/rotation policies and without
                            extension of terms of service. After the approved deployments under
                            Program 5 and Program 6 have been made, the only Air Force tactical
                            fighter and reconnaissance units which will be available for immediate
                            deployment are two F–100 tactical fighter squadrons and two
                            reconnaissance squadrons ordered to active duty from the Air National
                            Guard. Further, the deployment to Southeast Asia of the equivalent of
                            10–2/3 Army and Marine Corps division forces, one-half of the Marine
                            aircraft squadrons, major surface and air forces of the Navy, and major
                            tactical and strategic elements of the Air Force exceeds the force level
                            which can be sustained by the existing active force structure under
                            current tour/rotational policies. The Air Force must also sustain the
                            forces deployed, for a yet-undetermined period of temporary duty, to
                            northeast Asia in response to the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Shortages in personnel with the
                            required skills, shortages in critical items of equipment, and the
                            inability of units to attain the necessary <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0706"/>training level are the primary reasons for the limited
                            deployability of the forces remaining within the strategic reserve. In
                            addition, the combat readiness of forces deployed in other forward areas
                            has been lowered substantially since they have been required to
                            contribute heavily in both personnel and equipment to support and
                            sustain Southeast Asia deployments.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) It is the decreased readiness of
                            US military forces worldwide and the limited capability of the strategic
                            reserve that most concern the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Further, the risks
                            associated with the current military posture and the possibility of
                            communist-inspired diversionary contingencies erupting elsewhere
                            increase as the commitment in Southeast Asia is prolonged and the active
                            US military resources are further extended. Accordingly, the following
                            assessment is provided: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Strategic</hi>. Though this appraisal is
                                    primarily concerned with general purpose forces, the principal
                                    threat to the United States is the large and rapidly improving
                                    strategic offensive forces of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Soviet policy is clearly aimed at improving
                                    the strategic position of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> relative, to the United States. It is noted
                                    that the current level of fighter/attack and B–52 sortie rates
                                    in the western Pacific and the additional deployments of
                                    aircraft to Korea have resulted in a <gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> degradation of about 250 alert weapons
                                    programmed against more than 200 targets.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Europe/Middle East/North Africa</hi>. The most
                                    likely pressure points for Soviet diversionary efforts are
                                    Europe, the Mediterranean, north Africa, and the Middle East.
                                    The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military posture,
                                    already weakened by France’s nonparticipation, is being
                                    jeopardized further by proposed US, British, and Belgian troop
                                    reductions and redeployments. In addition to the Soviet
                                    capability to strike in Western Europe, particularly against the
                                    vulnerable Benelux line of communication (<gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>), the Soviet naval presence in
                                    the Mediterranean, together with Soviet aid to certain Arab
                                    States, provides added opportunity for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to promote incidents in these
                                    areas. The United States must be able to respond to direct or
                                    indirect aggression in the Middle East and north Africa without
                                    significant drawdown on US forces in central Europe. The
                                    significance of the threat in these areas is increased by our
                                    limited capability to provide the forces required for the
                                    initial defense of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                                            division(-) will require a minimum of 12 weeks after
                                            mobilization to achieve a deployable status. Due to the
                                            reduced readiness of these three divisions, the United
                                            States has agreed to make two airborne divisions, the

                                            6 months, the 101st Airborne Division and one brigade of
                                            the 82d Airborne Division were deployed to Southeast
                                            Asia. The readiness of the 82d Airborne Division(-) was
                                            reduced in preparing this brigade for deployment, and
                                            the division(-) will require 8 weeks’ training after
                                            receipt of replacements to achieve a deployable status.
                                            Provision of these replacements will not be completed
                                            until October 1968, unless there is a Reserve callup.

                                    circumstances considered essential principally to US national
                                    interest. Therefore, a capability still must be maintained for
                                    direct intervention—through the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>, if possible, but unilaterally if necessary—to
                                    prevent establishment of another Castro-style communist
                                    government in the Western Hemisphere. Cuba continues to pose a
                                    threat to US security interests, and the US base at Guantanamo
                                    presents an opportunity for diversionary action by the

                            considerations that must be recognized. Many major cities in the United
                            States are threatened with civil disturbances stemming from racial
                            disorders and antidraft/anti-Vietnam movements. Forces from the Ready
                            Reserve and <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>-based Active Forces
                            will be capable of coping with these threats. However, the simultaneous
                            employment of Reserve forces, under State or Federal control, in a
                            number of different cities, or the prolonged use of Active Forces in
                            this role would reduce the capability to reinforce forces now deployed
                            and to respond to other contingencies.</item>

                            However, it is considered prudent that there be no relaxation of efforts
                            to attain an improved military posture while awaiting results from those
                            steps. Past experience provides ample evidence that negotiation with the
                            communists is conducted best when backed by visible and credible
                            force.</item>

                    <p>At the recent meeting of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, several
                        matters occurred to which I wish to call your attention.</p>
                    <p>The first is the attached memorandum to the President suggesting that he
                        issue a statement with regard to the importance of the foreign intelligence
                            effort.<note n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">Dated April 15 on a list of
                            attachments at the end of the letter; not found.</note> The Board is
                        taking inventory of its own resources <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0711"/>and methods in the hope of providing better service to the
                        President in the intelligence field and would appreciate the reinforcement
                        afforded of such a statement by the President. Would you please forward it
                        to the President?</p>
                    <p>As a result of the inventory mentioned above, the Board has reorganized its
                        panels as indicated in an enclosure hereto.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">Dated April 17 on a list of attachments at the end of the letter; not
                            found.</note> The regional panels now coincide territorially with the
                        interests of the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>’s and the regional
                        Assistant Secretaries of State.</p>
                    <p>In considering how best to keep an eye on the covert activities of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, the Board felt that it would be timely at
                        our next meeting in June to review activities of the 303 Committee in
                        keeping tabs on the Agency. We hope that you will be willing to attend and
                        give us your impression of the effectiveness of the 303 controls. The
                        meeting will be held on June 6–7 and I hope that you will be able to spend a
                        little time with us on one of these days. I shall confirm this invitation
                        later in writing.</p>
                    <p>You are well aware of the excellent work being done by <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> in intercepting and deciphering the low
                        level infiltration and logistics traffic of the North Vietnamese.
                        Unfortunately, a great deal of this traffic is not intercepted because of a
                        lack of <gloss target="#t_SIGINT1">SIGINT</gloss> aircraft with this primary
                        mission. Pat Carter has been trying in vain to obtain a total of 15 aircraft
                        for this purpose but, thus far, he has been frustrated, largely by the issue
                        of operational control of aircraft on this kind of collection mission—shall
                        that control be military or <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>? The issue
                        is set forth in the attached letter which I hope you will be willing to
                        dispatch to <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clark Clifford</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">Not found.</note> In the past, the latter has
                        always been sympathetic to the needs of <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>
                        and I would expect him to react quickly to such a letter and cut the red
                        tape which has thus far held back this much needed reinforcement in the
                            <gloss target="#t_SIGINT1">SIGINT</gloss> field.</p>
                    <p>I am sending these matters over in writing which normally I would have taken
                        up with you in person because of your absence in Honolulu and my departure
                        on a short trip which will last until April 25. I shall be back in my office

                        transit rights), political alignments, or for other reasons, the United
                        States must pay special attention to these countries and to the ability of
                        their governments to maintain internal order. In certain circumstances, the
                        United States may have to provide governments with assistance for internal
                        defense purposes in order to help protect <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0713"/>United States local and strategic interests which might be
                        threatened by internal disorder or subversion. Subversion involves
                        systematic efforts from internal or external sources to undermine or
                        overthrow the established political and social order. Internal defense
                        consists of the full range of action programs to maintain internal security,
                        including, in addition to political and diplomatic activity and economic and
                        military assistance, such specialized programs as civil police,
                        psychological, paramilitary, and counterinsurgency operations;
                        counterguerrilla activity, unconventional warfare, military civic actions,
                        and public works.</p>
                    <p>In some developing countries, independence from significant influence or
                        control by a foreign power may be a major U.S. security objective for
                        political, military, or economic reasons. Such control or influence could
                        result from communist subversion or from communist exploitation of local
                        failure to maintain adequate internal security.</p>
                    <p>The United States must, therefore, be constantly alert to conditions of
                        internal security in developing countries in order to identify situations
                        where subversion, insurgency, or disorder endanger significant U.S.
                        interests. In these cases, the United States must be prepared to assist
                        governments in appropriate internal defense programs.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">B. The U.S. Position</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is a part of our overall foreign policy that ultimately nations be able to
                        develop according to their own traditions and that each be governed in
                        accordance with the will of the majority of its citizens. We believe that
                        governments should respond adequately to the aspirations of the people for
                        political, economic, and social conditions appropriate to their environment,
                        and should move toward the establishment of institutions which will provide
                        some guarantees for the continuation of these conditions as governments
                        change. The development of institutions responsive to local national
                        patterns of behavior is more important, however, than progress toward an
                        objective goal of representative democratic institutions as the United
                        States has traditionally viewed them. In many cases, it is primarily the
                        economic and technical aspects of modernization which are attractive goals
                        in developing countries, and there is often great resistance to changes in
                        political and social systems, no matter how important or appropriate these
                        changes may seem to us.</p>
                    <p>The process of modernization in developing countries is often destabilizing
                        in itself, and changes in political and social systems often are
                        accomplished by revolutionary activity. While the United States would
                        usually prefer basic changes in a society to be evolutionary rather than
                        revolutionary, the growth process is generally accompanied by unrest,
                        upheaval, and violence. In U.S. policies toward foreign internal security
                        situations, it is important to make a distinction <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0714"/>between disorder and insurgency which may
                        be a function of national growth and that which is a result of
                        subversion.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the position which the United States should take with respect to the
                        internal security situation in a foreign country is an integral, inseparable
                        part of the overall U.S. policy toward the country and the region in which
                        it is located. It cannot be formulated in isolation from other aspects of
                        U.S. policy nor implemented as a separate program. The policy problem is to
                        make judgments about the nature and speed of the process of national
                        development and, where U.S. interests require it, to find ways to influence
                        the process constructively.</p>
                    <p>The United States does not regard every situation of political instability or
                        social disorder and violence as a foreign internal security problem
                        threatening U.S. interests and requiring U.S. assistance for internal
                        defense programs. In some cases, the forces making for instability and
                        political upheaval may contribute, in the long run, to the achievement of
                        objectives deserving of encouragement and support from the United States. In
                        any case, it does not seem possible entirely to deprive people of the use of
                        force for purposes of social change, and action which is too repressive may
                        worsen the problem by forcing the pressures for alterations in institutions
                        outside legal or acceptable channels and into subversive forms.</p>
                    <p>In countries where significant U.S. interests are not threatened by internal
                        disorder or subversion, the United States should seek to avoid becoming
                        involved in internal defense policies, plans, and operations of local
                        governments. Even in these cases, however, it may be in the U.S. interest to
                        provide internal defense equipment or training assistance appropriate to the
                        situation and to U.S. objectives in the countries concerned.</p>
                    <p>Internal defense policy and programs for countries the United States may be
                        prepared to assist will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis and
                        carefully tailored to the specific and unique aspects of each situation.
                        Important considerations which will affect the determination of the kind and
                        nature of U.S. internal defense policy and programs for particular countries
                        are: first, U.S. interests in the area; then the sources, kinds, and degree
                        of threat to internal security; dangers from external exploitation; the
                        possibility of local conflict broadening into larger-scale wars; the
                        consequences of the internal security problem for overall development within
                        the country; the will and ability of the local government to handle the
                        situation with indigenous resources; the effect of U.S. programs on other
                        programs within the country; the consequences of U.S. policies and programs
                        on the U.S. position in other countries; the availability of external
                        assistance from other nations or international organizations.</p>
                    <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0715"/>
                    <p>One of our primary concerns is to anticipate situations requiring U.S.
                        foreign internal defense action far enough in advance, and to devise in
                        cooperation with local governments, effective programs which will make
                        unnecessary the engagement of U.S. combat troops. The long-term implications
                        of use of U.S. military forces should be carefully studied in any
                        consideration of such a step.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">C. The Importance of Local Efforts</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The process of change within a country is largely stimulated by local
                        initiative, guided by national leaders, reliant on indigenous resources, and
                        ultimately bears a national trademark. The role of internal defense is to
                        permit the changes to take place in as orderly a manner as possible and
                        without outside interference. The kind and amount of police and military
                        action required to maintain internal security for each country are most
                        likely also to be determined according to the character of the government
                        and the people and the requirements for such force as seen by them. It is
                        clear that the United States should persuade the countries concerned to do
                        as much as they can for their own internal defense. We should realize,
                        however, that many resource-poor countries are unable to attain their goals
                        for political and economic modernization or their objectives of improved
                        conditions of law and order without external help. Where U.S. interests
                        warrant it and U.S. resources can be made available, the United States can
                        provide such assistance or, in combination with other nations which share
                        our common goals, see that it is provided.</p>

                    <p>The nature of the U.S. response toward foreign internal security situations
                        may be a selection from or mix of the following policy options: <list>
                            <item>—non-involvement</item>
                            <item>—diplomatic persuasion, either bilateral or through regional
                                groupings, and advice (including efforts to influence opposition
                                groups or leaders where appropriate)</item>
                            <item>—special technical, economic, public information, civil security,
                                police or military assistance to include operational assistance for
                                internal defense programs and psychological operations</item>
                            <item>—assistance as a means of inducing policies designed to counter
                                underlying causes of internal security problems</item>
                            <item>—boycott of a government through denial of normal diplomatic or
                                economic relations</item>
                            <item>—use of military force to assist in restoring or maintaining
                                internal order.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>It will always be necessary for responsible U.S. officials both in Washington
                        and in the field to make judgments, in individual country situations,
                        concerning the character of U.S. action and the degree of U.S. <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0716"/>assistance which may be desirable (from the
                        U.S. point of view or the country’s own standpoint) or tolerable or
                        effective or available. Judgments of the appropriateness of political,
                        military, economic, and psychological activities must be applied on a
                        continuing basis as the situation in a country changes or develops.</p>
                    <p>Political development programs to provide for improved communication between
                        the population at large and the central government can strengthen nations
                        vulnerable to subversion and unrest. Encouragement of increasing popular
                        involvement and wider participation in indigenous private and government
                        institutions can induce people to seek desired social and economic
                        opportunities and reforms through overt legal means rather than through
                        subversion and violence. Such institutions as local development committees,
                        regional councils, and rural production and marketing cooperatives may act
                        as effective vehicles for participation in local and national development
                        programs leading to the evolution of self-reliant societies resistant to
                        subversion and insurgency. Legal development and public administration
                        programs also may contribute to the achievement of this goal.</p>
                    <p>Effective police and public safety activities can play an important part in
                        the prevention and handling of internal security problems. A capable and
                        humane police force can be invaluable in coping with and controlling
                        internal security situations at minimum cost with limited use of force and
                        within the framework of civil law. It can be a factor in preventing
                        dissension and dissatisfaction from growing outside the bounds of legitimate
                        opposition and becoming subversion. In developing countries, U.S. police
                        assistance programs can play an important role, not only in the preservation
                        of public order, but in the building of indigenous civil security
                        institutions which can keep pace with and assist in the nation’s growth
                        process. The effectiveness of public safety forces can be greatly enhanced
                        if programs for their development are instituted in advance of potential
                        crises. Such programs may be justified also to keep developing countries
                        from obtaining police assistance from Communist or other countries hostile
                        to the United States. Among the responsibilities which the indigenous
                        security agencies can be brought to assume are the protection of broadening
                        freedoms and the prevention of crime and terror which jeopardize the
                        freedoms and interfere with national development. Public information
                        programs can facilitate public acceptance of this role for the police.</p>
                    <p>The armed forces of a developing country can constitute the means for
                        protection against internal insurrection beyond the capability of civilian
                        police to control. The existence of loyal, appropriately trained, and
                        effective military forces can represent an important deterrent against
                        terrorism or guerrilla warfare and is an important element in internal
                        defense planning. In addition, in many countries, the military <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0717"/>establishment possesses equipment and
                        skills representing a major national investment and resource. Frequently the
                        United States can influence governments to use this resource in the nation
                        building process without detracting from the capability of the military to
                        perform its primary defense function.</p>
                    <p>Students, other youth groups, and labor are often prime target groups for
                        local programs. The United States may be of assistance through these groups
                        in promoting social progress in the developing society. Opportunities may
                        also exist for influencing opposition leaders where Communist or other
                        adverse influences seem likely to prove too disruptive.</p>
                    <p>Information activities, both person-to-person contact and mass media can play
                        a significant part in the communication process by creating a favorable
                        climate for change and self-help and providing facts and focus for political
                        dialogue. There may occasionally be opportunities for the resources of U.S.
                        business firms and philanthropic foundations to be applied in support of
                        U.S. objectives. Many private U.S. firms and foundations engage in programs
                        to improve social and economic conditions in countries abroad and can
                        usefully be encouraged to provide assistance and to adopt employment
                        practices which will identify them with popular improvements and aspirations
                        in support of U.S. goals.</p>
                    <p>Considerations affecting the level of U.S. assistance when provided, include
                        the availability of U.S. and indigenous official and private resources, the
                        financial and manpower impact of U.S. assistance on local governments, and
                        opportunities to obtain assistance from third countries or international
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>The choice of U.S. programs and the determination of levels will also be
                        influenced by the degree of identification with the local government we are
                        willing to accept. In most cases, we will want to do everything possible to
                        see that critical sectors of the local society understand the role that the
                        United States is seeking to play. Psychological operations and information
                        programs can assist in achieving this goal.</p>

                                within its area of responsibility where the internal security
                                situation represents a threat to significant United States interests
                                and where United States foreign internal defense assistance would be
                                desirable and feasible under the criteria of the revised policy. The
                                list should be supported by a brief explicit statement of the
                                reasons for including each country.</p>
                            <p>Strict application of the revised criteria necessarily will reduce
                                the number of countries worldwide that qualify for United States
                                assistance in the field of internal defense. However, it is
                                recognized that in some countries current programs will have to be
                                continued (although phased down over time) even if not completely
                                justifiable on the grounds of an internal security threat to
                                significant United States interests. Valid reasons for such
                                exceptions may be preservation of a special political or military
                                relationship, supplementing economic development assistance,
                                repayment for United States overseas base rights, or protection of
                                other United States interests. Each <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> will be expected to distinguish clearly between
                                those countries which fully qualify for foreign internal defense
                                assistance under the revised policy, and those which the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> believes should continue to receive
                                such assistance for other reasons, submitting to the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> only the names of those countries

                                country’s inclusion and its priority in the foreign internal defense

                                    <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>. This analysis will include
                                a detailed summary of host country, United States, third country,
                                and international agency programs proposed to meet the internal
                                threat.</p>

                                In either case, internal defense considerations should be carefully
                                related to and integrated with other political, economic, military,
                                psychological, and informational aspects of United States policies
                                and programs, and should focus on improving the capability of the
                                country itself to strengthen its own internal security, using United
                                States programs and resources in supporting roles. The country
                                internal defense plan will be the basis for departmental and
                                interdepartmental decisions on United States policies and programs
                                concerning internal defense. Except as a new crisis may require, the
                                plan should be submitted early enough in the budget cycle so that
                                Washington guidance may be available to the field for use in the

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Within the past year the Soviets appear to have made further reductions in
                        the construction of ballistic missile defenses at Moscow.</p>
                    <p>The early evidence suggested that the Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system would have a force level of 128 launchers at 16
                        launch sites—four sites in each quadrant. In early 1964, construction in the
                        southeast quadrant was abandoned, and the number of launch sites dropped to
                        12. Work has now apparently ceased on two more sites in the northeastern and
                        two in the southwestern environs of Moscow. If construction is not resumed
                        at these sites, the final force level for the completed system will be eight
                        sites and a total complement of 64 launchers.</p>
                    <p>Partial system operational capability is probably near. All elements of the
                        system are expected to be operational by mid-1970.</p>
                    <p>The cutbacks will not materially change the strategic role of the system,
                        since even at originally indicated levels it could not have coped with a
                        determined US attack. The Soviets may now feel a greater need for improved
                        capabilities—for example, against penetration aids and multiple
                        warheads—before filling in the Moscow system or extending <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> coverage into other parts of the Soviet
                        Union. The cutbacks thus could represent a pause while improvements are
                        being sought.</p>
                    <p>If so, the Soviets may now view arms limitations discussions with the US as a
                        way of probing—at no penalty to themselves—the firmness of the United
                        States’ intent to carry out improvements presently programmed for its
                        strategic forces. Although the Soviets have not formally <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0723"/>responded to US initiatives for arms
                        limiting talks, they have carefully kept alive the possibility that they
                        will eventually do so.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, work on elements of the Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        system is progressing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The forward early warning and tracking radars at Olenegorsk and
                                Skrunda are now believed to be operational.</p>
                            <p>At Moscow, three of the present eight launch sites and the
                                northwestern faces of the Dog House target acquisition and tracking
                                radar are probably undergoing checkout for operational readiness
                                later this year.</p>
                            <p>Recent ground clearing and associated activities at Skrunda and
                                Moscow raise the possibility that deployment of new <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>-related radars is under way.</p>
                        </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>Completion of the launch sites still under construction will probably mark
                        the end of deployment of the system in its current form. However, activity
                        at the Sary Shagan missile test center indicates a continuing effort to
                        improve ballistic missile defense systems. A better system, based on present
                        technology and work currently under way at Sary Shagan, could be ready for
                        deployment within a year or two but probably would not be widely deployed
                        and operational much before 1973 or 1974.</p>

                        on a separate basis. The President also understands that actual deployments
                        against these ceilings will be controlled by the Secretary of Defense, and
                        he wishes to be advised as a matter of information of any significant
                        changes in contemplated actual overseas deployments within these ceilings.
                        In addition, the President will consider <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                        1970 in next year’s plan, which will deal with both <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. The
                        President continues to be interested in Pacific Theatre requirements and
                        will expect additional consideration of such requirements to be reflected in
                        the next plan. The President has authorized the Department of Defense in

                    <p>To assess the capabilities of foreign nations to introduce biological,
                        chemical, or nuclear weapons clandestinely into the US, and to estimate the
                        likelihood of such introduction over the next few years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>Virtually any industrial nation could produce biological warfare
                                (<gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss>) and chemical warfare (<gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>) agents and introduce them clandestinely
                            into the US in relatively small quantities. We do not believe, however,
                            that any potential enemy would plan the clandestine use of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> on a
                            scale sufficient to achieve strategic military objectives. We do not
                            rule out the use of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> for sabotage and other special purposes
                            for which they could be very effective. The relatively small quantities
                            required for these purposes could be covertly produced in the US without
                            great difficulty or risk of detection. Therefore we consider that their
                            clandestine introduction would be unnecessary, and unlikely in view of
                            the risks involved.</item>

                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets could introduce nuclear weapons clandestinely into the US,
                            and might consider doing so if they planned a deliberate surprise attack
                            on the US. Considering the large numbers of strategic weapons now in
                            their arsenal, however, the Soviets would see the contribution of a
                            clandestine emplacement effort as marginal and would consider any
                            advantages it offered as outweighed by the risks of jeopardizing
                            surprise and of precipitating a US preemptive attack.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>Because the Chinese have no other means of attacking the US with
                            nuclear weapons, they might consider a clandestine emplacement effort
                            with the object of deterring the US from attack on Communist China.
                            Their capabilities to carry out such an effort, however, are much less
                            than those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Moreover, they
                            could not be sure that the US would be deterred and they would have to
                            consider that detection might result in, rather than stave off, a
                            devastating US strike. For these reasons, we think it unlikely that
                            Communist China will attempt to introduce nuclear weapons clandestinely
                            into the US.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>We have considered the possibility that a third country (e.g., Cuba)
                            might assist the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or China in the
                            clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons into the US. We consider
                            this unlikely. We doubt that either the Soviets or the Chinese would
                            seek to enlist the aid of another nation in such a sensitive
                            undertaking. If they should, that nation’s leaders would almost
                            certainly react unfavorably to a proposal that could jeopardize their
                            national survival merely to support Soviet or Chinese policy.</item>

                        <item>In considering the clandestine introduction of weapons of mass
                            destruction into the US, enemy leaders would have to weigh any possible
                            advantages against the grave consequences which would follow from
                            discovery. Despite all precautions there would always be risk of
                            detection arising not only from specific US security measures, but also
                            from the chance of US penetration of the clandestine apparatus, the
                            defection of an agent, or sheer accident. The enemy leaders would almost
                            certainly judge that use of this tactic would be regarded by the US as a
                            warlike act, if not as a cause for war, and that it would precipitate an
                            international political crisis of the first magnitude.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>We believe, therefore, that the range of circumstances in which
                            weapons of mass destruction might be clandestinely introduced into the
                            US is quite narrow—that an enemy nation would consider this course only
                            in the context of planning an attack on the US or of deterring the US
                            from an attack on itself. Smaller stakes would not be worth the risk.
                            Such weapons could not be brought in secretly in sufficient <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0730"/>quantities to have a decisive effect on
                            the outcome of a war. Any plans for their use, we believe, would
                            envision the use of limited quantities to achieve results unattainable
                            by other means.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Virtually any industrial nation could produce biological warfare
                                (<gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss>) and chemical warfare (<gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss>) agents and introduce them clandestinely
                            into the US in relatively small quantities. Although small quantities of
                                <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> agents could be effective against
                            large targets, the delayed action of such agents makes them unsuitable
                            for use in situations requiring an immediate or precisely timed effect.
                            Relatively large quantities of <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> agents
                            are required to obtain effective concentrations over extensive target
                            areas, and it would be difficult to introduce them clandestinely in such
                            quantities. Moreover, the effects of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> agents cannot always be predicted
                            accurately; adverse weather can limit or even prevent the effective use
                            of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> agents against some targets.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>We do not rule out the use of <gloss target="#t_BW1">BW</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_CW1">CW</gloss> for sabotage and other special
                            purposes for which they could be very effective. But because the
                            relatively small quantities required for these purposes could be
                            covertly produced in the US without great difficulty or risk of
                            detection, we consider that their clandestine introduction would be
                            unnecessary, and therefore unlikely in view of the risks involved. The
                            following discussion, therefore, is limited to a consideration of the
                            clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons.</item>

                        <item>Only four foreign nations—the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, and Communist China—have
                            developed and tested nuclear weapons. Beyond these, only India is likely
                            to undertake a nuclear weapons program in the next several years; Israel
                            and Sweden might do so. We can foresee no changes in the world situation
                            so radical as to motivate the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France,
                            or any of the potential nuclear powers to attempt to clandestinely
                            introduce nuclear weapons into the US. For this reason, the balance of
                            this discussion will be concerned only with the remaining nuclear
                            powers, the Soviet Union and Communist China.</item>

                            difficulties and risks of introducing higher yield or heavier weapons
                            into the US, even in a disassembled state, are probably sufficiently <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0731"/>great to seriously discourage
                            such attempts. But higher yield weapons could be brought into US waters
                            in merchant ships and detonated without removal from the ship. Such
                            devices could also be carried in by fishing boats or similar small craft
                            to which transfer had been made at sea.</item>

                        <item>Both the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist China
                            could make the physical arrangements necessary to bring nuclear weapons
                            secretly into the US, but Soviet capabilities in this respect are much
                            greater than Chinese. We believe that if either country undertook such a
                            program, they would rely on their own agent organizations rather than on
                            political sympathizers in the US. Soviet intelligence services have
                            assigned a high priority to the development of espionage and sabotage
                            capabilities in the US and presumably have formed an organization for
                            the latter purpose. Should the Soviets undertake the clandestine
                            introduction of nuclear weapons, they almost certainly would employ the
                            highly trained and reliable agents of these services. They could also
                            employ diplomatic personnel and could bring in weapons or weapon
                            components under diplomatic cover. The large diplomatic establishments
                            in Canada and Mexico could serve as bases for the operation.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>There are no Chinese Communist diplomatic establishments in the US,
                            Canada, or Mexico. The absence of such bases precludes the use of
                            diplomatic pouches for the clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons
                            or their components and the use of secure diplomatic communications for
                            planning and control of such an operation; it also makes more difficult
                            the introduction and control of agents. Nevertheless, the Chinese could
                            introduce agents under the guise of bona fide immigrants.</item>

                        <item>In considering Soviet and Chinese capabilities, we have also
                            considered the possibility that a third country (e.g., Cuba) might
                            assist the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or China in the
                            clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons into the US. We consider
                            this unlikely on two counts. We doubt that either the Soviets or the
                            Chinese would seek to enlist the aid of another nation in such a
                            sensitive undertaking. And if they should, that nation’s leaders would
                            almost certainly react unfavorably to a proposal that could jeopardize
                            their national survival merely to support Soviet or Chinese
                            policy.</item>

                        <item>If the Soviets or Communist Chinese have considered the clandestine
                            introduction of nuclear weapons into the US, they have almost certainly
                            been influenced by the same general considerations: the element of risk,
                            the opportunities for clandestine introduction, and the results that
                            could be achieved. The two countries, however, occupy <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0732"/>vastly different strategic positions
                            vis-à-vis the US. Thus, while we believe that neither would consider the
                            use of this tactic except in the context of a possible general war,
                            differing strategic considerations might lead the Soviets and the
                            Chinese to see the clandestine introduction of nuclear weapons in a
                            somewhat different light.</item>

                            </hi>. The Soviet leaders, like those of the US, must take account of
                            the possibility of general war in their military planning. In such
                            planning, the Soviets would consider the clandestine introduction of
                            nuclear weapons into the US, if at all, only as a supplement to the main
                            attack by their large strategic attack forces. Because they have already
                            achieved an assured retaliatory capability, they would probably consider
                            a clandestine emplacement effort as potentially useful only in support
                            of a deliberate or preemptive Soviet attack and directed toward delaying
                            or reducing a US retaliatory attack. Possible targets might include
                            important government headquarters, key military command and control
                            facilities, missile detection and tracking radars, and possibly some
                            manned alert forces. The Soviets would recognize, however, that even if
                            such an effort were successful, it could not prevent US retaliation or
                            reduce it to an acceptable level.</item>
                        <label>13.</label>
                        <item>In considering clandestine attack as a supplement to other weapons,
                            the Soviets would have to weigh their ability to initiate such attack
                            rapidly, with little preparation, and in close coordination with the
                            main weight of attack. Thus, clandestinely introduced weapons would have
                            to be in position at the time the attacks were launched. In the case of
                            a preemptive attack, the circumstances would not allow sufficient time
                            for the introduction and delivery of such weapons after a decision to
                            preempt. To prepare for this contingency beforehand, the Soviets would
                            have to accept the risk of maintaining weapons in the US for an
                            indefinite period of time. These difficulties would not obtain if the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> decided deliberately to
                            initiate general war in a period of low tension; weapons could be
                            introduced into the US a relatively short time before use. But the
                            Soviets would have to consider the risk of jeopardizing the element of
                            surprise on which this course of action relies, and that discovery might
                            precipitate a US preemptive attack which would be disastrous for the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. For these reasons, we think
                            it unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will attempt
                            to introduce nuclear weapons clandestinely into the US.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Communist China</hi>. The Chinese have no capability
                            at present to attack the US with nuclear weapons. They probably have an
                                <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system in the early stages of
                            development, which could become operational several years from now. But
                            they may fear that when it does the US antiballistic missile deployment
                            will have rendered it largely ineffective. In these circumstances, they
                            might see some advantages in clandestinely introducing and emplacing
                            nuclear weapons in the US. <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0733"/>Inasmuch as they could not deliver such an attack on a scale
                            sufficient to achieve a decisive military objective, their object would
                            presumably be to deter the US from a course of action that gravely
                            threatened their national security. Consequently, the most likely
                            targets would be population centers.</item>
                        <label>15.</label>
                        <item>Clearly, the Chinese would also see grave disadvantages in such a
                            move. So long as the US was unaware of their existence, the concealed
                            weapons would have no effect upon its actions. Indeed, the risk of their
                            discovery would be an ever-present, continuing danger to the Chinese
                            themselves. Once the Chinese announced that nuclear weapons were
                            emplaced in the US, the announcement would touch off an intensive search
                            and extraordinary security measures. Moreover, the Chinese could not be
                            sure that the US would in fact be deterred. On the one hand, the US
                            might consider such an unverified announcement as a mere bluff. On the
                            other it might take the clandestine introduction of such weapons as a
                            casus belli and, having taken such action as it could to safeguard its
                            population, launch a devastating nuclear attack on China. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] It is
                            conceivable that some Chinese regime might be willing to accept such
                            risks of national destruction, but we think it unlikely.</item>

                            <item>Against the expected Soviet threat, our present strategic
                                offensive forces provide a more than adequate Assured Destruction

                            <item>The program that we are recommending not only assures that we
                                maintain our Assured Destruction capability, but provides timely and
                                efficient options to meet the designed Greater-Than-Expected (<gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss>) Soviet threat to our deterrent

                                against the Soviet Union does not appear to be feasible with current
                                technology and in relation to its cost and the other demands on our
                                resources.</item>

                            <item>We will continue to maintain strategic “nuclear superiority” over
                                the Soviets in terms of nuclear warheads. Based on our own
                                experience, however, we doubt that this superiority can be converted
                                into meaningful political power, particularly now that the Soviet
                                Union also has a large and well-protected Assured Destruction
                                capability.</item>

                            <item>We cannot depend on our nuclear forces alone to fulfill our
                                nation’s commitments and insure our national security; we must also
                                maintain very strong nonnuclear forces.</item>

                            <item>Based on our view of U.S. security needs, and without considering
                                the implications of possible arms control agreements that might

                    <p rend="center">I. The General Nuclear War Problem</p>
                    <p>The main objective of our nuclear forces is to deter nuclear attacks on the
                        United States. Our ability to strike back and destroy Soviet society makes a
                        Soviet decision to strike the United States highly unlikely. By developing
                        and deploying forces that are difficult to attack we can reduce even more
                        the likelihood of such an attack. Unable to destroy most of our nuclear
                        striking power, the Soviets would gain little by striking first.</p>
                    <p>Although the United States and the Soviet Union are strongly deterred from
                        nuclear attacks on each other, a nuclear war anywhere in the world could
                        lead to a war—and most likely a nuclear war—between the two countries. To
                        avoid a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, we try to make all nuclear wars
                        unlikely. This objective includes: <list>

                    </p>
                    <p>To deter a first-strike nuclear attack, both we and the Soviets maintain the
                        ability to strike back and destroy the other’s society. When they take steps
                        to reduce the damage that we can inflict—for example, by deploying
                        Anti-Ballistic Missiles (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>s)—we react to
                        offset these steps. The Soviets would undoubtedly react in the same way to
                        similar U.S. steps to limit significantly damage to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Our analysis shows that the Soviets can protect their second strike
                        capability against any threat we might pose. Since a second strike
                        capability is vital to the Soviets, they will insure the survival of this
                        capability. Convinced that the Soviets would counter a major U.S. attempt to
                        take away their second strike capability, we see no effective way to
                        implement, with present technology and within available resources, a major
                        Damage Limiting program against them, although we are continuing development
                        work that might eventually support such a program.</p>
                    <p>These considerations lead us to put primary reliance upon deterrence to keep
                        the Soviet Union from attacking us. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                            source text not declassified</hi>] on the other hand, we can buy an
                        effective defense of <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> as insurance
                        against a failure of deterrence. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                        defense against her nuclear attack capability into the 1980s.</p>
                    <p>What if deterrence fails and a nuclear war with the Soviet Union occurs? If
                        the war began with an all-out Soviet attack, including our <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0738"/>cities, we would reply in kind. If the war
                        started with less than an all-out attack, we would want to carry out plans
                        for the controlled and deliberate use of our nuclear power to achieve the
                        best possible outcome. The lack of such nuclear war plans is still a
                        continuing weakness in our present posture.</p>

                    <p>A new solid-fueled Soviet missile has been identified. Present intelligence
                        estimates assume it is an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, which will
                        come into the Soviet inventory as a supplement to (rather than as a
                        replacement for) the SS–11.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have continued to test Fractional Orbit Ballistic Systems (<gloss target="#t_FOBS1">FOBS</gloss>). If we took no counter actions, these
                        systems would be useful in an attempt to deny timely warning to our
                        strategic bombers.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is now making operational a new class of large,
                        nuclear-powered, ballistic missile submarines which carry 16 missiles with a
                        range of about 1,000 nautical miles (NM). Intelligence estimates project
                        that 10 to 13 of these boats will be in service by mid-1971, and 35 to 42 by
                        1976.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are also engaged in a continuing effort to improve their
                        strategic defenses. They have modified and improved the capabilities of the
                        SA–2 air defense missile system; they are developing and producing a series
                        of new interceptor aircraft; they are deploying the SA–5 air defense missile
                        system; and they are in the advanced stages of constructing a ballistic
                        missile defense system around Moscow. The intelligence community estimates
                        that the Soviets have a formidable capability against medium to
                        high-altitude air threats, a limited capability against low-altitude air
                        threats, and probably little or no capability against ballistic
                        missiles.</p>

                    <p>The SA–5 system is being deployed in all important areas of the Soviet Union.
                        It has two to five firing sites per complex. Each site has six launchers
                            [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In
                        addition, the system may have some capability against ballistic missiles,
                        although this now appears unlikely.</p>
                    <p>The ballistic missile defense system around Moscow with about 100 launchers
                        may be fully operational by 1971. It is believed to be a long range,
                        exoatmospheric system using large yield warheads.</p>
                    <p>We still have seen no evidence of Soviet development of a good low-altitude
                        Surface-to-Air Missile (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>). However, the
                        new Foxbat interceptor is now estimated to have a “look-down, shoot-down”
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese were expected to begin operational deployment of a Medium Range
                        Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>) with a fission
                        warhead in 1967, but they did not do so. China also has under development a
                        much larger and more complex missile system, possibly an <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. They were expected to complete a
                        facility for large launchers late in 1967, but they did not. It appears that
                        they are at least nine months behind the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> schedule that we previously estimated. However, this delay
                        would still allow an initial operational <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment as early as 1972.</p>

                    <p>We deter a rational enemy from launching a first strike against us by
                        maintaining a strong and secure ability to retaliate under any

                        extremely conservative assumptions, on the attacker, even after a surprise
                        attack. Our ability to [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2 lines of source text not

                    <p>However, our Assured Destruction capability does not indicate how we would
                        use our forces in a nuclear war. We must design our forces to cope with many
                        situations, including a war which neither side intended. We reduce the
                        likelihood of such a war by keeping tight control over U.S. forces under all
                        circumstances; by maintaining communications at all times with our forces,
                        the governments of our allies, and, as appropriate, our enemies; and by
                        having the options to choose an appropriate response. If we failed to deter
                        nuclear war, we would want to be able to follow a policy of limiting our
                        retaliatory strikes to the enemy’s military targets and not attacking his
                        cities if he refrained from attacking ours. In most situations we would have
                        many missiles surviving to attack Soviet military targets, while withholding
                        enough for [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        worthwhile.</p>

                    <p>In measuring the capability of our forces, we cannot simply count total
                        megatons or delivery systems, we must measure the amount of damage each side
                        could do to the cities, population, industry, and military forces of the
                        other. Factors such as accuracy, reliability, survivability, defense
                        penetrability, and control are often much more important than warhead size
                        in determining damage levels. The relative importance of these factors
                        depends heavily on the attack objectives and the characteristics of the
                        target system attacked. And, of course, the relative costs of additional
                        weapons, yield (megatonnage), accuracy, survivability, reliability, and
                        penetrability also affect how much of each of these factors should be bought
                        to achieve any particular level of destructive capacity.</p>
                    <p>The next table illustrates the relative effectiveness of equal payloads of
                        alternate warheads used against Soviet targets. It compares [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>

                    <p>As the table shows, comparisons of missile launchers or megatons are not very
                        meaningful. If a single input must be used as a measure, however, the best
                        indicator of the relative capabilities of our forces is the number of
                        weapons they can deliver. While the Soviet forces may exceed ours in
                        megatons by 1972, the Soviets still cannot take away our Assured Destruction
                        capability, largely because we will maintain a commanding lead in the number
                        of weapons available and because our forces are relatively invulnerable to a
                        Soviet first strike.</p>

                    <p>The vital importance of our Assured Destruction capability to our national
                        security requires us to be prepared to cope with Soviet strategic threats
                        greater than those which the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> projects.
                        While unlikely, the Soviets might add a very extensive <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense or much improved anti-bomber
                        defenses. They might improve their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force by putting accurate Multiple Independently-targetable Re-entry
                        Vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s) on the SS–9, or by
                        replacing or improving the SS–11 with a new, more accurate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Conceivably, they might take all these
                        actions. In order to test the adequacy of our forces under the worst
                        conceivable conditions, we have designed what we call a
                        “Greater-Than-Expected” threat. This threat includes all of the above
                        offensive and defensive actions plus others which the Soviets might
                        undertake in an effort to take away our Assured Destruction capability. The

                    <p>Soviet programs required to support such an effort would be technically
                        difficult, expensive, and, since we have clearly indicated we would respond,
                        hold little hope of providing the Soviets with a net gain in effective first
                        strike capability. Nevertheless, to insure that these threats remain
                        unlikely, and to maintain our deterrent should they appear, we make sure
                        that we have the options needed to counter them. The Soviet Union, by
                        replacing or improving the accuracy of its SS–11s and adding accurate <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s to its SS–9s, could destroy Minuteman
                        missiles in their silos. Even if the Soviets could destroy all Minuteman
                        missiles, however, they would not eliminate our Assured Destruction
                        capability. Our remaining Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (<gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s) and alert bomber force can penetrate
                        the <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>-estimated Soviet defenses and kill

                        greater-than-expected offensive threat through 1977.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, at least through 1976, a very extensive Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system and air defense, without
                        greater-than-expected <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, would still
                        let the U.S. programmed force maintain an Assured Destruction capability of

                        because we already have programmed <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        hedges—Poseidon plus <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and penetration
                        aids for Minuteman.</p>
                    <p>By putting [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] Mk-3s on each
                        Poseidon missile and increasing the bomber alert rate, the U.S. programmed
                        force can keep its Assured Destruction capability through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77, even if the <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0743"/>Soviets deploy greater-than-expected, balanced missile and
                        bomber defenses (without improving their offensive forces). We do not have
                        to exercise these options now to meet this threat.</p>
                    <p>Only against a combined greater-than-expected Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>, air defense, and accurate <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, costing the Soviets $20 to $30 billion above the

                        to our retaliatory forces. The following table shows the effect of the

                        Assured Destruction capability. It indicates the U.S. programmed force
                        capability and the effects of developing and deploying Poseidon decoys,
                        increasing the bomber alert rate to 60%, and buying advanced bomber
                        penetration aids. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-recommended

                    <p>As the table shows, while the combined <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss>
                        threat would call for a more effective U.S. Assured Destruction capability
                        for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74, we can maintain our Assured
                        Destruction against this threat without buying any new missiles or bombers.
                        We can do this by using technological advances that greatly increase the
                        penetration capability of our Poseidon and bomber payloads.</p>
                    <p>We have, however, three main reasons for wanting additional options to
                        maintain our Assured Destruction capability against the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat. First, we do not want to rely
                        primarily on alert bombers which depend on tactical warning for survival.
                        Second, depending on how far <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> technology
                        advances, we may not want to depend on decoys for missile penetration.
                        Third, unless we protect our land-based missile force, the
                        greater-than-expected Soviet offense could destroy it in its silos. In such
                        a case, we should either protect Minuteman or phase it out, since a
                        vulnerable missile force encourages—rather than deters—a first strike. We do
                        not need to buy protection for our land-based missiles until we see the
                        threat, since we can rely on bombers and Poseidon in the interim.</p>
                    <p>As discussed below, we propose to develop and maintain a number of options to
                        allow us to keep our Assured Destruction capability against the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat, even though this threat is not
                        likely to appear. Since the threat is unlikely, we should select options
                        with small initial costs. If later evidence does not rule out the threat, we
                        can then develop these options fully. Because of uncertainties about the
                        performance and cost of new systems, it is usually unwise to deploy them as
                        replacements for proven, existing systems until a threat appears which
                        cannot be economically met by improving the existing systems. <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0744"/>Once an option has been developed, however,
                        we examine it to see if it would be an economical replacement for part of
                        the programmed force. In some cases, advances in technology permit us to
                        save money by replacing an existing system with a new one, even though the
                        new system does not provide more total effectiveness than the one it
                        replaces.</p>

                            <p>We could develop terminal decoys for Poseidon. These decoys would aid
                                in penetrating large <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses if
                                the threat to our land-based missile forces became severe. By

                                could equip all Poseidon with decoys by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75. The development costs would be $200 million in
                                    <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70–73 and the procurement

                                73–74.</p>

                            <p>If Soviet air defenses improved, but their <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability did not, no increase in the size or
                                expense of our strategic forces would be necessary. However, if the
                                Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> threat became greater
                                than the highest <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>, we might wish
                                to respond by increasing the capability of our bomber force.
                                Increasing the alert rate to 60% would cost about $190 million per
                                year. By doing this, buying the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-recommended inventories of <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SCAD1">SCAD</gloss>, and
                                putting penetration aids on Poseidon, we could maintain our Assured
                                Destruction capability, as shown above.</p>
                            <p>Although we would not want to rely only on the bomber force, the next
                                table shows the Assured Destruction capability of an improved bomber
                                force used alone against the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss>
                                threat. Against balanced terminal and area defenses, we could add a
                                mixture of <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>s, which are better
                                against terminal defenses, and <gloss target="#t_SCAD1">SCAD</gloss>s, which are better against area defenses. The <gloss target="#t_SCAD1">SCAD</gloss>s could act as bomber decoys,
                                carry nuclear warheads, or both. Contract Definition in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 would lead to an Initial

                                    <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74. The 10-year systems cost
                                of the improved bomber force considered below would be $2.1 to $2.6
                                billion more than that of the presently programmed force, excluding

                            <p>As the table shows, by buying and arming more <gloss target="#t_SCAD1">SCAD</gloss>s than recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, we could maintain a substantial
                                bombers-only Assured Destruction capability against the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77 simply by improving the programmed
                                force. Thus, an Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (<gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>) is not needed. We would deploy
                                    <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> only if an <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> force of equal effectiveness
                                costs less than the improved programmed force. Such a force would
                                require about 138 <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>s and would
                                cost $4.9 billion more than the improved programmed force in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 69–78. Thus, we do not need to
                                maintain an option to deploy <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss>
                                by <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77.</p>
                            <p>Considerations other than cost also make an <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> force less attractive than improving the
                                programmed force. First, developing <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> requires a longer lead-time than deploying <gloss target="#t_SRAM1">SRAM</gloss>s and cruise missiles on the
                                programmed force and thus imposes a substantial initial investment
                                before we could determine that an increased Soviet threat has
                                developed. Second, if we decide to proceed with <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> now and the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat does not appear, we will
                                have spent $3 to $10 billion unnecessarily. Third, we do not yet
                                know whether <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> should be
                                designed primarily as a penetrating aircraft or primarily to carry
                                stand-off cruise missiles, nor do we know the value of supersonic
                                speed and advanced avionics. Starting <gloss target="#t_AMSA1">AMSA</gloss> now, before we have resolved these issues, could
                                force us to make costly changes later.</p>

                            <p>A defense of the programmed Minuteman force could use the same
                                components being developed for the Sentinel system: Sprint, Spartan,
                                Perimeter Acquisition Radar (<gloss target="#t_PAR1">PAR</gloss>),
                                and Missile Site Radar (<gloss target="#t_MSR1">MSR</gloss>). An
                                option for a light defense of Minuteman is being maintained in the
                                current Sentinel deployment plan. This light defense, although not
                                increasing the number of Minuteman surviving a heavy Soviet attack,
                                might show our determination to protect Minuteman and indicate that
                                we would expand the defense if the threat grew larger. In a less
                                than all-out attack on Minuteman (about 1,200 reliable, accurate
                                re-entry vehicles), the light defense could save about 300 Minuteman
                                missiles. The median defense would be an expansion of the light
                                defense to defend more Minuteman and could be supplemented with
                                additional Minuteman III in hard rock silos. The <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense and hard rock silos would
                                insure enough Minuteman surviving against large <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s on the SS–9 to maintain,
                                together with our other forces, our Assured Destruction capability.
                                The heavy defense of Minuteman would maintain our Assured
                                Destruction capability even against a Soviet small-<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> threat. The table on the next

                    <p>We have many options to meet the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat
                        that do not require a major effort now. Adding five Poseidon boats and
                        terminal decoys on all Poseidon is clearly the least expensive option. If we
                        start a decoy development program now, the development time for the decoys
                        would be about two and one-half years, and it would take another one and
                        one-half years to deploy them on the programmed Poseidon force. We could
                        then make a decision next year on adding more submarines and still meet the
                            <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss> threat.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets might deploy an improved <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                        force, alone or as part of a combined <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss>
                        threat, capable of destroying Minuteman. In some situations, a vulnerable
                        Minuteman force might invite rather than deter an attack. In this case we
                        could phase out Minuteman and rely on Poseidon for our Assured Destruction
                        capability. However, it is desirable to maintain some land-based missiles as
                        a hedge against unexpected threats to the Poseidon force, such as Soviet
                        advances in Anti-Submarine Warfare (<gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>)
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>To protect the land-based missile force, we can defend Minuteman with an
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system at less cost than we can add
                        hard rock silos for Minuteman. None of the new <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s has a clear cost advantage over defending Minuteman with
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system or putting Minuteman in hard
                        rock silos until we need a much larger surviving payload to penetrate a
                        Soviet <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system that is much stronger than
                        the one we envision as part of the <gloss target="#t_GTE1">GTE</gloss>
                        threat.</p>
                    <p>Not only is it cheaper to protect our land-based missile force with an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system alone (compared to a mix of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense and hard rock silos), but it is
                        much cheaper in the early years. However, we would not want to rely only on
                        an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system. We are uncertain about the
                        effectiveness of a heavy <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense against
                        a heavy attack and the sensitivity of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                        defense to larger numbers of smaller yield <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and penetration aids. We would need lower levels of
                            <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense and smaller numbers of hard
                        rock silos if we deployed a combination of these two to hedge against a
                        greater variation in threat. This suggests the following decision strategy:
                        (1) maintain an option to proceed with an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense of Minuteman (decision in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 69, initial funding in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71)
                        which could be expanded as the threat increased; (2) if the threat becomes
                        more severe, stop expanding the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defense
                        and plan on deploying 100 Minuteman IIIs in hard rock silos in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 77; and (3) reduce near term costs for hard
                        rock silo development to fit this schedule and to allow more time to find
                        out how hard the silos actually prove to be.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Our ability to strike back and destroy Soviet society, even under conditions
                        and assumptions favorable to the Soviets, makes any kind of <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0749"/>nuclear war with the Soviets unlikely.
                        Thus, we first buy forces to give us high confidence in our deterrent. As
                        insurance in the unlikely event deterrence fails, we then consider adding
                        forces that might reduce damage to our population and industry. Since we
                        have offensive forces available for attacking military targets, the basic
                        Damage Limiting issue is whether we should deploy Nike-X in defense of our
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>A defensive system to save U.S. cities from a Soviet nuclear attack must
                        attempt to keep ahead of the Soviet threat, including their reactions to our
                        deployment. Such attempts are costly. In our analyses we use two stages in
                        such a deployment.<note n="2" xml:id="d210fn2">Because the language in the

                            first strike in the mid-1970s. See <hi rend="italic">Authorization for

                            significantly the ability of the Soviets to kill Americans. Our attempt
                            to limit damage if our deterrent fails also operates to take away the
                            Soviet deterrent. The following table shows what happens if the defense
                            works and the Soviets do not react.</note> The first, “Posture A,” is an
                        initial step recommended by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. It
                        represents an area defense of <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> and a
                        light defense of 25 cities. It would cost about $12 billion in investment
                        and $900 million a year to operate. The second, “Posture B,” is an attempt
                        to keep ahead of the threat. It includes a higher density local defense of
                        52 cities. It would cost about $20 billion in investment and over $1.2
                        billion a year to operate. For Posture B we would also need improved air and
                        civil defenses and <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss> forces at an
                        additional cost of $4 to $5 billion in investment. We believe the pursuit of
                        effective defenses would eventually cost much more. Our commitment would be

                    <p>As the table shows, the Soviets lose their deterrent if they do not respond.
                        They would be forced to react to increase their ability to strike back. The
                        Soviets have the technological and economic capability to respond in many
                        ways by: (1) adding <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s and penetration
                        aids to their projected missile inventories; (2) adding a mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, the SS–Z–2; (3) adding a new, higher
                        payload, mobile missile; (4) deploying additional <gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s; (5) defending all or a portion of their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force; (6) launching all or a portion of
                        their <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force on warning; (7) adding
                        more bombers; or (8) some combinations of these responses. Against Posture
                        A, the Soviets must respond with at least 100 new mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s or an equivalent force in order to
                        maintain their Assured Destruction capability; against Posture B, they must
                        respond with at least 500 new mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s
                        or an equivalent force. These responses, while restoring their Assured
                        Destruction capability, also restore their ability to kill Americans in a
                        first strike. The table below shows what happens if the Soviets do
                        respond.</p>

                    <p>As part of their response, the Soviets could add large numbers of offensive
                        missiles, which would threaten our Assured Destruction capability. We, in
                        turn, would have to react. Viewing each other’s buildup in forces as an
                        increased threat, each side would take counteracting steps, generating a
                        costly arms race with no net gain in security for either side.</p>
                    <p>The above tables also show an important and paradoxical result regarding
                        first strikes. The number of U.S. killed when the Soviet Union strikes first
                        is less than or equal to the number of U.S. killed when the United States
                        strikes first. The main reason for this is that there are two opposing
                        effects in a strategic nuclear exchange. On the one hand, the country that
                        strikes first can destroy a large number of the other’s bombers and missiles
                        on the ground, thereby limiting retaliatory damage to itself. On the other
                        hand, the country that strikes second, facing an enemy that has partially
                        disarmed himself, is likely to concentrate on attacking cities with its
                        surviving force because there is little to be gained by firing back at empty
                        missile silos and air bases. In the past, when neither side had a
                        significant second strike force, the country that struck first could expect
                        to achieve some strategic advantage. Now, however, the United States and the
                        Soviet Union have reached a point where both have a large, hard-to-attack
                        second strike force. Therefore, the country that now strikes first may
                        destroy some of the other’s weapons, but by freeing all of the enemy’s
                        remaining weapons to strike its own cities, it more than compensates for the
                        enemy weapons it destroys and loses more than it gains. This result
                        strengthens our belief that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union
                        stands to benefit by striking first.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>There has been evidence that the Chinese are devoting very substantial
                        resources to the development of both nuclear warheads and missile delivery
                        systems. Within a period of less than three years, they successfully
                        detonated six nuclear devices. Last December, they detonated a seventh
                        device, but this test was apparently a partial failure. These seven nuclear
                        tests, together with their continuing work on surface-to-surface missiles,
                        lead us to believe that they are moving ahead with the development of an
                            <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>. Indeed, if their program proceeds
                        at its present pace (although there is some evidence it has been delayed)
                        they could have a modest force of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s by
                        the mid-1970s.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for deploying an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system
                        against the Chinese are: (1) it would prevent damage to the United States in
                        a Chinese first strike; (2) it could increase the credibility of our
                        commitments to defend Asian countries against Chinese nuclear intimidation
                        or nuclear attack; and (3) it could lessen China’s ability to drag the
                        United States and the Soviet Union into a nuclear war. In addition, a
                        defense against a light and unsophisticated <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0752"/>Chinese threat would not deprive the Soviet Union of its
                        Assured Destruction capability.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we already have a massive deterrent against a Chinese
                        attack. A Chinese-oriented <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system might
                        enhance the prestige of the Chinese nuclear program and reduce confidence in
                        the ability of our offensive forces to deter attacks on our allies. Further,
                        it might suggest that we think the Chinese would act irrationally when many
                        believe they would not. Leaving Asia and our Asian bases exposed, this
                        system might suggest that the United States is retreating from Asia to a
                        “Fortress America.” Finally, it might keep Asian countries from adhering to
                        a non-proliferation treaty by drawing attention to the threat and causing
                        them to raise demands for their own defense, possibly as a step toward
                        developing their own offensive nuclear capability.</p>
                    <p>On balance, however, we believe the advantages of a Chinese-oriented <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system outweigh the disadvantages. Thus,
                        deployment of the Sentinel system was initiated in September 1967.</p>
                    <p>We do not have to depend on deterrence alone to keep the Chinese from
                        attacking us. The Sentinel system can be deployed at an investment cost of
                        about $5 to $6 billion and should be highly effective against the kind of
                        threat the Chinese may pose in the 1970s. The effectiveness of this
                        deployment in reducing U.S. deaths from a Chinese attack in the 1970s is
                        shown below.</p>

                            <p>We should deploy Sentinel, an effective defense of our cities against
                                an unsophisticated Chinese <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                                attack. The nature of this decision makes the program sensitive to
                                threat and cost. Since the Chinese appear to be behind in the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> development schedule by as much
                                as one year over what we predicted last year, we can somewhat delay

                                by about $1 billion since the deployment decision was made. This has

                    </p>
                    <p>Our current air defenses are costly to operate and relatively ineffective.
                        Without a strong and effective missile defense, even a very effective air
                        defense cannot save many lives. The Soviets could simply target cities with
                        their missiles. In the 1970s the Soviets could kill 110 million Americans if
                        we had no air defense system and 100 million if we had a perfect one.</p>
                    <p>However, there are other objectives of Continental Air Defense which must
                        also be considered. These include: (1) defense against countries other than
                        the Soviet Union, (2) defense against bomber attacks on those strategic
                        forces that we withhold in a controlled nuclear war, (3) peacetime
                        patrolling of our air space, (4) discouraging Soviet bomber aspirations, and
                        (5) the use of continental air defense forces in missions outside the United
                        States. We can achieve these objectives with a modern, more effective air
                        defense force that costs less over the next 14 years than our present force.
                        This modern force will consist of 200 improved F–106 fighters (the F–106X),
                        42 <gloss target="#t_UE1">UE</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> aircraft, and two <gloss target="#t_OTH1">OTH</gloss> radars. It will use the Federal Aviation
                        Agency National Air Space system for back-up command and control. The cost
                        through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 78 for the modern force is $12.3
                        billion compared with $11.7 billion for the current force. However, the
                        lower operating costs of the modern force will result in substantial savings
                        over the present force after <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 79.</p>

                    <p>Adding a small number of F–12s kills more bombers, but at an additional cost
                        of $1 to $4 billion over 10 years. Furthermore, the total number of lives
                        lost in a nuclear war is nearly the same with any of these alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Surveillance is presently the weakest part of our air defense system.
                        Therefore, we should proceed with Engineering Development of <gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> (if the Overland Radar Technology
                        program is successful) and with development of back-scatter <gloss target="#t_OTH1">OTH</gloss> radars. We should also develop, and deploy
                        on the F–106, advanced air-to-air missiles and an advanced fire control
                        system. With these improvements to the F–106, there is little to be gained
                        from the high performance characteristics of the F–12. Thus, we can avoid
                        the additional $1.1 to $1.4 billion cost of an F–12 force and still meet our

                    <p>The same arguments about Damage Limiting also apply to our <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> programs. The Soviets could target <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>-defended cities with missiles and use their

                        defenses. Our other air defense objectives can be met with area air defense.
                        In line with the perimeter defense concept in the F–106X/<gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss> modernization plan, we can phase out 12

                    <p>In the course of the Board’s continuing appraisal of the adequacy of our
                        Government’s intelligence coverage of Soviet plans and actions affecting
                        U.S. national security, we have had discussions of the desirability of
                        reinstituting a periodic examination of the relative strategic strength of
                        the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We have
                        noted that the Net Evaluation Subcommittee of the National Security Council
                        which had been charged with this work was inactivated in 1963 and that no
                        other agency in the government has been given the responsibility for
                        continuing an interdepartmental analysis of this matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">Regarding the termination of the Net Evaluation
                            Subcommittee, see <ref target="#d72">Documents 72</ref> and <ref target="#d82">82</ref>.</note> Meanwhile, from the intelligence
                        point of view, we see the increasing need for reliable information on the
                        status of Soviet advanced strategic military capabilities, and on related
                        Soviet research and development efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0759"/>
                    <p>Based on discussions with former members of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee,
                        our conclusion is that the former evaluation procedure would hardly be
                        adequate to cope with the current problem which is now far more complex than
                        the one which confronted us in the past. These complexities arise from the
                        growing sophistication of strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems,
                        the many unknown factors with regard to the performance of these new weapons
                        and the sensitivity of the kind of study which we have in mind.</p>
                    <p>The kind of analysis we envision would call for an evaluation of the
                        composition, reliability, effectiveness and vulnerability of the strategic
                        offensive and defensive forces of both sides, to include their command and
                        control systems. It would also call for a close study of the
                        urban-industrial structure of both nations in order to assess the probable
                        effects of strategic attacks on urban-industrial targets. These analyses
                        should be based upon the best available information and foreign
                        intelligence. A by-product of the kind of new study we are discussing would
                        be to focus attention on the gaps in the intelligence data and to accelerate
                        measures to collect the missing pieces.</p>
                    <p>After the development of the best possible understanding of the likely
                        performance of the opposing strategic forces, it should then be possible to
                        construct one or more scenarios for war game purposes in order to measure
                        the interactions of these forces in nuclear war. The results would then
                        permit our best military and scientific minds to draw pertinent conclusions
                        as to the relative strength of our forces and the considerations which
                        should influence future decisions and actions in the strategic field.</p>
                    <p>The agencies interested in such a study and with a contribution to make to it
                        include the White House, State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, Justice and <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. Since the study would draw heavily upon
                        the scientific community, the President’s Science Advisory Committee should
                        be included as a participant.</p>
                    <p>Taking into account this breadth of governmental interest, the question
                        arises as to the best way of organizing it. The old Net Evaluation Group did
                        not have adequate scientific support to carry on a study of the scope which
                        we are proposing. Furthermore, it reported through a committee chaired by
                        the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff to the National Security Council. Under
                        present conditions, the Board believes that the proposed study could best be
                        done under the Secretary of Defense acting as executive agent for the
                        President.</p>

                            the conclusion that, rather than improving our military capabilities, we

                            posture. The Soviet technical ability and national purpose are
                            demonstrated by their capability to develop and deploy a ballistic
                            missile defense, a new nuclear submarine with ballistic missiles, and
                            the new Foxbat interceptor, while continuing to expand their hardened

                            system. The development of these Soviet capabilities without
                            corresponding improvements in US strategic force capabilities continues
                            the shift of the strategic balance away from the United States.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The implications of the rationale
                            and the tentative recommendations in the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> are that the United States has neither the capacity nor
                            intent to acquire the strategic force capabilities, to include damage
                            limiting, required to pursue effectively a complete military strategy.
                            While the principal military objective of the United States with regard
                            to strategic nuclear warfare is to deter an attack upon the United
                            States, our deterrent could fail for a number of reasons. Important
                            among these are miscalculation of intent or resolve, underestimation of
                            military capabilities, or commission of an irrational act. Should
                            deterrence fail, the principal objective is to terminate hostilities
                            under conditions of relative advantage while limiting damage to the
                            United States and minimizing damage to US and allied interests. This
                            latter objective is considered to be as important as deterring nuclear
                            war since, if deterrence fails, we must ensure the continued existence
                            of the nation by safeguarding the survival of our essential political,
                            military, and economic structure.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff are
                            concerned about the views in the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>
                            relative to the general approach to deterring strategic nuclear war and
                            the relationship of damage-limiting capability to deterrence. While they
                            concur that deterrence of a rational enemy is dependent on our
                            maintaining a strong and secure ability to retaliate under any
                            circumstances, they also believe that a Soviet decision to initiate
                            hostilities will be influenced not only by their own expected losses but
                            also by US losses and the relative surviving military capabilities. It
                            is difficult to quantify the level of fatalities that will deter the
                            Soviets. The Soviets may not consider their fatalities as the only
                            influencing factor or think of them in terms of a quantitative
                            threshold. If they sustain 20 percent fatalities as compared to 80
                            percent for the United States, for example, they might not be deterred
                            from initiating an attack against the United States. Our judgments of
                            what may deter the Soviets must not be based on calculations limited to
                            a narrow set of hypotheses or which are too far removed from the most
                            likely pattern of admittedly unlikely wars. Further, such judgments
                            should include evaluations of possible Soviet attacks utilizing improved
                            tactics and force capabilities, including pindown, the fractional orbit
                            bombardment system, cruise missile submarines, and medium
                            bombers.</item>

                            of degree within an acceptable level of risk but rather whether or not
                            the United States will possess the strategic capability necessary to

                            not, if the present trend continues, possess the strategic capability to
                            support effectively its national policy in the mid-range period.</item>

                        <item>(<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The existence of US strategic
                            superiority for the past two decades has deterred a global war and
                            permitted flexibility in international affairs. As the relative
                            strategic position of the United States is challenged—and the increasing
                            Soviet capabilities most certainly reflect a challenge—two principal
                            dangers are identifiable: first, that an increasing confidence in their
                            strength will lead the Soviets to high-risk courses, and, second, the
                            possibility that such courses will escalate into strategic nuclear war.
                            Unless the presently programmed strategic force levels of the United
                            States are improved, erosion of our relative strategic position will
                            continue. Concomitantly, flexibility in pursuit of national goals will
                            be constrained by our inability to deal from a position of strength. As
                            this erosion continues, the margin for error in the conduct of
                            international affairs will be reduced, and the risks attendant to each
                            decision will increase at an accelerated rate. The alternative to
                            acceptance of the risks associated with the erosion of our strategic
                            position is to insure that the Soviets have no doubt of the US
                            determination and capability to deter a deliberate enemy decision to
                            attack and, should such deterrence fail, to insure that the United
                            States and its allies emerge with relative advantage irrespective of the
                            circumstances of initiation, response, and termination. To accomplish
                            this, we must continue a vigorous program of research and development;
                            increase survivable missile throw weight; deploy an effective ballistic
                            missile defense against the Soviet threat; continue modernization of
                            forces, including development of a replacement strategic bomber
                            aircraft; and continue to improve strategic command, communications, and
                            warning systems.</item>

                            during the mid-range time period. Accordingly, they believe that,
                            despite the financial constraints anticipated in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970, we should proceed with strategic offensive and
                            defensive programs necessary to maintain and improve our strategic
                            posture in pace with the threat and within an acceptable margin of risk.
                            Therefore, they recommend that the foregoing rationale and the comments

                    <p>I will make Sec. <persName corresp="#p_CCM2">Clifford</persName>’s letter
                        available to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>.</p>
                    <p>“In response to your request that we look into <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Max Taylor</persName>’s suggestion for a resumption of the sort of
                        study last conducted by the Net Evaluation Subcommittee of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in 1963, I have had my staff review
                        existing studies to determine whether a new NES-type effort would be
                        worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, the NES studies were initiated in the 1950’s at a time when
                        our strategic capabilities were far less than they are today and more
                        significantly for purposes of a new study, we lacked the analytical
                        capability to assess relative U.S. and Soviet performance in various
                        scenarios. General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> and I find
                        that existing current material fully covers the ground of the Net Evaluation
                        studies.</p>
                    <p>Our intelligence in regard to Soviet capabilities has vastly improved, as
                        reflected in periodical <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>s on Soviet

                        will be forthcoming shortly (<gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss>s 11–8 and

                    <p rend="flushleft">Dear Max:</p>
                    <p>Thank you for sending me a copy of the memorandum you propose to send to the
                        President in regard to the <gloss target="#t_FIAB1">FIAB</gloss> proposal
                        for a new Net Evaluation Study.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">
                            <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note> In general you have done
                        justice in presenting my views, although there are many more evaluations
                        going on than I mentioned in my letter to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt

                        President.</p>
                    <p>I would like to emphasize, however, that while I believe a new administration
                        might wish to have a hand in initiating as far-reaching a study as you
                        propose, my main point is that existing studies and existing coordinating
                        mechanisms for bringing information to bear on the problem are adequate to
                        do the job.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say that there are no intelligence gaps, or that we intend to
                        rest on the merits of studies we have already completed. I am convinced,
                        however, that our current efforts are able to identify—and take steps to
                        fill—any gaps in our intelligence, our research and development, and our
                        analysis.</p>
                    <p>I believe that our current efforts have the interdepartmental inputs that you
                        feel would be the main benefit of your proposed study. What is lacking most
                        in our current efforts is the relaxed, long-range view that could best be
                        supplied by studies at IDA, Rand, etc. I have been promoting such studies
                        and would appreciate your help in focusing such studies on the pertinent
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>I have enclosed brief descriptions of a few of the more important continuing
                        efforts that we are making to evaluate the relative strategic strength of
                        the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. I would be
                        glad to provide briefings on any of these efforts to you personally or to

                        <p>Political-military war games are conducted and analyzed by the Joint War
                            Games Agency (<gloss target="#t_JWGA1">JWGA</gloss>). These
                            (non-computer) games explore major international issues, problems, and
                            questions bearing upon our national security. The White House, the
                            Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_ACDA1">ACDA</gloss>, and the
                            Military Services provide participants for these war games. These games
                            address broad political, economic, psychological, and technological
                            considerations as well as military strategy. The <gloss target="#t_JWGA1">JWGA</gloss> usually conducts at least four of
                            these games each year. They provide an excellent vehicle for obtaining
                            inter-departmental inputs for an examination for the relative strategic

                            to maximize the effectiveness of the Red forces and exploit known or
                            expected weaknesses of the U.S. strategic posture or forces. The <gloss target="#t_RISOP1">RISOP</gloss> is approved by the Joint Chiefs of

                            is being conducted in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> Special
                            Studies Group. It was initiated about two and one half years ago and is
                            now nearing completion. <gloss target="#t_PONAST1">PONAST</gloss>
                            considers two general war scenarios, which include strategic and theater
                            nuclear forces, in order to examine possible follow-on military and
                            non-military operations in the post-<gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> period of the war. The Office of Emergency Planning
                                (<gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss>) and the Office of Civil
                            Defense (<gloss target="#t_OCD1">OCD</gloss>) have been active <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0767"/>participants. Some twenty-seven
                            other agencies were called upon for various contributions, through the
                            auspices of <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss>. The Department of State
                            and the Defense Intelligence Agency have played major roles. The study
                            will identify problems that probably will confront national civilian and
                            military leaders during the successive stages of a general war, and will
                            assess capabilities to cope with such problems.</p>
                        <p>A feeling for the depth and scope of the study can be gained from the
                            fact that it took more than 4,000 hours of computing time on our most
                            modern computers. Except that it does not specifically focus attention
                            on gaps in intelligence data, it is exactly the kind of analysis that
                            appears to be envisioned by the <gloss target="#t_FIAB1">FIAB</gloss> in
                            that it evaluates the composition, reliability, effectiveness, and
                            vulnerability of the strategic offensive and defensive forces of both
                            sides, including their command and control systems. It also closely
                            studies the urban-industrial structures of both nations in order to
                            assess the probable effects of strategic attack on urban-industrial
                            targets, as well as the capability of the nations to recover from these
                            attacks. This study was based on the best available intelligence
                            information since the <gloss target="#t_RISOP1">RISOP</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_SIOP1">SIOP</gloss> war games, appropriately expanded,

                        <p>The Strategic Forces <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> presents the
                            recommendations of the Secretary of Defense on the strategic offensive
                            and defensive force structures for the next five years, as well as the
                            rationale behind these recommendations. An essential part of this
                            rationale is calculations of the ability of our strategic forces to
                            accomplish their major objective—deterrence of nuclear war.</p>
                        <p>To do this the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> first calculates the
                            capability of our programmed forces against a combination of the
                            upper-range of the National Intelligence Projections for Planning
                                (<gloss target="#t_NIPP1">NIPP</gloss>) projections for each element
                            of the Soviet strategic forces. Excursions then are made to study cases
                            where we lose major components of our forces, to make sure that our
                            capability is not vulnerable to an unforeseen technological
                            breakthrough. If these calculations show that our capability is not
                            sufficient, the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> recommends
                            developing and deploying enough forces to make it sufficient.</p>
                        <p>Next, the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> tests our programmed forces
                            against a threat specifically designed to take away our deterrent
                            capability. It then examines force options which will restore our
                            capability to an acceptable level against this threat. It also examines
                            the lead-times necessary for development of these options and recommends
                            actions which will insure that we can maintain our capability even
                            against this greater-than-expected threat.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> next examines our
                            capability to limit damage to the United States in the event that a
                            nuclear war occurs. In this situation the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> examines likely scenarios instead of the limiting ones
                            used to examine our deterrent capability. It also takes into account
                            possible Soviet reaction to the deployment of a U.S. damage limiting
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> is sent out for comment to the

                        through mid-1970 and to estimate general trends in those forces over the
                        next 10 years.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>The primary objectives of Soviet strategic policy have been to achieve
                            a more formidable deterrent and to narrow and eventually to overcome the
                            US lead in capabilities for intercontinental attack. Toward this end the
                            Soviets have built strategic forces, both offensive and defensive, which
                            provide a large assured destruction capability and important
                            damage-limiting capabilities as well. While they have only begun to
                            narrow the gap in submarine-launched ballistic missiles and remain
                            inferior in heavy bombers, the Soviets will shortly overcome the US lead
                            in numbers of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers. Current
                            programs will bring further improvements in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s strategic position, already the most favorable of
                            the postwar period. But the Soviets face in the future a strategic
                            situation changed and complicated by projected improvements in US
                            forces—Poseidon, Minuteman III, and the antiballistic missile
                            system—that threaten to erode their relative position.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>In deciding upon the future size and composition of their strategic
                            forces the Soviets are almost certainly exploring a number of
                            alternatives. They are evidently interested in strategic arms control as
                            an option that could conserve economic resources and protect their
                            improved strategic position. In the absence of an arms control
                            agreement, we believe that they will continue the arms competition with
                            the <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0772"/>US, seeking to maintain and
                            if possible improve their relative strategic position. In any case, they
                            will probably give increased attention to qualitative improvements,
                            particularly those designed to enhance survivability and capacity to
                            penetrate defenses.</item>

                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s strategic position results
                            primarily from the rapid and extensive <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> deployment of the past few years. The Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force now has about 900 operational
                            launchers and our evidence on construction activity indicates that it
                            will surpass the US force in numbers by 1970. The Soviets have begun
                            deployment of a small solid-propellant <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>, they probably are developing a new large
                            liquid-propellant system, and they probably will develop a mobile <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> system. In addition, they are
                            flight-testing multiple reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MRV1">MRV</gloss>s).</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>We believe that for the period of this estimate the Soviet force goal
                            will lie somewhere between 1,100 and 1,500 <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> launchers.<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">For the

                            the low side, the Soviet <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force
                            would probably peak at a higher level until older launchers were phased
                            out. Such a force would probably embody considerable qualitative
                            improvements including better accuracy, more sophisticated reentry
                            vehicles such as <gloss target="#t_MRV1">MRV</gloss>s and multiple
                            independently-targeted reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s), and possibly penetration aids. A force toward the
                            higher side of our estimate would also include qualitative improvements,
                            and it would rely in part upon larger numbers to attain improved

                            <hi rend="italic">Space Weapons</hi>. At the time of our last estimate
                            the Soviets were conducting extensive flight tests which we believed
                            related to development of a fractional orbit bombardment system (<gloss target="#t_FOBS1">FOBS</gloss>). Developments since that time have
                            lowered our confidence that we understand the intended purpose of the
                            system under test; the Soviets may be trying to develop a <gloss target="#t_FOBS1">FOBS</gloss>, a depressed trajectory
                            intercontinental ballistic missile, or perhaps a dual system which could
                            perform both missions. Until our evidence is more conclusive, we are
                            unable to make a confident estimate as to the type of system being
                            developed, when it could reach initial operational capability (<gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss>), or how it may be deployed. We
                            continue to believe it unlikely that the Soviets will develop a multiple
                            orbit bombardment system.</item>

                                Ballistic Missile (<gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM).</hi>
                            There has been little change in the size of the <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>/IRBM force, which still stands at about 700 launchers.
                            We estimate that new <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss>s and IRBMs
                            will supersede present systems <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0773"/>within the next 10 years. The Soviets will continue to maintain
                            massive strategic forces against Eurasia, but the introduction of
                            improved missiles may result in some decrease in numbers. We believe
                            that the Soviets are developing and will deploy, in both a fixed and a
                            mobile configuration, a new solid-propellant <gloss target="#t_MRBM1">MRBM</gloss> (designated SS–14) of about 1,500 n.m. range which
                            could reach <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> in a year or two. We
                            estimate that they will also develop a solid-propellant IRBM with a
                            range of about 3,000–3,500 n.m., and that it will reach <gloss target="#t_IOC1">IOC</gloss> in 1970–1971. It will probably be
                            deployed in both fixed and mobile launchers and with its extended range
                            will provide more flexible coverage of Eurasian targets.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Submarine-Launched Missiles.</hi> The Soviets have
                            clearly embarked upon a high priority program to improve and expand
                            their ballistic missile submarine force. Six, possibly 7, of the 16-tube
                            Y-class submarines have now come down the ways and there is evidence
                            suggesting that the production of this class will be stepped up soon. We
                            believe that the Soviets are building toward a ballistic missile
                            submarine force that will confront the US with a threat roughly
                            comparable to that which the Polaris force presents the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They could reach that position by
                            the mid-1970’s, when they will probably have some 65–80 ballistic
                            missile submarines, of which 35–50 will be Y-class types.</item>

                            <hi rend="italic">Long-Range Aviation</hi>. Attrition and retirement of
                            older models will gradually reduce the Soviet heavy bomber force. The
                            medium-bomber force will probably also decline as Badgers are phased
                            out, but at a slower rate than we estimated last year. The introduction
                            of a new air-to-surface missile into the Badger force suggests that the
                            Soviets intend to extend the useful life of some of those aircraft for a
                            few more years. We still believe that the Soviets are unlikely to
                            introduce a follow-on heavy bomber; they may introduce a follow-on
                            medium if the Blinder does not satisfy their future requirements.<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">For the position of Maj. Gen.

                        <item>The most important issues of Soviet military policy concern the
                            strategic balance between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The goals of Soviet strategic weapons programs were
                            set at a time when the US enjoyed such a superiority in intercontinental
                            delivery systems as to put the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> at
                            a political and psychological disadvantage. The aim of Soviet strategic
                            policy, therefore, has been to achieve a more formidable deterrent and
                            to narrow and eventually to overcome the US lead. Toward this end, the
                            Soviets have built strategic forces, both offensive and defensive, <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0774"/>which provide a large assured
                            destruction capability and important damage-limiting capabilities as
                            well, and they have substantially reduced the US lead in numbers of
                            intercontinental delivery vehicles.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>The great improvement in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s
                            strategic position results from the buildup of Soviet strategic forces
                            begun by Khrushchev several years ago. The new leaders have made some
                            decisions as to the size and composition of their strategic forces, but
                            they have generally followed the strategic policies and programs that
                            they inherited. In the future, however, they face a strategic situation
                            significantly changed from that which led to present Soviet policies.
                            Projected improvements in US strategic forces—Poseidon, Minuteman III,
                            and the antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>)
                            system—threaten to erode their relative position. Now the Soviet leaders
                            are confronted with the necessity for new decisions on the future size
                            and composition of their strategic forces. Other military requirements
                            and the growing needs of the general economy are among the factors which
                            the leaders must consider in making these decisions.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Under the collective leadership, military expenditures have continued
                            to rise, primarily as the result of the continuing development and
                            large-scale deployment of strategic weapons, which account for about
                            half of the total military expenditures. The requirements of these
                            programs for scarce high-quality resources of the sort needed to sustain
                            economic growth have aggravated the impact of defense spending on the
                            economy. Now, events in the Far East and in Europe have posed new
                            military requirements which probably will result in a substantial
                            increase in the strength of Soviet theater forces. Thus the perennial
                            problem of resource allocation promises to sharpen. Economic
                            considerations almost certainly were among the principal reasons for the
                            Soviet decision to discuss arms control with the US.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Nevertheless, the economic considerations contributing to the Soviet
                            decision are probably no more compelling than the strategic
                            considerations. Considering US plans for improvements in its strategic
                            forces, the Soviets probably recognize that a considerable sustained
                            effort would be necessary to maintain the relative position they have
                            now achieved. They may also be concerned lest the end of the Vietnam War
                            enable the US to divert additional resources to its strategic forces.
                            Finally, they may reason that further increments to their strategic
                            forces would have little effect on the relationship between the US and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> so long as the US maintained
                            its large, second-strike assured destruction capability. If these
                            arguments were to prevail in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            the Soviets would probably seek an agreement that preserved their
                            present strategic relationship with the US.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>It is too early to assess the full implications of the Czech crisis
                            for Soviet policy toward arms control. The Soviets still have the same
                            basic <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0775"/>economic and military
                            incentives; indeed, it is possible that the new military requirements
                            generated by the Czech crisis have added to those incentives. Moreover,
                            the present Soviet line seems to be that the Czech crisis is an internal
                            Communist Bloc affair that should have no effect on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>’s relations with the US. It is
                            possible, therefore, that the Soviets will seek to proceed with arms
                            control talks. At a minimum, however, the Czech crisis has delayed the
                            opening of talks with the US and has dampened the prospects of any real
                            progress toward strategic arms control in the near term.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>In any case, the Soviet leaders cannot base their strategic planning
                            on the possibility of strategic arms control and will almost certainly
                            explore other alternatives. At a minimum, they might consider a policy
                            of deterrence aimed only at maintaining a large assured destruction
                            capability. Or they might consider a try for strategic superiority of
                            such an order that it could be translated into significant political
                            gain. We consider it highly unlikely that the Soviets will select either
                            of these courses of action. The first, that of unilateral deescalation,
                            would involve a decision to sacrifice the hard-won gains of recent
                            years. The second would involve economic sacrifices that are probably
                            unacceptable to the present leadership and would almost certainly
                            provoke a strong US reaction. We believe, therefore, that in the absence
                            of a strategic arms control agreement, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will continue the arms competition with the US with
                            the object of maintaining and if possible improving its relative
                            strategic position.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>For several years, the Soviets have given the highest priority to the
                            effort to overcome the US lead in numbers of intercontinental delivery
                            vehicles, particularly in intercontinental ballistic missiles (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s). By 1970, the Soviets will probably
                            surpass the US force in numbers of <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>
                            launchers but they will remain inferior in submarine-launched ballistic
                            missiles and heavy bombers. To maintain an assured destruction
                            capability in the strategic situation that is emerging, qualitative
                            improvements, particularly those related to survivability and capacity
                            to penetrate defenses, become more important. There will undoubtedly be
                            pressures for a continuing enlargement of the <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss> force, and it may continue to grow. But having
                            attained rough numerical parity with the US in <gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s, the Soviets will probably give increased attention
                            to other options designed to enhance the survivability and effectiveness
                            of their strategic attack forces.</item>

                        <label>A.</label>
                        <item>Throughout the postwar period the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has devoted a major effort to strategic defense. This
                            effort can be attributed primarily to the size and diversity of US
                            strategic attack forces, although for the future the Soviets must
                            consider the threat posed by third countries, particularly China.</item>
                        <label>B.</label>
                        <item>We believe that the competition for resources in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is likely to intensify, not only
                            between civilian and military programs, but also within the military
                            establishment. These pressures may exercise a restraining influence on
                            the strategic defense effort, but are unlikely to reduce it below
                            present levels. The trend for the longer term will depend heavily upon
                            Soviet decisions concerning antiballistic missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) deployment and the related question of
                            strategic arms control.</item>
                        <label>C.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets have built a formidable system of air defenses, deployed
                            in depth, which would be very effective against subsonic and
                            low-supersonic aircraft attempting to penetrate at medium and high
                            altitudes. The system is less effective against higher performance
                            aircraft and standoff weapons; it has virtually no capability <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0780"/>against low-altitude
                            penetration below about 1,000 feet except in a few, limited areas. The
                            Soviets recognize these shortcomings and are deploying new interceptors,
                            surface-to-air missiles (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s), and
                            radars in an effort to overcome them.</item>
                        <label>D.</label>
                        <item>At present, the major effort is directed to counter the threat posed
                            by high-performance aircraft and standoff weapons. Deployment of the
                            SA–5 long-range <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system is the
                            largest single defensive weapon program now underway. This system
                            represents a considerable improvement over older systems in terms of
                            range, velocity, and firepower. It is being deployed as a barrier
                            defense around the European <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            for point defense of selected targets. We estimate that there are some
                            60 SA–5 complexes, and that nearly half are operational; we believe that
                            some 100 complexes will be operational by 1973. The Soviets have also
                            been testing an airborne warning and control system (<gloss target="#t_AWACS1">AWACS</gloss>) that will probably enter service
                            soon. This system, deployed in coastal areas and used with long-range
                            interceptors, could greatly extend the area in which incoming aircraft
                            could be engaged.</item>
                        <label>E.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets are also attempting to strengthen their air defenses
                            against low-altitude attack, but their efforts of the past year have
                            resulted in minor improvements rather than in any fundamental solution
                            to the problem. They have deployed all-weather interceptors with
                            improved capabilities for low-altitude attack, and they will probably
                            introduce more advanced <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s and
                            interceptors better suited for low-altitude defense. The primary
                            limitation on low-altitude defense, however, is surveillance and
                            control. Deployment of new radars has improved tracking capabilities in
                            limited areas down to altitudes of 500 feet and even below, but we
                            expect little advance in ground-based continuous tracking capability at
                            low altitudes during the period of this estimate.</item>
                        <label>F.</label>
                        <item>The Moscow <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>-1), under deployment since 1962, has
                            probably achieved some operational capability. Its deployment has
                            apparently been cut back substantially from the originally planned
                            level; the elements still under construction will probably be
                            operational in 1970. We believe that the Soviets plan additional
                            deployment of an improved <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system at
                            Moscow. <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> development continues, but
                            we cannot determine whether it involves an improved version of the
                            Moscow system or a substantially improved, second-generation <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system, although we consider the latter
                            more likely. We still do not believe that there is any deployment of
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses outside the Moscow
                            area. We believe that the SA–5 long-range <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss> system is unlikely to have a present <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability, although the state of
                            available evidence does not permit us to exclude <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0781"/>this possibility, and we consider it
                            unlikely that it will be modified for an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> role.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">For the views of Maj.

                            initial operational capability in the 1973–1975 period; like the Moscow
                            system, it will probably be designed for long range, exoatmospheric
                            intercept. The extent of future deployment will depend heavily upon
                            economic as well as technical considerations. Deployment of a national
                            defense system on a scale sufficient to cope with the full US missile
                            threat does not appear to be a feasible course of action for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> within the period of this estimate.
                            We believe that the Soviets will decide upon a program that would
                            provide some defense for the most important target areas in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Some part of this defense would
                            probably be deployed against Communist China and other third country
                            threats.</item>

                        <item>We have no evidence of a Soviet antisatellite weapons program nor of
                            Soviet development of hardware specifically for this purpose. It would
                            be technically possible, however, for the Soviets now to have a limited
                            antisatellite capability. With existing radars and missiles armed with
                            nuclear warheads, they could almost certainly destroy or neutralize
                            current US satellites up to about 2,000 n.m. during an early phase of
                            their mission. With terminal homing in the interceptor missile, they may
                            even be able to neutralize satellites using a nonnuclear warhead. Soviet
                            technical capabilities are such that they could develop and deploy
                            during the next 10 years any of several types of antisatellite systems
                            if they chose to do so. We believe, however, that the Soviets would
                            realize that any use of antisatellite systems in peacetime would expose
                            their own satellites to attack, and consider it unlikely that they would
                            do so except in retaliation.</item>

                        <item>Soviet strategic defense forces have gone through several stages of
                            development since World War II. Through the mid-1950’s the Soviets
                            attempted to counter the large US strategic bomber force in being with
                            large numbers of air surveillance radars and interceptor aircraft,
                            reinforced at Moscow with large numbers of surface-to-air missiles
                                (<gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>s). As the US force obtained
                            higher performance intercontinental bombers, <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0782"/>the Soviets in the late 1950’s developed and deployed
                            Mach 2 interceptors and extended <gloss target="#t_SAM1">SAM</gloss>
                            defenses throughout the country. When the US, in the face of this
                            extensive defense, began practicing low-altitude penetration tactics,
                            the Soviets began in the early 1960’s deploying the Firebar interceptor
                            and the SA–3, both possessing better capabilities for low-altitude
                            intercept than earlier systems. The US deployment of a standoff
                            capability with air-to-surface missiles (<gloss target="#t_ASM1">ASM</gloss>s), was followed by Soviet development and the current
                            deployment of the Fiddler interceptor and the SA–5 system, which have
                            greater ranges than earlier systems.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>In their efforts to have a defense in being against an immediate
                            threat, the Soviets have generally deployed a system quite early in the
                            development cycle, using available technology, rather than wait for the
                            development of more advanced but unproven techniques. These systems have
                            then generally been modified and improved during the period of
                            deployment. In some cases, however, deployment has been canceled early
                            in the program either because the system proved relatively ineffective
                            or because a better one was in the offing. When an improved system has
                            been deployed, older ones are not rapidly retired or replaced. The
                            Soviets tend to have extensive defenses deployed in depth, usually with
                            considerable redundancy. This redundancy may give the defenses as a
                            whole a greater capability than analysis of each weapon system alone
                            would indicate. On the other hand, some elements of the defenses are
                            always somewhat out of date, and do not represent the most effective
                            Soviet counter to new US systems or concepts of operation.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Soviet military planners probably see the US strategic threat in the
                            mid-1970’s as consisting of three major forces: bombers and <gloss target="#t_ASM1">ASM</gloss>s, intercontinental ballistic missiles
                                (<gloss target="#t_ICBM1">ICBM</gloss>s), and submarine-launched
                            ballistic missiles (<gloss target="#t_SLBM1">SLBM</gloss>s). They are
                            aware that the threat will become more sophisticated and formidable with
                            the incorporation of improvements—new aircraft, <gloss target="#t_ASM1">ASM</gloss>s, aerodynamic and ballistic penetration aids, and
                            multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicles (<gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss>s). The weight of a US attack could be
                            increased by the strategic forces of Britain and France; the Soviets
                            probably view the British forces as simply adding to the Polaris threat,
                            but French intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) deployment will
                            pose a threat from a new quarter.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The Soviets probably believe that the massive air defense forces they
                            have built and are building will provide an effective counter to the
                            medium and high-altitude bomber threat, although they realize the
                            problem of low-altitude defense is not yet satisfactorily solved. The
                            most critical requirement of Soviet strategic defense, and the one most
                            difficult to meet despite more than a decade of effort, however, is
                            defense against ballistic missiles. The nature and extent of
                            antiballistic <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0783"/>missile (<gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>) deployment is almost certainly one of
                            the major questions of Soviet military policy.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>For the period of this estimate, the US and its allies will continue
                            to pose the principal strategic threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but Soviet military planners must also be concerned
                            with the emerging strategic capabilities of a hostile China. The
                            substantial military buildup along the Chinese border over the past few
                            years has consisted primarily of theater forces. The strengthening of
                            air defenses has been modest in comparison, and at a deliberate pace
                            that in the Soviet view probably matches Chinese offensive capabilities.
                            The Soviets almost certainly believe that their great superiority in
                            offensive strategic weapons will enable them to cope with any threat
                            that might materialize in the foreseeable future, and they hope for a
                            political change in China that would remove this possibility. For the
                            longer term, however, Moscow must consider the problem of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> defenses against a new threat from the
                            south.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Soviet decisions as to how best to meet the strategic threat of the
                            mid-1970’s will be affected not only by the Soviet view of the threat
                            and the pace of technological development, but also by the constraints
                            of economics. The present Soviet leadership has shown a general
                            disposition to accommodate military programs, and military expenditures
                            have continued to rise. Moreover, within the military establishment
                            strategic defense has long enjoyed a favored position. We estimate that
                            the Soviet strategic defense effort is larger, both in absolute terms
                            and as a share of the total military budget, than that of the US.
                            Developments of the past year, however, have strengthened the demands of
                            competing claimants, both civilian and military. The Soviet leaders have
                            shown rising concern over the adverse effects of military spending upon
                            economic growth; we believe that this was a major consideration in their
                            decision to discuss strategic arms control with the US. Now the Czech
                            crisis has raised new requirements for theater forces in Europe which,
                            together with the continuing buildup on the Chinese border, will
                            probably bring a significant increase in Soviet theater forces. Thus, we
                            believe that competition is likely to intensify, not only between
                            civilian and military programs, but also within the military
                            establishment.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>Current pressures may exercise a restraining influence on the
                            strategic defense effort, but are unlikely to reduce it. For the near
                            term, at least, expenditures for strategic defense will probably be
                            maintained at their present high level, while military expenditures as a
                            whole continue to rise. The trend for the longer term will depend
                            heavily upon Soviet decisions concerning <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment—potentially the most costly single military
                            program on the horizon—and the related question of strategic arms
                            control. If the Soviets embark upon any sizable new <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0784"/>program of <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment within the next few years, expenditures for
                            strategic defense will increase and by the middle 1970’s are likely to
                            exceed those for strategic attack by a substantial margin.</item>

                        recent years has resulted in a substantial increase in the size, cost,

                        many departments and agencies take part. Most of the money and manpower
                        resources devoted to foreign intelligence activities are allocated to
                        intelligence-related elements of the Department of Defense, including the
                        Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the

                        Cryptologic Agencies of the Military Services; and the National Security
                        Agency. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] The
                        remaining costs, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        Defense and to the intelligence components of the Department of State and
                        the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>The magnitude of this effort is a reflection of the steadily increasing
                        volume of intelligence collection requirements levied upon the system. A
                        substantial portion of our intelligence resources is allocated to the
                        top-priority acquisition of data concerning the strategic military
                        capabilities (offensive and defensive) of the Soviet Union and Communist
                        China. The war in Vietnam has added greatly to the burden of our
                        intelligence agencies. The need to know more about economic, political and
                        military developments in newly-emerging nations has added further to the
                        intelligence workload. If, in the aftermath of the Vietnam war, there should
                        be a trend to review and possibly to revise U.S. commitments abroad, there
                        will be a corresponding requirement for intelligence to serve as a basis for
                        such judgments.</p>
                    <p>In the course of meeting national intelligence needs, it has become necessary
                        to develop advanced and elaborate facilities for the collection and analysis
                        of information in great volume. These facilities include photographic
                        reconnaissance aircraft and satellite systems [<hi rend="italic">3–1/2 lines
                            of source text not declassified</hi>]. A portion of the U.S.
                        intelligence effort is concerned with espionage and counterespionage
                        activities, including penetrations abroad of foreign governmental regimes,
                        military organizations, political groups, and the development of
                        intelligence resources among the diplomatic corps abroad. There are also
                        overt collection sources such as the observations of hundreds of U.S.
                        diplomats and Military Attaches; voluminous information is acquired daily
                        from foreign broadcasts, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                            not declassified</hi>] and other sources, adding to the heavy burdens of
                        analysis placed upon the U.S. intelligence system.</p>
                    <p>All of these activities produce information essential for the preparation of
                        estimates of enemy capabilities and intentions, and provide the intelligence
                        base required for the formulation of U.S. foreign policy and for defense and
                        budgetary planning. For the indefinite future, we foresee the continuing
                        demand for an ever-improving intelligence system to meet critical needs of
                        the decision-makers in the fields of foreign policy and national
                        security.</p>

                    <p>The Board is the only organization of the Executive Branch having the
                        responsibility for maintaining a continuing scrutiny of the complex but
                        indispensable U.S. foreign intelligence effort, an effort which is <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0787"/>large, expensive and
                        widely-dispersed. The complexity of the effort and magnitude of the
                        resources involved are such that the Board’s concerns include proper
                        utilization of the powers and authorities of the departments and agencies
                        engaged in intelligence and associated activities. In the discharge of its
                        functions the Board has conducted intermittent reviews of all significant
                        intelligence activities of the several agencies engaged therein, including
                        those of the Central Intelligence Agency; the Departments of State, Defense,
                        Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the National
                        Security Agency; the Service Cryptologic Agencies; the Joint Chiefs of

                        the Federal Bureau of Investigation (particularly counterintelligence). The
                        Board has received the generous cooperation of the senior officials and
                        subordinates of these departments and agencies.</p>
                    <p>The review function of the Board has not only served to keep it fully
                        informed, but has also had the beneficial effect of causing the component
                        agencies of the intelligence community to test and examine on a continuing
                        basis the performance of their respective roles and responsibilities.</p>

                                39 days. At these meetings the Board has: (a) received extensive
                                briefings from representatives of the intelligence community on
                                significant current intelligence developments and problems; (b)
                                reviewed and acted upon reports of the Board’s Panels and reports of
                                on-the-scene reviews made by representatives of the Board; (c) held

                                Others have examined the scientific and technological aspects of
                                intelligence operations. Still others have dealt <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0788"/>with the organizational and

                                    attached great importance to its on-the-scene reviews in the
                                    U.S. and abroad. It has been a long standing practice for
                                    individual Board members, together with the Executive Secretary,
                                    to make first-hand examinations of our intelligence operations
                                    in various regions of the world. Overseas these reviews have
                                    included consultations with U.S. Ambassadors, Chiefs of the
                                    Political and Economic Sections of our Embassies, our <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Station Chiefs, our Defense
                                    Attaches and others as appropriate. Through personal
                                    observations, briefings and discussions Board representatives
                                    have been able to obtain a vivid picture of our intelligence
                                    activities, of the operational environment in which they are
                                    conducted, and of the special problems faced by our intelligence
                                    personnel in the field. At the same time we believe that these
                                    on-the-scene reviews, known to have been made on behalf of the
                                    President, have served to stimulate morale and job performance
                                    among the representatives of the intelligence agencies.</p>
                                <p>Recent overseas reviews conducted by the Board have included
                                    surveys of U.S. intelligence activities in Southeast Asia, the
                                    Far East, Western Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. In
                                    some of these areas, where critical U.S. intelligence interests
                                    were involved, repeated on-the-scene surveys were made by
                                    representatives of the Board. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of

                    <p>Although gratifying advances have been made in our national intelligence
                        effort (a few important examples of which are cited above) there remain a

                                President</hi>. As the Board’s recent review of the performance of
                                the intelligence community at the time of the Tet offensive has
                                again emphasized, there is still an unresolved problem of meeting
                                the President’s day-to-day—sometimes hour-to-hour—requirements for
                                intelligence without excessive resort to spot reports by-passing the
                                responsible evaluation process of the intelligence apparatus. The
                                problem consists of two parts—first, how to keep the Director of
                                Central Intelligence continuously aware of the changing intelligence
                                interests and needs of the President, and second, how to respond
                                thereto with minimum delay. Whatever procedure is developed to meet
                                this need, it is essential that the Director of Central Intelligence
                                should continue to have a close rapport with the President and be,
                                in every sense, his principal intelligence officer.</p>
                            <p>A possible means of meeting the need of the President for timely,
                                evaluated spot intelligence would be for the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> to assign a senior intelligence officer to the
                                White House to work alongside the Special Assistant to the President
                                for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Affairs for the purpose of

                                process could include a small group of analysts working directly
                                under the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss> for the specific

                            this subject is deserving of priority attention on a continuing

                            The Board believes that national security interests would benefit from
                            the establishment of an interagency mechanism (representing civilian and
                            military departments and agencies) for making periodic, comparative

                            activities, the Board believes that an even greater effort should be
                            made to ensure that the substantial and innovative resources of the

                            The Board is aware of the review that is being conducted of the future
                            need for the overseas bases and installations which are presently
                            maintained in support of our foreign policy. Among those which may be
                            considered for elimination there undoubtedly will be some having
                            important intelligence functions which, in the interest of the national
                            security, must continue to be performed. The Board urges that
                            intelligence requirements receive careful consideration before making
                            decisions to eliminate bases having important intelligence missions
                            which cannot otherwise be performed.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have directed attention in this report to selected topics which we believe
                        should continue to receive priority attention by Government officials having
                        responsibility for the management and implementation of the national
                        intelligence program. There are other aspects of the intelligence effort
                        which have been the subject of Board studies, reports and specific
                        recommendations, and are in our opinion appropriate for periodic
                        reexamination and follow-up action.</p>
                    <p>In closing, we would like to reiterate our feeling of the increasing
                        importance of the national intelligence effort to our security. It is a
                        field <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0796"/>of great complexity requiring
                        the services of thousands of dedicated professionals of ability, training
                        and experience who should receive the firm and continuing support of senior
                        officials of Government. It is of the utmost importance to attract and
                        retain these valuable specialists and instill in them an esprit de corps
                        based on a feeling of the importance of their work and the esteem in which
                        it is held by the nation. The Board has noted in recent times an unhappy
                        tendency in Congress, the press and elsewhere to denigrate intelligence in
                        the public eye and to undermine public confidence in our intelligence
                        agencies, particularly the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. This
                        dangerous trend is in part fomented by foreign and domestic enemies of our
                        national security. The Board expresses the hope that in the future the
                        senior spokesmen of Government will continue to give serious thought to the
                        need, in the national interest, to reverse this trend and to give voice to
                        the importance and quality of the work being done by the intelligence
                        community.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President, recognizing the financial constraints under which the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 budget is being developed, the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> decided against addressing
                            individual issues as has been the custom in the past. Instead, we <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0798"/>propose to discuss the general
                            posture of our armed forces with emphasis on the impact of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 budget decisions on present and future
                            military capabilities. I will provide a brief assessment and each
                            Service Chief will provide illustrative examples highlighting his key
                            areas of concerns.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are fully aware of the wide
                            variety of demands on our nation’s resources and the hard decisions
                            which must be taken in allocating these resources. The war in Southeast
                            Asia, coupled with the dangerous situation in Northeast Asia, and the
                            unstable and uncertain environments in the Middle East and Europe,
                            challenge our capability for adequate and timely response to other
                            contingencies which might arise.</p>

                        <p>The Soviet threat continues to expand in size and improve in quality.
                            There is no indication that it is leveling off nor is there any sign of
                            self-imposed limitations based upon achievement of a particular force
                            capability. We expect an increase in Soviet land and sea-based missiles,
                            an increased deployment of anti-ballistic missiles, an improvement in
                            air defense, and an overall improvement of their general purpose
                            forces.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Despite US progress in certain areas, rapid increases in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> capabilities have eroded our once
                            clearly superior strategic position.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet missile force is growing in size. Our strategic force is
                            undergoing qualitative improvements, such as Poseidon and Minuteman III,
                            which will increase our force effectiveness; however, it is programmed
                            to remain static in numbers. While our bomber force is being reduced,
                            the loss in numbers is partially offset by the introduction of a
                            short-range attack missile and a new decoy missile. Our capability to
                            defend the continental US against the bomber threat will be reduced by
                            force reductions programmed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70.
                            The lack of an effective ballistic missile defense is also cause for
                            concern, although the planned Sentinel deployment represents a
                            significant first step in this direction.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are concerned with the decreased
                            readiness of our general purpose forces and their capability to respond
                            to possible worldwide contingencies. Our fighting forces in Vietnam are
                            the best equipped and supported in history; however, the higher
                            priorities given Southeast Asia, together with manpower and funding
                            limitations, have resulted in constraints on personnel and materiel in
                            other areas of the world. The <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0799"/>resulting personnel turbulence, curtailment of training, and
                            diversions of logistic assets to meet unprogrammed requirements magnify
                            the deficiencies in our current military posture.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, the plan for the improvement and modernization of the
                            Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces is receiving priority attention and
                            support. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> note, however, that it
                            will require diversions of service equipment programmed and procured for
                            US forces. An uncompensated diversion of materiel from US forces will

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> consider that US strategic force
                            levels, when compared with the growing Soviet strategic capabilities,
                            represent a declining trend in the US strategic position vis-à-vis the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Additionally, we believe that
                            the existing conventional capability of our general purpose forces
                            provides only a limited choice of options at the present time outside
                            Southeast Asia. It does not provide the capability to reinforce <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> adequately in a timely manner, nor of
                            simultaneously providing a response to other than minor contingencies
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Risks associated with the capabilities of our programmed forces can be
                            reduced by short-term actions such as: (1) improving the readiness of
                            deployed forces, (2) modernizing current forces, (3) retaining forces
                            scheduled for phase down, and (4) providing adequate logistic
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Deferral of such actions is generating an accumulation of unfunded
                            requirements which reduce current force capabilities and will have an
                            adverse impact on force capabilities in the future.</p>
                        <p>In amplification of these judgments, and to provide further insight into

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> regretted that General
                            <persName>Wood</persName>, Director of the Study,<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">This study, a review of U.S. overseas base

                        try to meet with General <persName>Wood</persName> later on to obtain his
                        personal views and conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said he recognized that
                            <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> members had not had a great deal of
                        time to review the study. But, inasmuch as the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> had commissioned this work, he felt the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> should discuss next steps. Also, any
                        preliminary comments <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> members might have
                        would be helpful in the follow-on.</p>
                    <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0801"/>
                    <p>He personally found the report a very valuable, interesting document. He had
                        no doubt that it would have a significant influence on policy making. It was
                        encyclopedic in its survey of our overseas installations and facilities.
                        Even if this were all, it would have considerable value to the new
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> noted the separate
                        treatment on overseas intelligence facilities. He would like to discuss this
                        volume with General <persName>Wood</persName> in a more restricted
                        forum.</p>

                    <p>The Ambassador said he would like to pay tribute to General
                            <persName>Wood</persName>’s role in the project. General
                            <persName>Wood</persName> had provided intellectual leadership and
                        teamwork. The Study clearly had his personal imprint.</p>
                    <p>The Study was the first effort in some 10 years to review all of our overseas
                        installations and facilities. It differed in several respects from the
                        earlier Nash report:<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">Frank C. Nash, former
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs,
                            headed a task force during the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration to study the problem of
                            preserving U.S. overseas bases. The study was completed in December
                            1957, adopted with some revisions at a meeting of the National Security
                            Council on March 13, 1958, and approved by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> 2 days later. See <ref target="frus1955-57v19#pg_334">

                            <item>First, it examined our overseas base requirements on the basis of
                                alternative strategies and options, whereas the earlier study has
                                simply projected current doctrine;</item>
                            <item>Secondly, it covered intelligence facilities, as well as other

                            <item>Thirdly, it considered in some depth a series of special technical
                                problems associated with our installations, including their balance
                                of payments and budgetary cost, the relationship with military and
                                economic assistance programs, the implications of disarmament and
                                arms control, and the impact of the accelerated advance of science
                                and technology.</item>

                    </p>
                    <p>In preparing the Study, Ambassador McClintock said, the Group had examined
                        United States security interests and commitments, and prospective trends in
                        the world environment during the 1970s. In addition, it had prepared a
                        comprehensive tabulation of all our installations and facilities
                        country-by-country.</p>
                    <p>The United States now had overseas about the same number of people as it had
                        ten years ago. These numbers, however, included troops deployed in Viet-Nam.
                        Excluding Viet-Nam, personnel had been cut by half. These reductions were
                        not concentrated in any one place but ranged from Korea and North Africa and
                        Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>The Study fell into two parts—our overseas facilities as related to global
                        requirements and the facilities needed essentially for the support of
                        regional policies.</p>
                    <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0802"/>
                    <p>In the first category, the Group had considered the requirements for
                        strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems, <gloss target="#t_ASW1">ASW</gloss>, intelligence, early warning systems, and for research and
                        scientific activities such as <gloss target="#t_NASA1">NASA</gloss> tracking
                        stations and the atomic energy detecting system.</p>
                    <p>As regards the treatment of regional policies and strategies, the Ambassador
                        noted the alternative approaches discussed in the summary of the report,
                        namely, the choice, for purposes of analysis, of assuming alternative base
                        structures and examining their strategic implications, or of specifying
                        alternative strategies and developing base systems to support them. The
                        Group had chosen the latter course.</p>
                    <p>This was a basic point of methodology. It involved eight essential steps.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>—First, specify the military deployment requirements to support a
                            particular regional strategy.</item>
                        <item>—Second, determine which of these deployment patterns would require
                            changes in the base structure.</item>
                        <item>—Third, lay out the available base structure.</item>
                        <item>—Fourth, assess the probability that the existing base facilities
                            would not be retainable for political reasons.</item>
                        <item>—Fifth, evaluate the vulnerability of the facilities to enemy
                            attack.</item>
                        <item>—Sixth, assess the extent to which available bases would support
                            various regional strategies.</item>
                        <item>—Seventh, highlight the specific changes from the present base
                            structure required to support various regional strategies.</item>

                    </list>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>McClintock</persName> said the key chapter in the Study
                        was Chapter 5, entitled “Policy-Strategy Alternatives and Base Structures
                        for the 1970s”, which reviewed in some detail the base structures required
                        for support of each regional strategy. Each base and base complex had been
                        costed out in terms of its initial investment cost and the annual balance of
                        payments drain or savings.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, these cost estimates were fairly rough. In the case of
                        the Pacific region, however, the various regional strategies had been
                        subjected to a much more detailed costing by a special sub-group (Vol.
                        VII).</p>
                    <p>The Study Group had been much encouraged because the results of this detailed
                        costing were about the same as the rough estimates made by the Study Group
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>This was the first time that major strategies for a world region had been
                        subjected to this kind of systematic analysis.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>McClintock</persName> stressed that the Study Group had
                        set forth certain broad alternatives only. They evidently had not been able
                        to consider all the variations. One of the first tasks was to pinpoint which
                        of these strategies should be analyzed in greater depth—a task for the new
                        Administration.</p>
                    <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0803"/>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>McClintock</persName> then proceeded to review the
                        results of the regional analyses.</p>
                    <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>, the Study outlined five alternative
                        strategies. The major constraint was that of geography. Unlike Asia, there
                        was no realistic off-shore, over the horizon, deployment possibility. United
                        States forces must be deployed in an area allowing only limited defense in
                        depth—or they must be deployed 3,000 miles away in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The two key strategies were those of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                        <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>—alternative 2A—and of forward defense
                        with early selective use of nuclear weapons—alternative 3. The latter would
                        result in an annual $250 million balance of payments saving. The other
                        strategies—alternatives 4 and 5—which assumed a thinning out—or removal—of
                        the United States presence—envisaged a European (conventional and tactical
                        nuclear) build-up to compensate for the withdrawal of the United States
                        forces. They would permit an annual balance of payments saving of up to
                        $1.25 billion (alternative 5).</p>
                    <p>Turning to the <hi rend="italic">Pacific</hi>, Ambassador
                            <persName>McClintock</persName> noted that the problem here had been to
                        formulate alternative policies in a post Viet-Nam environment. One important
                        conclusion was that withdrawal of forces from the mainland of Asia must not
                        be equated with a budgetary saving because of the cost of moving United
                        States forces to alternate locations and the cost of new installations in
                        these locations. In fact, some of the withdrawal strategies were extremely
                        expensive, e.g., redeployment of United States forces to Hawaii and the
                        Pacific Trust Territories.</p>
                    <p>For each alternative, it was assumed that United States forces available for
                        various contingencies were those of existing <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>s.</p>
                    <p>Another important point was the trade-off between military assistance and
                        United States forces deployments. For example, alternative 4 assumed forward
                        defense on the mainland by indigenous forces only. This strategy involved an
                        annual balance of payments saving of about $600 million. But, to be fully
                        implemented, it would entail an estimated investment cost of $5–$10 billion
                        over, say, a ten year period to modernize indigenous forces.</p>
                    <p>A third conclusion was the critical importance of the Pacific Trust
                        Territories. The United States did not now possess clear title to these
                        territories. There was some danger that the Japanese would become so popular
                        with the islanders that a plebiscite would return the islands to the
                        Japanese.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> noted that the problem
                        was one of Congressional attitudes. There was unanimity within the Executive
                        Branch on the need to do more in these Territories. He felt some progress
                        had been made this past year in increasing Congressional awareness of the
                        importance of this problem.</p>
                    <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0804"/>
                    <p>As regards the <hi rend="italic">Western Hemisphere</hi>, Ambassador
                            <persName>McClintock</persName> said the Study had considered three,
                        progressively more interventionist, strategies. The conclusion was that we
                        were able to handle virtually any contingency from our facilities in Puerto
                        Rico and the Canal Zone. This pointed up a general lesson, viz. that the
                        United States has a great deal of valuable territory suitable for support of
                        various overseas strategies (e.g., Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii
                        and Guam, and our possessions in the Caribbean).</p>
                    <p>The other point to make was related to the importance of control over the
                        Atlantic Narrows in the event of conventional war. In this connection, our
                        access and overflight rights in Brazil were of considerable value.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the <hi rend="italic">Near East</hi>, the main contingency,
                        although it was not used as the basic situation, was that of an Arab-Israeli
                        confrontation leading to United States involvement.</p>
                    <p>The main conclusion for this region was this: the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> envisaged a maximal United States deployment of three
                        divisions and 19 tactical air squadrons in support of Iran. The analysis has
                        shown that such a deployment would not be feasible without additional access
                        rights in Liberia, Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia.</p>
                    <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean</hi> area, all the alternatives pointed
                        to the importance of Diego Garcia as a supply base and staging area. Even
                        the Indian leadership, as it became more alarmed at Soviet activities,
                        seemed to find such a facility less and less objectionable. For example, the
                        possible deployment of Poseidon-armed nuclear subs would be much easier to
                        handle from this island base.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName>McClintock</persName> then summarized some general
                        conclusions.</p>
                    <p>General <persName>Wood</persName> had objected to firm policy/strategy
                        recommendations but had concurred in setting forth a series of findings.
                        Some of these were: <list>
                            <item>—First, the value of our security talks with Japan and Australia.
                                In this connection, the question arose whether similar security
                                talks at an appropriate level might perhaps be desirable with the
                                Philippines.</item>
                            <item>—Second, the desirability that Ambassadors and unified commanders
                                be asked for periodic assessment of the capabilities of their
                                facilities, so that the Executive Branch has a better, more
                                up-to-date understanding of what these facilities are capable of and
                                how they can support functional or regional requirements.</item>
                            <item>—Third, the importance of economic and military assistance as a
                                way to preserve access and staging rights and build up local forces
                                in lieu of United States deployments.</item>
                            <item>—Fourth, the fact that research and development can be useful in
                                reducing requirements in host countries. This had to be qualified in
                                the sense that scientists and engineers were not sensitive to the
                                need to avoid proliferation of our overseas bases and
                                facilities.</item>
                            <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0805"/>
                            <item>—Fifth, the fact that withdrawal of United States forces from
                                forward positions may increase, rather than decrease, budget costs
                                because of the expense of relocating troops and facilities.</item>
                            <item>—Sixth, the point that certain base systems, such as those in the
                                Western Hemisphere, can support multiple strategies and are not tied
                                to any specific regional strategy.</item>
                            <item>—Seventh, the continued importance of certain naval base
                                facilities in Western Europe and the Mediterranean.</item>
                            <item>—Eighth, the fact that reversion of Okinawa is inevitable. We
                                would be better off trying to make the best possible deal rather
                                than waiting until reversion is forced upon us. On the other hand,
                                there was no reason to give up more than administrative
                                responsibility [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>].</item>
                            <item>—Ninth, the desirability of taking another close look at the
                                possible uses of Sattahip and Singapore in support of United States
                                deployments, the latter through commercial arrangements using the
                                facilities left behind by the British.</item>
                            <item>—Tenth, the fact that staging and overflight rights in Africa and
                                Latin America cannot be secured except on an ad hoc basis. We would
                                have to be reconciled to this situation over the foreseeable
                                future.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, Ambassador <persName>McClintock</persName> said he would like
                        to emphasize that preparation of this Study was a massive worldwide effort.
                        The Group had enjoyed excellent cooperation from the Unified Commands,
                        notably General <persName>Lemnitzer</persName> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, as well as the various
                        Ambassadors.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">C. Discussion</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Barr</persName>
                        <note n="4" xml:id="d225fn4">Joseph W. Barr, Under Secretary of the
                            Treasury.</note> wondered about the costs of strategies that envisaged
                        withdrawal of our forces from forward positions. He felt that a distinction
                        should be made between budgetary and foreign exchange costs. Ambassador
                            <persName>McClintock</persName> agreed that redeployment of our forces
                        to the dollar area, while costly in budgetary terms, would yield sizable
                        foreign exchange savings. Budgetary costs and IBOP savings for each
                        alternative are contained in the Study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Eugene Rostow</persName> said that he found our staging rights
                        in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf area quite unsatisfactory. As of now, our
                        forces would be severely handicapped if they had to enter the Gulf. A United
                        States presence in this area was important in view of the rivalry between
                        the Shah and the Arabs and the importance of the oil supplies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE2">Bohlen</persName> asked about the status of
                        Diego Garcia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said that he
                        had authorized a construction survey and that construction funds had been
                        included in the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70 Defense budget. The
                        cost of the planned installation was estimated at $26 million. The
                        diplomatic side of this problem had been solved.</p>
                    <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0806"/>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> said he wanted to
                        elaborate on the Study’s cost estimates. These all assumed constant force
                        levels. The costs and savings shown resulted from different deployment
                        patterns exclusively. In this respect, the Study differed from others which
                        usually included savings resulting from changes in force structure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Poats</persName> suggested that the funding of base rentals be
                        examined on a world-wide basis. In the case of Spanish facilities, this was
                        a problem in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 70. If it was decided to put
                        the Spanish <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> into the Defense budget, the
                        question arose whether this principle should not also be followed for other
                        military assistance programs, which in effect represent a rental
                        payment.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                        <hi rend="italic">D. Disposition of the Study</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> then discussed next steps for review
                        and disposition of the Study.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> observed that, in his
                        view, this was a matter for the next Administration. The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> should, however, make interim arrangements
                        to permit some follow-on work to go forward until the new Administration
                        could decide on its own arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In addition, he felt it was very important not to foreclose any of the new
                        Administration’s options by premature disclosures. The Study contained
                        extremely sensitive information. He saw some danger that bits and pieces
                        would leak out, conveying a totally erroneous impression.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, he would like to propose: <list>
                            <item>—First, recipients personally take responsibility to restrict
                                distribution of the document in their own departments. As regards
                                the State Department, those with a need to know, essentially the
                                Assistant Secretaries, had copies. No further distribution was
                                contemplated.</item>
                            <item>—Second, there would be no distribution beyond that already made
                                between now and January 20. In particular, he did not believe there
                                should be an overseas distribution until the new Administration has

                                whether the whole report should be distributed. It might be
                                preferable to limit distribution to pertinent portions of the
                                report, i.e. a “sanitized” version containing all those sections
                                pertinent to the addressee.</item>

                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he would like the
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to study the various strategies
                        contained in the paper. He would like the Chief to begin thinking about
                        alternative regional strategies in these terms. He felt the Study contained
                        important material for the next Administration’s policy making.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said he had no
                        particular difficulty with an internal <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        distribution on a need-to-know basis. In some respect, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                        <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0807"/>staff was perhaps more familiar
                        with handling this kind of document. This also applied to the intelligence
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Barr</persName> said he would like Treasury to review the
                        foreign exchange cost estimates. What was important about these estimates
                        was not only the overall balance of payments cost of the various strategies,
                        but also where the balance of payments drain was occurring—whether it
                        involved, e.g., Japan, Germany or the franc area.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName>Barr</persName> agreed that it was unlikely Treasury would be
                        able to do much work on this problem before January 20 and that only part of
                        the information was actually needed for review purposes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> emphasized that he did
                        not advocate a rewriting of the Study. The Study was there to use. Rather,
                        he was proposing that pertinent portions be excerpted from the complete
                        report for further follow-on work on a need-to-know basis.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> then discussed the Study Group’s
                        proposal to cost and additional strategies in greater detail—similar to the
                        costing in <ref target="frus1964-68v02">Volume VII</ref> on West Pac. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> observed that the
                        Study Group would require policy guidance on which of the various
                        alternatives were worthy of further analysis. This guidance would have to
                        come from the new Administration.</p>
                    <p>Another problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said,
                        was that the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> did not know how the new
                        Administration wanted to organize the national security process and,
                        therefore, how to dispose of a study of this kind. (A similar problem
                        existed with respect to a number of other <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> projects.) He would like to entrust to the
                        Political-Military Group responsibility for further work, including: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Coordination of the interdepartmental review; and,</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The preparation of appropriate recommendations.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>He thought it better that the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> assign
                        responsibilities which the new Administration then could approve or modify
                        as it saw fit. He did not feel that these arrangements would preempt the new
                        Administration’s options. The Political-Military Group would not be able to
                        do more than begin the review of this massive study between now and January
                        20.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said the proposal was
                        to include intelligence facilities under these arrangements, with the
                        understanding that the Political-Military Group would redelegate the
                        intelligence part to a more restricted sub-group.</p>
                    <p>The intelligence facilities were of course a separate system. But, as the
                        report recognized, there was a relationship between these facilities and
                        other installations. There was need for a central point where conclusions
                        about these various systems could be put together.</p>
                    <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0808"/>
                    <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> agreed that further
                        work was needed on the intelligence parts of the Study. He found composition
                        of the Political-Military Group somewhat amorphous. The membership appeared
                        to vary from problem to problem. He would designate Major Gen.
                            <persName>John M. Reynolds</persName> as the Agency’s representative for
                        this purpose. Also, the intelligence chapter should be taken up in a special
                        sub-group of the <gloss target="#t_PMG1">PMG</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>As regards the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> suggested that the <gloss target="#t_PMG1">PMG</gloss> try to identify specific issues on which it
                        would like to have the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s’ views and
                        recommendations. (The <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s would, of course,
                        be free to comment on other pertinent aspects of the Study.)</p>
                    <p>The suggestion was made that the <gloss target="#t_PMG1">PMG</gloss> might
                        want to use a few of the more experienced cost analysts of the Study Group
                        for its follow-on work.</p>
                    <p>Before adjourning, the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> briefly took up

                    <p>At its 48th meeting on December 19, 1968, the Senior Interdepartmental Group
                        received a report on the results of the overseas base study undertaken by
                        the joint State/Defense Study Group.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">See <ref target="#d225">Document 225</ref> and footnote <ref target="#d2">2</ref> thereto.</note>

                    <p>To this end, the five <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s are requested to
                        review appropriate sections of the Study and submit their conclusions and
                        recommendations to the Political-Military Group. Taking these views and
                        recommendations into account, the Political-Military Group is requested to
                        submit its recommendations on further action to the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> by March 1, 1969.</p>
                    <p>These should, to the extent feasible, include recommendations regarding (1)
                        working assumptions on the strategies which should guide future base
                        planning; (2) bases in which significant changes could be made in the near

                        in the 1970s; (4) bases in which no significant changes can be foreseen; and
                        (5) any steps that should be taken to improve the examination of future base
                        problems in the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>A special sub-group with appropriate membership shall be established to
                        review the intelligence chapter and submit appropriate recommendations.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, it is understood that the <gloss target="#t_PMG1">PMG</gloss>
                        may ask the State/Defense Study Group to reconstitute the special sub-group
                        that prepared Annex J to cost out additional alternative base structures for
                        strategies in various regions.</p>
                    <p>To ensure a systematic unified review of the Study’s findings, the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> noted the desirability that the
                        Political-Military Group be free to <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0810"/>pose specific issues for the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s to
                        consider. Review of the Study by the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s
                        would not, however, be restricted to these specific issues; rather the
                            <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s should be free to comment on any
                        other points pertinent to their jurisdiction. The Political-Military Group’s
                        final report should discuss remaining differences on conclusions and
                        recommendations between the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>s and the
                        Political-Military Group.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> also agreed that the Study not be

                        to take responsibility for the handling of this sensitive document within
                        their respective agencies. No field distribution is contemplated pending
                        additional guidance from the new Administration. The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> Staff Director should be consulted on such limited
                        additional distributions as may be necessary in the several agencies to
                        commence review of the report.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> also agreed that, as a general
                        principle, access to the document in the agencies should be restricted to a
                        need-to-know basis. Furthermore, access by staffs should be limited to those
                        portions of the Study actually required for review purposes.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> also considered the question of
                        Congressional briefings and consultations. It noted that the existence of
                        the Study had received considerable attention in the press, and that
                        Congressional inquiries might be expected from time to time. The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> agreed that it would be premature to brief
                        members of the Congress on the contents of the report inasmuch as: <list>

                            Study Group. The results have been submitted to the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> on 19 December and contain no specific
                            recommendations, but are simply designed to aid those who will face
                            future policy decisions. It would not be appropriate to discuss the
